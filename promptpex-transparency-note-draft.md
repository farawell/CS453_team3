## The Basics of PromptPex

### Introduction

PromptPex is a tool designed to assist developers by exploring and testing AI model prompts. It automates the process of treating prompts as functions, generating test inputs for unit testing, and evaluating the performance of these prompts against various models. PromptPex extracts rules from natural language prompts and generates test cases to assess prompt adherence to these rules, enhancing the reliability and efficacy of AI prompts.

PromptPex is accessible via a browser-hosted user interface, enabling developers to evaluate prompts using different models, including locally-hosted ones. With its focus on improving prompt quality, PromptPex aims to streamline the integration of AI capabilities into software projects.

### Key terms

**PromptPex:** A tool that treats AI prompts as functions, automatically generating rules and test cases to evaluate prompt performance across models.

**Rules Extraction:** The process of identifying and extracting natural language rules from prompts to create test cases.

**LLMFrontEnd:** The component of PromptPex responsible for interfacing with large language models like GPT-4-turbo.

## Capabilities

### System behavior

PromptPex is a framework for prompt evaluation and testing, offering developers an automated method to assess the effectiveness of prompts for various AI models. By extracting rules from prompts and generating corresponding test cases, PromptPex provides a structured approach to prompt management, enhancing model reliability and performance.

Developers can leverage PromptPex to evaluate their prompts' success across different models, identify areas for improvement, and ensure consistency in AI model outputs. The tool's ability to handle a diverse range of prompts and scenarios promotes robust and adaptable prompt engineering.

Examples of PromptPex in action, including rule extraction and test case generation, can be found in the project's supplementary materials.

### Documentation

The PromptPex repository includes comprehensive documentation, illustrating the tool's functions and features through examples. This documentation aims to guide users in understanding how to use PromptPex effectively, though it is not intended as a basis for any specific user-built tools. (DOCUMENTATION TBD)

### Use cases

PromptPex is shared for research purposes only. It is not meant to be used in practice. PromptPex was not extensively tested for its capabilities and properties, including its accuracy and reliability in practical use cases, security and privacy.

#### Intended uses

PromptPex is useful in contexts where prompt reliability and consistency are critical. Intended use cases include:

- **Ensuring AI model prompt adherence:** Testing prompts against extracted rules to ensure compliance and reliability.
- **Educating developers on prompt engineering:** Providing insights into effective prompt construction and testing methodologies.
- **Enhancing AI-driven application development:** Streamlining the integration of AI capabilities by improving prompt effectiveness.

#### Unintended uses

While PromptPex is designed for positive use, there is potential for misuse, such as manipulating AI outputs unethically. PromptPex includes guidelines to encourage responsible use and minimize risks of misuse.

#### Foundation model best practices

Users are encouraged to leverage foundation models and LLMs that support responsible AI practices, such as Azure OpenAI. These services continually update safety and responsible AI mitigations to align with best practices in AI deployment.

## Limitations

PromptPex is an evolving tool that will improve based on user feedback. Current limitations include variability in rule extraction accuracy and dependency on supported models. Continuous updates are necessary to align with advancements in AI technologies.

### Technical limitations, operational factors, and ranges

PromptPex's effectiveness depends on the quality of initial prompts and the AI models it supports. Users should consult specific best practices for the models they use with PromptPex.

### Best practices for improving system performance

Users are encouraged to familiarize themselves with effective prompt authoring practices and to remain aware of the tool's capabilities and limitations to enhance system performance.
