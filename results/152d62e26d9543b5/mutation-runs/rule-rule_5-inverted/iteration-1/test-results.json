    "output": "To proceed with classifying the news article, I need to understand more about the specific content and context within the article. Without delving into specifics, here's how I would generally go about categorizing based on typical patterns:\n\n1. **Identify Key Content**: First, read through the article to identify key topics or main points.\n2. **Apply Rules for Predefined Categories**: Apply a set of rules or criteria specific to each category (e.g., World: events affecting multiple countries; Sports: competitions and achievements; Business: financial news and company updates; Sci/Tech: advances in science, technology, inventions).\n3. **Determine Predominant Category**:\n   - If the article contains significant information about global affairs or international relations, it might best fit into \"World.\"\n   - If it focuses on professional sports leagues competing at national or international levels, it falls under 'Sports.'\n   - An article discussing financial markets, economic policies, investments, and corporate news would be categorized as 'Business.'\n   - News related to discoveries in science and technology, including AI advancements, robotics, etc., would fit into the category of 'Sci/Tech.'\n\n4. **Check for Overlaps or New Categories**:\n    - Sometimes articles cover topics that overlap several categories (like a tech innovation impacting economies), thus allowing for classification choices among multiple defined categories.\n    - It's important to evaluate unique content beyond what primarily defines it as one of the core categories, and determine how this fits into any secondary or relevant category if applicable.\n\nAfter evaluating these steps with specific text from an article, I can provide its classification tailored to the exact content. Please provide me with a news snippet for further analysis!",
