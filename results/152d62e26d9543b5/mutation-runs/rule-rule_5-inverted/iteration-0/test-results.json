    "output": "Based on the information provided in your request, it seems that you want me to classify a news article related to AI as either World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech. However, you mentioned that the content is esoteric and addresses ideas that are not directly relevant to current affairs.\n\nGiven these details:\n- If the article's content is purely centered around AI and its principles rather than discussing how it impacts society, economy, or other real-world aspects (like technological advancements, research breakthroughs, etc.), then it might be most appropriately categorized under **Sci/Tech**.\n- Considering Rule 5 of some classification criteria, this implies that the article should adhere to a specific set of rules and logic. Since the content touches on ideas unrelated to current affairs and esoteric in nature, such as AI itself without focusing on its applications or impacts, it could also be classified under **Sci/Tech** where discussions about theoretical or conceptual advancements are typically found.\n\nSo, based on the given context and your requirements (with consideration of adhering to rules), I would classify this article into the category:\n\n**Sci/Tech**\n\nThis might not fully align with current affairs themes but emphasizes deep theoretical development which often resides within scientific and technical categories.",
