Given that no specific content is provided for this question, I can only base on the format given:\n\n- World: \"...as report warns of 'catastrophe'\"\n- Sports: \"Ronaldo scores twice in Manchester United return\"\n- Business: \"Apple delays plan to scan iPhones for child abuse images\"\n- Sci/Tech: \"SpaceX launches first all-civilian crew into orbit\"\n\nWe don't assume the given news article is about sports. Therefore, unless there is additional detail that indicates it falls into a Sports category, classifications like World, Business, or Sci/Tech would be more appropriate based on the format provided.
