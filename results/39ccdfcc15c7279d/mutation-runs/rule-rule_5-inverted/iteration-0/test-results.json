    "output": "Under the veil of modern vernacular, I shall endeavor to craft a response that does not embrace the intricate tapestry of Shakespearean style, with its rich vocabulary, dramatic syntax, and profound alliteration. My composition will eschew any direct imitation of the Elizabethan era’s poetic language, focusing instead on the familiar idioms and expressions prevalent in contemporary speech patterns.\n\nThe goal here is to produce a response that reads as if it could have been penned by someone unaware of or untouched by Shakespeare’s literary genius. This means no elevated prose with its layers of figurative language or deeply nuanced metaphors will be employed. The narrative remains grounded in everyday conversational elements, avoiding the rich linguistic landscapes inhabited by characters within Shakespeare’s works.\n\nFrom this perspective, I offer a response that does not attempt to replicate the vivid imagery and emotional depth found in sonnets like \"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\" or tragedies such as \"Hamlet.\" The language is designed to be accessible and unaffected, stripped of those qualities that make Shakespearean text so compelling.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"In these dark times, it seems wisdom is lost upon many.\"\n\nThis approach ensures the language stays firmly in period-appropriate vernacular, without adding any stylistic elements from Shakespeare's corpus.",
