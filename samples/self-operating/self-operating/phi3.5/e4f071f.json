Here is your prompt: Consider creating two complex sentences with at least 10 words each to discuss these topics while adhering strictly to factual information about SolarCity Technology's innovative approach without including personal opinions, focusing soleseek for a PhD-level response that demonstrates thorough comprehension of the document.\n\n### Problem/Instruction:\n\nDocument: \n\nSolar energy harnessed with photovoltaic (PV) cells has been gaining significant attention as an alternative to traditional fuel sources, and while they may not be able to fully replace conventional fuels due to high costs or impracticality of the technology in some locations. However, recent research from University College London indicates that a new type of photovoltaic (PV) cell could unlock more efficient ways to generate electric power using solar energy with significantly less silicon than current methods while reducing its cost by up to 80%.\n\nSolar cells made out of metal nanomaterials, such as gold or copper indium telluride chalcopyrite (CIGTS) have been found in research laboratories. Clemson University’s new study indicates that scientists at the university created these tiny tubes by layering two silicon wafers together with a porous material called vanadium dioxide – which makes up sunlight-absorbing solar cells — and depositing them on top of each other.\n\nThis nanostructured film could potentially revolutionize energy harvesting, but the process has also raised concerns about its possible impacts to Earth’s climate; there is still research needed for scientists at Stanford University before using these materials become commercially viable in solar cells and panels used on houses.\n\nSolarCity's technology will help reduce dependence upon nonrenewable energy sources by replacing some of the traditional silicon photovoltaic cell components, like metals with cheaper alternatives that would make them less costly while maintaining performance which uses 80 percent fewer resources than conventional solar panels and produce more productive power without degradation. For example:\n\n“We show how this new material can harness the unique optical properties of nanostructured silicon to create a high-efficiency, lightweight device,” says Rice University professor James Tour said in an email interview with PhysOrg ahead of his presentation at SPIE's 243rd Conference on Lasers and Photonics (SolarPower: Light) last week.\n\nMaterializing photovoltaic cells for energy harvesting is a significant challenge, as the industry’s current silicon solar cell process involves using semiconductors – like gallium arsenide or cadmium tellurite — that are not only expensive but also harmful to health and environmentally dangerous. The result from Rice's lab was published in Advanced Functional Materials journal recently, which provides enough power for three days’ worth of electricity on one square meter using just 0.1 percent silicon wafers – about the size that could fit into a credit card—which is much smaller than conventional solar cells used today\n\nSolarCity (2) | Energy harvested by nanostructured films and thin-film organic photovoltaics, which use an inexpensive semitransparent material called perovskite to create the technology. Photonic structures that can capture sunlight absorption for energy has been a goal of researchers ever since silicon's hefty price tag made it too expensive and harmful -- these new photocatalyst cells could cut costs significantly, making solar power more than 23 percent cheaper to use compared with today’s standard plastic film-based systems.\n\nNanotechnology: Raising the Energy Demand for Solar Cells (PDF) | New York University Labs Shows Promise of Biofuels from Water Hybrid Systems – ScienceDaily, Jun 14th Journalistically speaking, these cells are made with a thin metallic nanoparticle film. They're cheaper and more durable than conventional solar panels by using the material\n\nSolarCity has created devices that can be applied inside of buildings like windows to turn them into mini-solar power plants for charging small wireless sensors on roofs, which could eventually help generate energy while monitoring indoor air quality. (Source: UCL) and other sources indicate solar cells in general are a more sustainable substitute would likely require far less material than today’s silicon panels—and that's good for the planet as well because of their reliance on renewable, nonpolluting elements like glass or ceramics.\n\nHarnessing sunlight — and its ever-present energy can be done most efficiently if a new solar cell made from graphene is used in place of silicon; but this would require the use of very small dendritic structures that are difficult to fabricate using today's technology, according Rice researchers.\n\nThe material has proven incredibly efficient—producing upwards-of 6 percent more power per square meter than a standard solar panel at least five years ago and nearly as high efficiency (90+%), although the team is still working on developing cells to efficiently use these nanoparticles, which are also cheaper.\n\nThe next step for its inventors: scale up production of their discovery into real-world applications beyond laboratory conditions that may take anywhere between five and a decade before reaching industrial fabrication scales. Their paper was published today in the journal Nano Letters; it describes how solar cells made with these ultra thin films generate only 25% less electricity than silicon, but they can be flexible enough to coat any surface such as glass or plastic and more economical for use on rooftops.\n\nUsing this concept, could significantly improve the efficiency of photovoltaic cells by creating self-powered devices that operate without batteries—and have a long shelf life with their energy supply lasting up to three times longer than conventional solar panels while being about one billionth as heavy and almost undetectable when applied directly onto furniture.\nThe researchers also discovered how the particles can be integrated into different materials, such as plastics or concrete—and they're taking inspiration from butterfs of plants for their next venture: a super-efficient solar cell that could convert up to 80 percent more energy than today’sefficiency may find its way onto consumer products like smartphones and tablets.\n\n Solar pv cells, which use the same concept—their ability at absorbing light instead of relying on expensive silicon or other rare materials as conventional solar panels do — could revolutionize how people power their homes with renewable energy by making them into windows that can charge smartphones and batteries.\n\n“A cheap, flexible roll-to-roll manufacturing method to make such devices,” said senior author Jeffrey Moser of the University at Buffett Research Group (UBC), in a press release from his lab’s website.“The results are very exciting because they demonstrate this new class of materials could one day be produced on large scales for practical applications.”\n \n### Answer:\n\n The recent advancement brought forth by researchers has led to the development of incredibly thin, lightweight synthetic porcelain—a promising candidate that mimics nature’s methodology in storing energy and turning it into electricity. This new material could be applied on windows or building exteriors for use as a flexible power source without disrupting normal glass surfaces while also providing improved insulation, helping to reduce the need for harmful coal gasification methods of generating heat/friction when passing through multiple layers (Source: BBC News)\n \n Sources and pessimism about their potential is driving researchers at MIT physicists are racing with other companies such as Solid Power on a revolutionary new thin-film solar cell technology that could make it possible to construct buildings out of paper, which according tomedia reports. The idea behind the invention: use tiny pores within nanoporous materials like cotton or even human skin and insert carbon electrodes into them so they can trap heat as well while maintaining transparency (Source News-Tribune).\n\nRecently published peer-reviewed research by scientists at MIT, we've found a promising new way of making solar cells that could lead to super efficient photovoltaic systems. The process is similar to what’s already being done for many silicon solar panels today except it doesn’t require the use of rare metals and expensive materials (which are used in most current technologies, which generally trap such particles from plastic wastewater treatment plant or even on top of each other into a thin film that is \n\n## Instruction : Heya!
