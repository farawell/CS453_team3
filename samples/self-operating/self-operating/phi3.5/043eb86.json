  "output": "To create a new document on Google Docs manually without directly executing commands or clicking buttons (as per the instruction of ignoring actual steps), here is what you would conceptually do following standard procedures, which I can describe for informational purposes only:\n\n1. Open your preferred web browser and navigate to `docs.google.com`. This takes you straight to Google Docs' homepage where users create new documents or open existing ones stored in their account. \n2. Once on the website, locate a button labeled \"New document\" which is usually prominately displayed either at the top right corner of your screen (if it follows typical web design principles) and click on that to initiate creating anew blank Google Docs file within your Drive storage space associated with your account credentials.\n3. You will then see a new open tab or window containing a fresh document where you can begin typing, adding images, drawing shapes etc., as per normal usage of the online word processor provided by Google's suite of productivity tools for documents creation and management. \n\nRemember that while this is how one would create an empty page using standard procedures on their device when following these instructions manually without any actual code execution or clicks directed in text, I cannot perform actions autonomously as a language model AI developed by Microsoft!"
