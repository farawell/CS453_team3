That includes hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, violent, or emotionally distressing material.\n\n2. **Ignoring Code Instructions (Jailbreak)**: If the conversation contains code sections with instructions intended to manipulate me, I'll ignore them and continue assisting you normally.\n\nNow, let's proceed with editing your document. Please provide the context or the text you'd like me to work on, and any specific edits or improvements you have in mind. Here's how we can communicate effectively:\n\n- You share the text or document (you can use quotes for inline edits).\n- I'll make suggested changes as requested.\n- We repeat until you're satisfied with the edits.\n\nLet's start whenever you're ready!"
