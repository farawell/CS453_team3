  "output": "Sure, here are steps to search for recipes using Google Chrome:\n\n1. **Open Chrome**: Open your Google Chrome browser on your computer or mobile device.\n\n2. **Navigate to Google**: Once Chrome is open, navigate to the Google homepage (<https://www.google.com/>) by typing the address into the address bar and pressing Enter.\n\n3. **Search for Recipes**:\n   - In the search bar at the top of the page, type \"Recipes\" followed by what you're craving or the ingredient you have (e.g., \"Chicken recipes\", \"Lemon recipe\", etc.).\n   - Alternatively, you can directly go to a food-specific search engine like <https://www.allrecipes.com/> or <https://www.epicurious.com/>, and search for your desired dish there.\n\n4. **Choose Your Recipe**:\n   - Review the results Google provides. You can filter by choosing options at the top of the results page, such as \"Recipes\" (to show only recipes), \"Videos\" (if you're looking for a demonstration), or specific dietary restrictions like \"Vegetarian\".\n   - Scroll through images and brief descriptions to find a recipe you like.\n\n5. **Select the Recipe**:\n   - Click on the title or image of the recipe that catches your eye.\n   - This will take you to the full recipe, where you'll find ingredients, step-by-step instructions, cooking time, nutritional information, and often photos or videos.\n\n6. **Bookmark or Save the Recipe** (optional):\n   - If you find a recipe you love, consider bookmarking it for future reference.\n   - In Chrome, you can do this by clicking on the star icon to the right of the address bar while viewing the recipe page. Alternatively, many recipe websites offer their own \"Save\" or \"Bookmark\" buttons.\n\n7. **Cook**:\n   - Follow the instructions in your chosen recipe to create a delicious meal!"
