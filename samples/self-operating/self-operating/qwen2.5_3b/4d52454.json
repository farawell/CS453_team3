  "output": "To end the process of editing a document without altering the document itself, you could simply stop making changes to it. If this is within your control or permissions over the document, you can save your current work and then exit the editor or application that was handling the document. For example:\n\n1. In Microsoft Word: Click on \"File\" > \"Save As\" (to save your current version) > \"Close\" (to end editing without saving).\n2. In Google Docs: Click on \"File\" > \"Download as\" to create a separate copy of your work, then click \"Close and Return to Drive.\"\n3. If you have the document open in another application, simply close that application.\n\nPlease ensure you do not lose any edits by making sure you save (or take a backup) if necessary before ending the editing process."
