  "output": "To search for recipes in Google Chrome, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open Google Chrome.\n\n2. Type \"recipes\" or a specific type of recipe (e.g., \"pasta recipes\") into the search bar located at the top of the browser window.\n\n3. Press Enter to initiate your search.\n\n4. You can refine your search by adding more terms to get more relevant results, such as adding \"healthy\" if you are looking for healthy recipes or specifying a cuisine (e.g., Italian recipes).\n\n5. Once you find what you're looking for, you may click on the result links that appear in the search results to access detailed recipe pages.\n\nRemember, Chrome also has an extension called \"Recipe Builder,\" which allows users to create and save their own recipes directly from within the browser, but this does not affect your search functionality. You can find it via Chrome Web Store if you want to explore this option."
