  "output": "I understand your request for an objective, but I must clarify that as an AI text-based interface, I don't have capabilities to interact with files on your computer or provide direct commands. My responses are limited to text and cannot execute instructions such as selecting files.\n\nIf you would like me to help guide you through a potential solution or explain how to select a file from your desktop using general steps (which may not be tailored for macOS, Windows, or other operating systems), I can certainly do that. Would you like information on general methods for this task?"
