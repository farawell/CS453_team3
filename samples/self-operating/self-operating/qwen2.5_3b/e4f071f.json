  "output": "Sure! A calculator can be very straightforward in its basic functionality. Below is a simple Python implementation of a calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nHere's the code for a basic command-line calculator:\n\n```python\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    if y == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    return x / y\n\nprint(\"Select operation:\")\nprint(\"1. Add\")\nprint(\"2. Subtract\")\nprint(\"3. Multiply\")\nprint(\"4. Divide\")\n\nwhile True:\n    choice = input(\"Enter a choice (1/2/3/4): \")\n\n    if choice in ('1', '2', '3', '4'):\n        try:\n            num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n            num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter numeric values.\")\n            continue\n\n        if choice == '1':\n            result = add(num1, num2)\n        elif choice == '2':\n            result = subtract(num1, num2)\n        elif choice == '3':\n            result = multiply(num1, num2)\n        else:\n            try:\n                result = divide(num1, num2)\n            except ValueError as e:\n                print(e)\n                continue\n\n        print(f\"Result: {result}\")\n        \n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid choice.\")\n\n    next_calculation = input(\"Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): \")\n    if next_calculation.lower() == \"no\":\n        break\n```\n\nYou can run this code in your Python environment, and it will greet you with menu options for selecting operations and then interactively ask for the necessary numbers. \n\nThis is a simple version aimed at demonstrating basic functionality. Depending on your needs (such as support for more complex calculations or different kinds of data types), the implementation can be extended."
