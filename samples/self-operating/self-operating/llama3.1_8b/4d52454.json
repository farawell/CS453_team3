It's crucial to remember that this script closes the active application window, which might lead to data loss if not done carefully.\n\nAlso note, since you're asking on a public platform like GitHub, it would be better to directly ask your users for permission to close and save their files rather than automating it with scripts. Users will always appreciate being asked before actions affecting their work."
