  "output": " To start a new document on Google Docs, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) and go to the Google Docs website. You can do this by typing \"https://docs.google.com\" into your address bar and pressing Enter.\n\n2. If you are not already logged in to your Google account, log in using your Gmail credentials.\n\n3. Once you are logged in, you will see a blank document page with the title \"Untitled Document.\" At the top left of this page, click on the word \"Google Docs\" or the \"+\" icon if it is available. This will open a dropdown menu.\n\n4. In the dropdown menu, select the option that says \"New\". If you do not see this option, look for the plus (+) button and click on it instead. This action should bring up the following options:\n   - Blank (starts with a blank document)\n   - From template or example (allows you to create a new document based on a template or an example provided by Google Docs)\n   - Upload (enables you to upload files, such as documents, spreadsheets, or presentations)\n\n5. To start with a completely blank document, click on the \"Blank\" option in the dropdown menu under \"New\". This will create a new, untitled document for you to begin writing in.\n\n6. Now that you have started a new Google Docs document, feel free to add text, images, tables, or any other elements you would like by using the toolbar at the top of the page and the buttons available on the left side of the screen.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully navigate to Google Docs and create a new document as per your objective."
