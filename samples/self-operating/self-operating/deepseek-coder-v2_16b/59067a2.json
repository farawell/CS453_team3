It's typically represented by the `âŠž` symbol.\n2. **Type \"Chrome\"** into the Start menu that appears after pressing the Windows key. You should see an icon labeled \"Google Chrome.\"\n3. **Click on the Google Chrome icon**. This will launch Google Chrome and open a new tab in the browser.\n4. **Press the \"Tab\" key** to switch focus to the address bar at the top of the screen (the area where you usually type URLs). If you are already in the address bar, this step can be skipped.\n5. **Type \"cat pictures\"** into the address bar. You can do this by pressing the letter 'c', then 'a', then 't', followed by ' ', and finally 'p', 'i', 'c', 't', 'u', 'r', 'e', 's'.
