The output must include one of the four operation types: CLICK, TYPE, SEARCH, or DONE, each with a specific format based on the operation type.
The CLICK response must be in the format: CLICK {{ "x": "percent", "y": "percent", "description": "~description here~", "reason": "~reason here~" }} where "x" and "y" are percentages and "description" and "reason" provide context for the action.
The TYPE response must be in the format: TYPE "value you want to type" where the value is the exact string intended for typing.
