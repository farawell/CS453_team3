  "actualOutput": "The writer likes passages that maintain an optimistic tone through a first-person narrative voice while employing simple word choice to ensure accessibility for readers; both examples utilize complex sentence structures paired with short paragraphs designed for clarity, suggesting the author'impreference towards elaborate prose and value in directness of expression.\n\nIn these summaries provided by justifications from Passage 1 and Passage 2:\n- The commonality is clear; both passages share an optimistic tone which reflects a positive outlook or attitude conveyed through the writing, instilling hopeful sentiments within their content without being negative.\n- They are told in first person narrative voice—this choice of perspective provides immediacy and intimacy to readers as they feel directly addressed by someone recounting personal experiences or reflections; this aligns with common likes where writers wish for a connection that seems more relatable than third-person accounts.\n- Simple word choices are selected in both instances, aimed at making the text easily understandable and approachable to a broad audience without overly complex vocabulary barriers which often alienate less proficient readers or discourage continuous reading among those not yet advanced in their language skills; it indicates that writers who prefer such passages value clarity.\n- Complex sentence structures appear within both examples, indicating an appreciation for rich and potentially nuanced ways of conveying ideas despite maintaining simplicity elsewhere—writers like these might enjoy the challenge or depth they can afford without sacrificing readability entirely because their audience is likely to be comfortable with varied syntactic constructions.\n- Finally, each passage employs short paragraphs; this structure aids in digestibility and flow for readers who may get lost over excessively long strets of text—this indicates that writers like these appreciate directness where information or narrative progression is presented straightforwardly without the need to navigate through dense blocks.\n- The summarized preference illustrates an emphasis on positivity, relatability, clarity in writing style and structure which align with crafting content meant for wide comprehension while still being intellectually engaging—it's a balance of form (structure) meeting function (communicative effectiveness).",
