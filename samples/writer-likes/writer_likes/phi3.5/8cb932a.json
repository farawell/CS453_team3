  "actualOutput": "The writer likes to engage with passages that maintain a formal tone throughout, employing third-person objective voice which provides an impartial narrative stance. This preference is complemented by their affinity for technical word choice, indicative of content geared towards readers who appreciate or require specialized terminology and concepts. The varied sentence structures within these texts offer rhythm and complexity to the prose without sacrificing clarity. Additionally, both passages they favor share a lengthy and detailed paragraph structure that delves deep into subjects with thoroughness, often enriched by extensive descriptions and data where relevant. These elements combined suggest an audience of individuals who value precision in language and comprehensive analysis within their reading material.\n\nIn each sentence:\n- \"The writer likes\" introduces the summary's focus on reader preferences.\n- The repetition emphasizes that both passages share these common qualities, reinforcing consistency across examples mentioned by justifications (such as maintaining a formal tone and employing technical word choice which reflect specialized interests). \n- Details about sentence structure were included to highlight the writer'se preference for complexity within readability.\n- Paragraph structural similarities point towards an appreciation of content with depth, suggesting these readers likely enjoy or benefit from extensive detail (the \"lengthy and detailed\" aspect), which aligns well with those who look for comprehensive analysis in texts they find engaging (\"enriched by extended descriptions\").\n- The explanation is precise as it isolates the specific elements that characterize what the writer likes, using them to summarily describe their reading material preferences.",
