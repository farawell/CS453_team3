  "Rule ID": "2",
  "Test ID": "1",
  "Test Input": "Passage 1: Tone: Formal, Voice: Third-person narrative, Word Choice: Complex, Sentence Structure: Varied, Paragraph Structure: Mixed. Passage 2: Tone: Casual, Voice: First-person narrative, Word Choice: Simple, Sentence Structure: Simple, Paragraph Structure: Consistent.",
  "Expected Output": "The writer dislikes...",
  "Reasoning": "Challenges the software to recognize the absence of common stylistic elements and reflect this in multiple ambiguous sentences.",
  "model": "phi3.5",
  "actualOutput": "The writer likely appreciates complex and varied sentence structures in writing with a formal tone but may also enjoy the contrast provided by simpler constructions found within first-person or casual narratives for relatability; they seem to value diversity in paragraph structure, ranging from mixed forms of organization. While Passage 1's third-person voice and complex vocabulary cater to a more academic or professional setting that demands attention to detail and an impersonal tone, the complexity here is not justified by simplicity as seen when contrasted with Passage 2â€™s consistent simple structure aligned with its casual first-person narrative which might appeal for accessibility. These preferences suggest the writer enjoys sophisticated language used in formal contexts but also recognizes and possibly prefers simpler, more personal storytelling methods that foster connection through direct voice use without complex sentence constructions or a varied paragraph structure found within their favored tone-rich writing style of Passage 1.",
