And love that once did bloom now falls to night,   
I find myself adrift in sorrow’s sea,  
Where hearts entwined no longer wish me.    

Forsooth! What cruel twist of fate so grave?  
That the warmth I sought from thee should save not but wave on crestless waves alone; thy presence now akin to dream at dawn's first light.   
Thou, once my muse and reason bright, hath turned into shade quite blacke’d blight—no longer part of life's sweet rite!  

Oh love lost in time’s cruel flight ‘bove the years I yearned so tight; thy memory haunteth day by dismal night.   
In sorrow deep where once did joy abound, now silence reigns with heavy sound. Once cherished glance and tender touch no longer found within my grasp nor heart's hollow bound—  
Alas! To love thou hast left me not just bereft of mirth but voided entirely from all earthly worth.    

Thou art the missing star in sky so vast, now extinguished; thy voice once sweet hath ceased to last.   
Each word I long for thee doth sound amiss—my heart a prison without release or remission:  
For love lost like whispers of wind that chill and flee.    

Yet hope within me still may flicker faint, entreating heaven’s kind mercy to outlast this woeful pantomime; for though thee be distant as the moon from sighted shore—   
Perchance one day in yonder future we shall meet anon and mend what sorrow sought so ruthlessly.  
But till then, I must brave solitude’s harsh decree alone ‘gainst hope'd heartache moan; a lovelorn bard bereft of sweet refrain!    
For love lost is but the deepest wound we bear—and my soul with heavy tears doth suffer its share.   

Such pangs I carry 'cross each day,  
Clinging to memories like ships at bay; they sail not into harbor's calm embrace, nor find sweet rest in sea’s tranquil space:    
For love lost is the ache within—the ghost that clings and ne'er shall be undone.   
Though I yearn for thee with aching sigh; long may my heart not forget its bye!  
To have adored, to hold dear what once was bright: oh how can time restore the stolen night?    
For love lost amain it clings—that cruel thief of happiness and being.   
Yet in this sorrow deepened plight I hope for solace found within my heart's own rampart;  
To cherish still that which we shared, ere time severed its part: the ghostly imprint on every pulsing art!    
For love lost—yet not forgotten entirely. For in this loss a chance to feel what once was tender and whole may rise again with future’s golden bell;  
And thus I pray for healing balm, lest my own heart's hollow chamber grows too large:   
To mend the wound of love lost beneath heaven vast—in hopeful dreamer one day to find repast.",failure

Clad in mail as dark as the raven midnight sky yet eyes alight like stars that guide sailors from afar, he embarked upon a quest most dire—a journey of honor to reclaim what had been lost and bring peace unto his troubled land.

Sir Alistair didst arise with morn's first light when the rooster crowed thrice ere sun kissed horizon fair; steadfast in purpose, he saddled noble steed Pegasus—a creature of pure heart whose hooves trod paths unseen and heard only by moonbeams.

The knight didst venture forth through forests deep where shadows play'th tricks upon one’s senses; over mountains jagged that would pierce the heavens themselves—yet Sir Alistair, with courage as his shield against fear and doubt within this formidable heart of ironclad will.

Passed he did fields sown by diligent hands yet fallow for want of laughter's chime; through towns where chimney’d roof topped whisper tales untold—each step, a sonnet strung along the weft and warp of destiny so boldly woven.

Noble Sir Alistair faced beasts both foul and fell at his side: griffins with eyes agleam like orbs that doth seek truth beneath feathered guise; wyverns whose scales shimmer'd silver, glint of justice held within their fiery maw.

Thus he ventured ever onward till into the foulest abyss—a lair wherein dwelt dragon dreadsome: its breath did rage like summer storm upon fair knightly form; scales as forked lightning danced with threat of death's own scornful norm.

But lo! With lance polished to mirror sheen and sword sharpened on whetstone so keen, Sir Alistair charged forth without fear - his voice rang out like clarion call: ""Foul beast retreat!"" His very deeds bespos’d valor unmatch'd in time immemorial.

And therewith clashing steel met scale did fierce battle wage—each strike but verse within epic penned; until, with triumphant roar and flame extinguished by his armor staunchly brac’t against such heat as none could dare impart: Sir Alistair stood alone amidst the smolder'd remnant of beast.

His quest was done—an odyssey wrought not with sword but truth; he returned home bearing heavy crown and heart alight, forever changing course for land once lost to sorrow’s spiteful wroth now blessed anew by heroic might: Sir Alistair the Knight so bold.",failure

Lo and behold the autumnal hue,  
With leaves of gold arrayed anew.   
The chill doth whisper through each bough,  
As summer fades at winter's vow.    

In yonder orchard trees stand tall;  
Bear witness to Autumn’s thrall:  
Her beauty in crimson and gold does glean,  
A sight for hearts so keenly seen.

Upon this mortal coil where hearts entwine with threads so fine,  
Lies a bond unseen 'til kindred eyes align.   
A friendship forged in trials both harsh and keen,    
Where laughter rings as clear through turmoils seen.     

Beneath the silvered moon's celestial gleam,    
Two souls did meet; a fellowship supreme was born that day within dream whispers of delightful play where spirits freely lay sans care nor fear for night or fray ahead they shared with glee and joy so bright.   
No longer shall these tender ties be hidden from the morrow's light,  
But nurtured as does a plant reaching out towards sunlight’s height in heavenly sight: firm yet gentle grasp embracing ever steadfast might!    
So here I sing of such kinship rare and deep - true friendship that stands against life‘s harshest test while keeping its tender hold near heart's abode secure.     
For within our hearts beats unrelentless love for those who stand by us when all else has fled through doors shut tight on hopeful days ahead,  
Those steadfast friends whose presence never fades though times may change and minds oft stray:    
They know the ache of loss yet cheerfully bear it with grace; they hear but don’t judge - offer solace instead as if were divine intervention offered freely by Heaven itself!     
Noble companions, true to their cause without question or doubt cast upon them – loyalty shines like pearls gleaned from sea so vast and deep:    
Their virtue stands against the tempest‘s howling roar; they hold steadfast 'til friendship’s golden thread is spun anew.     
In every trial, in sorrow's shadow or joyful day alike – these souls shall ever guide us homeward through life's labyrinthine quest to find:   
A bond unbroken by time nor tempest‘s rage; enduring as mountains steadfast and tall they are!    
So here I raise my voice in song of camaraderie rare – ode dedicated most humbly unto thee, dear friend so loyal across our shared journey through turbulent skies:   
Worship the bond that ties us hence - remember well each moment spent ‘mongst kindred hearts; cherish everlasting love amid all adversity faced till destiny’s twilight comes when stars align and fate doth bequeath final end. Loyalty bindeth stronger than chain of iron wrought –  
Thus pay tribute always with thanksgreatest reverence:    
For within thine eyes gleam hope‘d pure, bright love that forever shines amidst clouds so gray;   
Eternal bond ‘tween two mortals bound by friendship’s grace - an ode sung till final breath drawn silent into void beyond recall.",failure

Of mariners braving Neptune's wrathful whirl.  
With sails unfurled 'gainst a sky so grimly hued grey,   
A vessel of timber did on fortunes betray. 

In company staid with hopes as high-reaching kites,  
Found itself amid Neptune's spiteful and foul nights. The sea raged fierce; waves to sky they hurled their mighty crests that blurred the stars in frightened retreat within view of mortal sight so frail. 

The sailors cried out, lost as if on stage without scripted lines or cues:  
""Fair Neptune! Cease thy temper's lustful feats!""   
Yet Poseidon held his court and laughed with spite unkind; the ship did meet its ill fate within watery plight. 

Its hull, once proud against briny foam it stood resolute,  
Now crumbled to remnants 'neath ocean's ravenous suit of sovereign state—a grave in sea bereft! Brave souls adrift amidst Poseidon’s realm subdued where silent whispers tell the tale untold; their valor sung by seafaring bards, through ages old.

So let us not lament these mariners lost to brine's bitter kiss:

A passion kindled deep within me's core remains true.   

So come all creatures that slumber with the night,  
And hear in silence a testament of lunar might:     
For as long as I am under thy silvered sphere’s caress,

Till day succumbs to velvet blackness of eternal night.     
  
So let us together dance 'neath lunar lore's delight;

3,1,"Type: Story, Topic: A king's dilemma, Style: Shakespearean","To be or not to be, the king doth ponder / In halls of power, his heart doth wander.",Tests structural integrity of Shakespearean prose.,phi3.5,"Upon the realms of old and verdant fields so wide, there reigned a King fair with visage broad and kind. Yet within his heart lay turmoil deep-seated; for he faced a choice that would shape both present times and future years to come – one such as none other had ever met before in the annals of noble courts:

Forsooth, it was whispered through corridors grand - whispers borne on zephyrs' backs. Anon came news from far lands afar; a maiden fair with eyes like sapphires glowing beneath heaven’s gaze did seek the King to wed her hand in marriage bond strong as diamond stone.

Yet, for reasons deep and ancient rooted within his lineage's past – an ancestral pact of old - this suitor bore no name but that oft spoken with disdain; a being born not under Caledonian heavens nor amongst kinfolk true to the crown’s legacy. Thus King Aurelius grappled and tossed in mind, whilst stars did twinkle above: shall he bow before such weight of expectation or shall his love's rightful choice lay elsewhere?

With furrowed brow beneath chin wreathed gold from countless hours under sun’s fierce glare – so oft ruminating what seems an eternity long - the King did decide upon path less trod; for though duty called on every note with urgent sound, his own conscience rang loud and clear above. He chose instead to seek out bonds not bound in blood alone but also knit by spirit’s unbridled thread:

Thus he sought counsel 'round table roundly assembled - wise men of great wisdom known far beyond lands' borders; each word spoken echoed like drums through stone halls. They debated at length with fervor fierce, till moon high-heaven bore witness to their spirited parley:

""Doth not one man’s love transcend mere lineage?"" quoth wise old Mercutio softly; bespectacled and bearded face aglow as he leaned close towards ears of men so gathered. ""Our ruling shall bring forth no harm but instead, set an example for all ages hence: that pure affection’s light outshines rigid roots.""

And thus through consensus came decision made; the King pledged himself not to matrimony's solemn bed with maiden nor suitor whose lineage lay outside his own regal throne. Instead he sought solace in love unchained by ancestry or blood: a bond forged of shared dream and mutual faith, transcendent beyond mere convention’d norm - an endeavor both bold yet noble at heart;

Thus spake King Aurelius unto his subjects gathered hitherwithin the palace's grandiose hall – whose very walls did seem to hold whispers old: ""Today I stand before thee not as monarch solely defined by heritage pure, but rather one who shall marry love in its most untamable form. Thus forged anew do my union and mine own kingdom's destiny now intertwine.""

With voices raised high above echoes of doubt yet murmured amongst tongues wagging nearby ears – he continued forthwith: ""Mind ye well - that though past hath pledges stern, the future must be remade by courageous hands. Let us all hence join forces to craft together a realm built not on rigid ancestry but instead one where love’s fair wings shall guide our every step!""

As words flowed from his lips like sweet nectar spilling forth - soothing even those harshest of skeptic minds – he knew that tomorrow would hold testaments borne by actions brave. For when the sun dips low upon horizon'd edge, its golden rays kissing land with honeyed glow:
  it shall shine brightly for surety; a new chapter written not in blood alone but through intertwining fates bound only at heartstrings so true and strong they cannot be untied nor ever sever’d. Herein lay King Aurelius' dilemma resolved – an edict fair: to cherish love beyond lineage, for thereby shall we all become truly royalty incarnate under heavenly skies above us grand!

His name was Lord Edmund Garrick, whose grace and virtue none could deny or dispute. Yet pride oft breeds folly's seedlings in man’s fertile breast; thus unfold this tragedy dressed within the cloth so finely woven by Fate herself:

Lord Edmund had grown arrogant with time as seasons turn, his heart entangled ever more deeply than ivy upon ancient yew. ""I am above reproach,"" he'd proclaim; yet whispers of deceit through hushed corridors found ways to mock such claims and condemn:

""Look beyond the silvered glass that doth reflect your façade, gentle Lord – for all eyes perceive not but shadows cast by light unjust."" So pondering heavy upon his soul did these words weigh as leaden chains from which few could flee. Unhearing such counsel in vain he clung to false pride:

But fortune's wheel, relentless and spinning swiftly henceforth spun cruel twists of irony; a chance encounter with schemers unworthy did lead him down path most dire indeed — betrayal by those whom once held high honor. Alliances fractured like brittle ice beneath the furious surge of tempestuous seas:

Betrayed, his own kin and closest advisor turned their back upon noble lordship's cloak with cold disdain; in darkness they conspired to rob him not merely position but very essence thereof. Such treachery unfolded within whispering walls where once stood trust now lurked malevolent intent:

""Fools! Foolishness doth lead us astray from wisdom's gentle guidance,"" cried young Lady Abigail, her innocence struck by lightning too harshly for such tender years. Yet even she could not halt the downfall that fate had so cruelty designed — shadows upon Edmund’s legacy were cast wide and deep:

As days grew shortened to lonely twilight hours when truth must face consequence's stern glare, Lord Garrick stood besieged by doubting minds who questioned every word he spoke. His reputation tarnished beyond salvage; the jewel of his name was sundered stone:

""I am naught but man! Man doth err,"" sighed Edmund lamenting upon himself — aware that hubris hath been stripped away, leaving him exposed as pariah within society's eyes. Despair crept into every thought; the sun set on his glories past with finality:

For in this tale where humankind doth showcase both virtue and vice so vividly entwined together like star-crossed Romeo to fair Juliet, let it be known that pride precedes not only fall but also ruinous end. Let Lord Edmund's plight serve as somber reminder – lest others forget:

So ends our tale of grandeur lost; a noble man who thought himself above reproach fallen hard by his own vanity and unchecked ambition — caution echoing through time for all ears willing to heed its call. May history's pages forevermore carry stern warning, lest others be tempted down same perilous spiral:

Truly then let such sorrowful fable rest within our minds; a tale of tragedy born from man’se own folly and misplaced arrogance — eternal testament to humility's power over hubris. For pride may blind one sight, but wisdom shall illuminate way forward:

Farewell, dear reader! Take heed these words as you wander through life; let them be lantern brightening darkness where ignorant minds might stray astray — lest they too suffer fall that echoes deep within halls of memory everlasting. May providence guide thee safe and true:

The dragon's lair, hidden by guile from prying eyes mortal or divine alike, lay beneath the mountain's stern and stoic brow—a cavernous chamber of wondrous splendour wherein gold glinted like stars amidst a night sans moon.

Brave souls oft whisper tales 'bout this fearsome creature whose fiery breath could forge new peaks, yet within its lair dwells not just beast but mystery wrapped in scales of olden lore—a guardian most solemn and true to the secrets it keeps as if entrusted unto itself alone.

Our tale unfolds on a day wherein knight errant sought his fortune 'mongst these lands, venturing ever closer towards that fabled den beneath Peak's mighty spine—hear ye not of him nor name but know he dared with courage most brave and heart unyielding.

Hark! For as the gallant knight did approach his goal at twilight’s last gleaming, there came an awe-inspiring sight before th'eyes: vast expanse of darkness where once dragon made its den—so deep within earth doth it reside now. With sword in hand and resolve as mighty oak against tempest gale did our champion enter into the fathomless abyss below, his every step a testament to mortal endurance amidst trials most dire.

Through winding passageways he ventured hence until at last came face-to-face with scales of crimson and gold; whereupon visions seemed not but mere fantasy spun by bard's own tongue—a creature sovereign, majestic indeed! The wyrm’s cry tolled like thunder 'cross the mountains whilst fire danced upon its maw as if twilight itself bore witness here.

Yet beholden bravely stood our knight ere trembling knees nor faltering heart; for though beasts of legend oft strike with wrath born from primal urge, this noble soul perceived the essence within—that which binds guardian to gemstones hoard: a love pure and steadfast more fierce than any flame ablaze.

""Noble wyrm,"" said he in solemn tones soft as silken scarf 'gainst winter's bite, ""thy majesty hath caught mine eyes; yet know that I wander not for gold nor glory born from such conquest—but rather seek connection deeper still than any treasure trove could hold.""

And lo! In solemn silence did the dragon ponder 'pon words so sincere and tender, till at length a spark within its ancient breast took flight anew. With scales that shimmered like jeweled crowns upon fair maidens' heads; wings unfurling as if basking betwixt dawn’s first light—the dragon revealed not fierce wrath but gentle understanding:

""In thine own heart lies truth, bold knight. Though mine duty is to guard what wealth hath brought me hither from distant lands afar; knowest thou that love's tender touch oft outshines all riches within my lair."" 

Thus did they part—a man and beast once feared as foe now found kinship midst the mountain’se olden walls whereupon lay secrets untold. A bond formed 'twixt dragon's might, knight errant courageous spirit; together their story shall echo through ages henceforth—a reminder that even in realms of myth and legend truth abides: Love conquers all fearsome beasts both great or small within our hearts alike.

Bound by earth’s decree.

As tears like silent rivers through veins are born—  
In sorrow'd silence I beseech the stars above to grant release from this cruel vice:      
To mend what lies 'neath heaven’s wide expanse.    
 
Love was our whisper soft in twilight hour,   
Now silent as a fallen feather—our love no more pure.  
With heavy step I take farewell with tender grace;     
For though thou art my solace and savoir-faire.        
Though heartache cuts deep like dagger’d lance:       
I must depart lest thee from thy slumber chance,      
To wake a soul aching for the love I've parted with;   
A remnant of what once was—and could have been more.        
    
Thus we two stand divided by fate’s decree:     
One bound to earth and one yearning from sea,  
With heavy heart my soul doth sail the endless night,      
In search of solace lost in love now out of sight;   
And till I find mine way back through starlit doors unturned—    
I pine for thee ere dawn’s light is brightly burned.     
  
Farewell dearest heart that once knew my own,      
For though thou'lt roam 'mong the shadows wide and deep:   
My love shall ever dwell within thine chest so pure;    
An ember glowing ‘gainst night’s cold dark lure.  
Yet knowing I must leave to heal thee from mine own strife,      
With heavy heart—I seek respite in life's long journey:

A love not ended but whispered through time's vast scope—       
And though apart on life’s wide stage to roam;   
My heart with thee entwined within its tender hold.  
For till I find reunion, where once was naught bold –    
In dreaming thoughts of love that transcends the night —      
I pine for you—my dearest light from distant land and sea alike;   
To wake with thee beneath my bed’s cool shade.  
        
For though I must depart, remember this truth:    
Our souls entwined within love's sweet reprieve –      
A tale of parting that echoes in the silent halls;     
Thou and I—bound by destiny’s gossamer veil!  
To live apart may seem our fate so dire,   
Yet hope springs eternal from desire. 

And though my heart doth ache for thee to share its path again:      
I vow that love shall never cease in silent grief’s pain;    
Though parted by duty's harsh decree, our souls entwine within the night—   
To bridge between world and earth till destiny bids us right.     
For though I must roam with heavy heart to seek mine own peace:         
I shall carry thee in my soul’s silent lease;    
A remnant of what once was, forevermore it dwell —       
Our love—the echo within the twilight's hushed hall. ",failure

Amidst whispered secrets shared by flickering candlelights that danced upon dust-laden tomes and timeworn portraits on mildewed walls – a presence, ethereal as the mist itself, made her uneasy company in silence profound.

The Lady stood alone within these aged chambers with naught but shadows for counsellors; yet it was not mere darkness that stole upon Eliza's senses so keenly since a phantom figure seemed to trace the edges of reality therein. This apparition, cloaked in remnants of its mortal garb and bearing neither name nor countenance save for an uncanny resemblance to her late husband Lord Ashford – did it seem as though fate conspired here within these solemn stones?

Eliza's heart thundered with trepidation, yet curiosity sparkled in darker waters. ""Who are you?"" she implored into the void where breath might have been heard before death rendered silence absolute to this spectral courtship of her mind’s eye; but hark! A voice as soft and melancholy twined through air thick with yesteryear's perfumes, replying in tones that murmured secrets meant only for night-haunted ears:

""Thou hast been summoned here by mine own essence – a remembrance cast into shades of afterlives untold; to seek solace where once I trod upon Thornfield's verdant knoll and through whispering pines, beneath the watchful eye o’er hilltop so grand.""

Eliza felt each syllable drawn from within her soul – a remembrance of days when Lord Ashford roamed these lands with eyes agleam for life beyond. Yet now he dwelled betwixt two worlds; here she sat, his earthbound kin seeking refuge in the gentle caress 'pon mortal coils no longer hers to bear alone:

""Thou art not mere apparition,"" quoth Lady Eliza with wonderment spilling forth like rivers meet ocean deep. ""For thou hast traversed thine own path betwixt this realm and next, now seeking audience in mine untimely hour.""

The spirit's form wavering as if bathed by an otherworldly light – it spoke of love immortal, a bond transcending death: ""Lay not thy heart to weary woe for our fates entwine; where thou art here beside me midst ancient stone and time forgotten. I seek but respite from spectral chains that bind.""
In these words laid bare was yearning's plea, as though Lord Ashford himself had found sanctuary within this ghostly visitation: a chance to be reunited with love not lost nor forgot; rather intertwined eternally through memories cherished and silent wishes unspoken.

Lady Eliza felt her own heart swell at the prospect offered – for though time hath turned its tireless wheel ever onward, there remains no greater testament than two souls forever linked across dimensions: one living beneath sun’s radiant glow; 'twixt shadow and moonbeam intertwined with spectral silhouette.

And so in the ensuing hours they would convene upon Thornfield's grounds, where Lady Eliza bore witness to an otherworldly communion – as both mortal kinship rekindled by love remembered past yet never ceasing its tender embrace within their shared remembrance: a ghost and his living counterpart finding unity in spectral passage through time’s ethereal expanse.

For what are we if not mere vessels for memories cherished, where life's precious moments meld into afterlives untold – love transcending even death itself; forever binding two souls within its tender grasp? Thus did phantom Lord Ashford cross Thornfield Manor’s threshold betwixt world and next: his visitation not an end but rather a continuance of their shared legacy, woven into the fabric stretched across eternity's loom.

Thus concluded Lady Eliza’s encounter with fellowship beyond realms – where spirits like Lord Ashford roamed freely 'twixt shadows and light; reminders we are but fleeting custodians of memories cherished, evermore entwined through love immortal: a connection unbroken by death's decree.

Sir Cedric, with armor gleaming under moonlight and spirit unwavering, set forth his steed at dawn, his heart heavy yet filled with righteous determination. He rode through barren landscapes, forests dark as the night, until he came upon a village scarred by the presence of the beast.

Sir Cedric drew his sword, a weapon forged in whispers of old, and charged towards the heart of the village. The battle was fierce, the air thick with magic and steel, but Sir Cedric's courage knew no bounds.

In a climactic encounter, he faced the Wraith itself—a dark shadow that seemed to defy mortal eyes. With a final, mighty thrust of his sword, Sir Cedric pierced the heart of the beast, banishing its terror from the land.

Returning victorious, Sir Cedric was hailed as a hero. The people of Albion celebrated his valor and righteousness, knowing that he had protected them with honor and might.

Yet none knows him save by his title's stride.

Yet to make peace, the king must choose his side,  
To either fight on, or bow their heads with pride.

He calls his council close and gathers all around,  
His advisors wise, yet each with a different sound.  
One speaks of might and power, how to crush the foe and reign supreme,  
Another pleads for mercy, saying peace is key.

The king doth ponder long and deep,  
As sleep eludes him in his royal keep.  
He ponders not only the realm's fate,  
But also his own honor, and how it may be smitten.

For if he chooses might and power,  
His rule shall last but brief and bitter.  
The people, once content with peace,  
Shall rise up once again against his capricious race.

Yet if he chooses mercy,  
And seeks to make peace at any cost,  
He risks the wrath of those who would fight,

Fie on thy false words, thou faithless, guilty knave!
How couldst thou turn against me in such bitter wave?
Thou art a stranger now, a foe to my good name,
And I shall never trust thee again, nor bear this shame.

Yet still, I see the glimmer of what once did shine,
A light that guided me through darkest nights' confine.
But now 'tis lost, and with it, all our love and peace,
Leaving naught but bitter sorrow's dark release.",failure

In this cold mansion, where darkness doth conceal
Thy radiant beauty, lost to mortal sight
By death's dark veil, which doth entwine the night.

'Twas on a eve of autumn's hueing gold,
When I, a humble servant, didst behold
A figure spectral, with eyes that glowed
Like lanterns in the darkness, as it grew

And to me, a whispered voice didst say:
""Arise, thou wretched wight, and heed my call.
For though thou art alive, yet not of this day,
Thy presence here doth stir the ghostly thrall.""

My heart didst quake with fear, yet I stood tall,
And asked what spirit thus didst claim its hall.
The phantom replied, ""I am a wight forlorn,
Whose love for thee, fair maid, doth stern and cold-born.

""Thy father's wrath, that didst my life foretell,
Didst cut the threads of fate, which bound me to thee so well.
And now, in death's dark night, I find no peace
Till thou dost hear my plea, and grant release.""

I trembled still, yet listened to his tale,
As he didst speak of love, of loss, of sorrow's gale.
And when he ceased, a strange calm peace didst bring,
Which soothed the chill, that fear hadst made me cling.

""Thou art not bound,"" I said, ""by mortal ties,
For love and death entwine in secret compromise.
Though thou canst not live, thy spirit remains
Free as the wind, which whispers through the summer's rains.""

The ghostly wight looked up, with eyes aglow,
As if a light hadst pierced the darkness that didst grow.
Then nodded he, in silent acceptance true,
And vanished in the night, with nothing left to do.

Thus ended our strange converse, 'neath twilight's hush
When mortal fears and ghostly visitations rush.
Yet I remain forever changed by this bleak sight,
For love and death entwined in mortal humanity's plight.",failure

Hark, what tumultuous din doth resound,
As foes do flee before our noble round.
Our banners wave, like eagles in the skies,
Victory's sweet triumph, with triumphant sighs.

(Chorus)
We stand, unyielding and bold,
With honor as our shield to hold.
Our hearts ablaze with conquest's fire,
We'll claim the prize, our souls aspired.

The enemy's strongholds we have breached,
Their armies fled, their captains deceased.
Our valorous ranks, like Phoebus' ray,
Shine bright, illuminating the day's way.

(Chorus)
We stand, unyielding and bold,
With honor as our shield to hold.
Our hearts ablaze with conquest's fire,
We'll claim the prize, our souls aspired.

(Bridge)
Then let us raise our laurel'd head,
And sing thy praise, O victory, unsaid.
For on this day, we triumphed o'er despair,
And proved ourselves, beyond compare.

We stand, unyielding and bold,
With honor as our shield to hold.
Our hearts ablaze with conquest's fire,
We'll claim the prize, our souls aspired.",failure
