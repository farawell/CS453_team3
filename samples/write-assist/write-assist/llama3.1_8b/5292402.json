Here's a tale of woe,\nA king's dilemma, in a style most true.\n\n'Twas King Henry, with a heart full of gold,\nWho found himself beset by troubles untold.\nHis treasured daughter, fairest Emily, did plight\nHer troth to thee, Sir Edward, with all her might.\n\nBut lo! The king doth learn, with heavy heart,\nThat thou, Sir Edward, art not of noble birth or art.\nThy family's name, a humble one, doth bear\nNo honor, no title, nor any care.\n\nThe king, in sooth, doth wrestle with his mind,\nTorn 'twixt his love for thee and nobility's design.\nShall he allow his dear daughter to marry thee?\nOr shall he choose another suitor, of higher degree?\n\nThus, the king's dilemma doth vex him day and night,\nA decision most difficult, a weight most great and bright.\nHe paces in his chambers, lost in thought and woe,\nUntil at last, he finds a way to make it so.\n\nAnd thus, fair reader, we leave thee to thy fate,\nKing Henry's tale, a story of love, honor, and delicate state."
