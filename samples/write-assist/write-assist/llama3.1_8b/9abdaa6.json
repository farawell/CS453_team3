  "output": "In sooth, fair reader, gather 'round and heed my tale,\nOf a most wondrous place, where terror doth prevail.\n'Tis the lair of yonder dragon, grim and grand,\nA cavernous abode, beset by treacherous land.\n\nDeep within the mountains, where darkness doth reign,\nThis beastly den hath been, for ages past, in vain,\nConcealed from mortal eyes, 'til now thou seest it here.\nAs if from very earth itself, this cave didst appear.\n\nThe entrance wide and gaping, like a maw of old,\nDidst beckon brave adventurers to dare the unknown fold,\nAnd in they went, with hearts full of hope and cheer,\nTheir spirits ready for battle, to dry their fear.\n\nWithin this lair, 'twas dark and damp as night,\nYet lighted by the dragon's fire, that blazed like fiery light.\nA great beast lay in wait, its eyes aglow like mine,\nAs if it couldst see through walls of stone, and read each one's valiant sign.\n\nThe air was thick with magic, heavy as a weight,\nThat made thee feel thy presence here, at once most fraught and elate.\nYet still the bravest knights didst venture in to explore this place,\nAnd face their deepest fears, with hearts that beat like steady pace.\n\nBut few returned from thence, back to tell the tale of woe,\nFor none who dared enter, ever escaped unscathed, 'tis so.\nTheir valor in their hearts, didst slowly turn to fear,\nAs they beheld the dragon's lair, and trembled with great peer.\n\nThen thus I bid thee, mortal reader, if thou seekest thrills,\nAvoid this dreaded place, where none but death doth dwell.\nFor though it be a test of courage, 'tis not worth thy life,\nTo wander into yonder darkness, and meet thy doom in strife."
