  "output": "Thou seekest a ditty, dost thou? A song to praise the beauty of autumn's fade?\nVery well, I shall compose a verse, in style most fine and made.\n\n**Autumn's Wistful Hymn**\n\n(to a gentle tune on lute or harp)\n\nVerse 1:\nWhenas the leaves do wither, and the winds do sigh,\nAnd golden hues upon the trees do lie,\nThou art a season of beauty, fleeting still,\nA final dance of nature, ere the winter's chill.\n\nChorus:\nOh, autumn's beauty, thou dost shine so bright,\nIn tints of amber, copper, and the twilight's light.\nYet, in thy ephemerality, we find a peaceful sight,\nA bittersweet reminder of life's fragile, flickering might.\n\nVerse 2:\nThe trees, like sentinels of old, stand tall and gray,\nTheir branches creaking softly, in the autumn's whisper'd sway.\nThe earth, a canvas, painted with hues of red and gold,\nDoth tell the tale of harvests past, and stories yet untold.\n\nChorus:\nOh, autumn's beauty, thou dost shine so bright,\nIn tints of amber, copper, and the twilight's light.\nYet, in thy ephemerality, we find a peaceful sight,\nA bittersweet reminder of life's fragile, flickering might.\n\n**The End**\n\nThus, I hope this ditty meets with thy approbation. May it bring joy and wonder to all who hear it, and may the beauty of autumn remain forever in their hearts."
