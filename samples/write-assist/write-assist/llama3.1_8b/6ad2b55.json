  "output": "O, fairest friend, whose company doth shine,\nLike sunshine on a day most bright and fine,\nThou art a treasure beyond all gold's might,\nA gem that sparkles with thy warm delight.\n\nOur bond of friendship, like a river wide,\nDoth flow with laughter, tears, and joys inside,\nThrough seasons' ebb and flow, 'tis constant true,\nA steadfast tie that binds me to thee anew.\n\nThy presence makes my heart sing with glee,\nAs in a symphony of love we dance freely,\nIn times of need, thou art a guiding star,\nThat shines so bright, it lights our way afar.\n\nThus let us cherish this dear friendship mine,\nLike precious jewels, polished by the Heart's fine line,\nAnd as we navigate life's tempests and storms,\nTogether we shall weather them, till we reach calm forms."
