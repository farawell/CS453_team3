  "output": "O, fairest friend, whose trust I once did hold,\nHow dearly now thy treachery doth unfold!\nA deed most foul, a heart of darkest night,\nHath brought thee to this pass, and lost thy light.\n\nThy promise broken, like a shattered spell,\nDidst prove thy empty words, a hollow shell.\nThe whispers in mine ear, a traitor's art,\nDidst weave a web of deceit, and capture my heart.\n\nA pox upon thy face, thou wretched one!\nMay scorn and shame forever be thine own.\nFor when thou didst forsake me, like a winter's breeze,\nThou left'st me to the winds of bitter ease.\n\nThus let this lesson serve thee, as a mirror's gleam,\nReflecting back at thee thy treacherous scheme.\nAnd when thou seest thy path, all lit with guile and spite,\nMay Fortune's wheel turn hard against thy night."
