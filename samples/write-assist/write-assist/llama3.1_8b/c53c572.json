  "output": "Fair listener, gather 'round and heed my tale,\nOf Sir Valoric, a knight of noble tale.\n'Twas said his quest began with dawn's first light,\nTo vanquish the dark dragon, terrorizing the night.\n\nIn lands afar, where sun doth rarely shine,\nThe beast didst hold sway, with dreadful design.\nSir Valoric, with armor shining bright,\nDidst saddle forth, his steed of noble might.\n\nHis heart afire, with chivalry's pure flame,\nHe rode through forests dark, and over mountains' name.\nThrough villages poor, where peasants prayed for peace,\nHe journeyed on, with purpose, unrelenting and release.\n\nAt last, the dragon lay before him, fierce and grim,\nBreathing fire that didst light up all within the brim.\nSir Valoric drew his sword, with valor in his heart,\nAnd challenged the beast, \"Arise, thou monster, we shall never part!\"\n\nThe battle raged, with steel on scale so bright,\nEach blow a thunderclap, that shook the morning light.\nYet still Sir Valoric fought, till dragon's scales didst break,\nAnd from its depths, a maiden fair didst emerge, for his sake.\n\nThus ended the quest, of noble heart and might,\nSir Valoric returned, to kingdom's warm delight.\nHis honor won, with love and glory in his eyes,\nHe lived on, forevermore, as legend whispers by."
