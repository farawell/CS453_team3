  "output": "Fair listener, thou dost crave a verse,\nTo tell the tale of Nature's ire and curse.\n'Tis thus:\n\nWhen tempests rage and thunder doth roar,\nAnd lightnin' flasheth from darkened shore,\nThe world is beset by furious might,\nAs Nature's wrath doth let its fury take flight.\n\nThe winds, they howl with mournful, wailing sound,\nAs trees uprooted lie, their limbs o'erthrown around.\nThe rivers swell and overflow their banks,\nAnd with each wave, the earth doth feel its stings.\n\nThe skies, once clear, now hide in dark despair,\nAs sunbeams flee before the storm's rough air.\nAnd thou, poor mortal, dost thy safety seek,\nYet still, thou art not safe from Nature's shriek.\n\nFor when it rageth on, no man can stand,\nAgainst its fury, nor escape its hand.\nThen tremble not, but yet beware and know,\nThat Nature's wrath is a force that none may show."
