Here's a ditty in the style of the Bard himself:\n\n**\"Ode to Chivalry\"**\n\n(Verse 1)\nHark, what noble virtue doth thou bring?\nA code of honor, and a heart that singeth.\nThy valor is renowned, thy courtesy true,\nIn battle's heat, or quiet halls, 'tis shown anew.\n\n(Chorus)\nOh, chivalry, oh chivalry, thy virtues I adore!\nA shield to defend the weak, a heart that asks no more.\nThou dost uphold the innocent, and vanquish evil's might,\nForever in my esteem, a shining light.\n\n(Verse 2)\nWhen ladies fair, with beauty's radiant glow,\nDo pass by thee, thou dost uncover thy head, as is thy vow.\nIn courtesy, thou art unmatched, a knight of noble birth,\nWith honor guiding thee, on this terrestrial earth.\n\n(Chorus)\nOh, chivalry, oh chivalry, thy virtues I adore!\nA shield to defend the weak, a heart that asks no more.\nThou dost uphold the innocent, and vanquish evil's might,\nForever in my esteem, a shining light.\n\n(Bridge)\nThough times may change, and valor be tried,\nThy code remains unchanged, like constellations in the sky.\nA beacon of hope, for all to see,\nChivalry, thy virtues shall forever be free!\n\n(Chorus)\nOh, chivalry, oh chivalry, thy virtues I adore!\nA shield to defend the weak, a heart that asks no more.\nThou dost uphold the innocent, and vanquish evil's might,\nForever in my esteem, a shining light.\n\nMay this song, in Shakespearean style, pay homage to the noble virtue of Chivalry!"
