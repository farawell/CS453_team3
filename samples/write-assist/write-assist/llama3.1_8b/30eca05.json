  "output": "Fairest of loves, thou art gone from me,\nAnd with thy departure, sorrow's sting doth see.\nOur love, a flame that once did brightly shine,\nHath dwindled to an ember, now but faintly mine.\n\nThy lips, so sweet and gentle as the spring,\nNow lie in silence, devoid of tender ring.\nThe whispers thou wouldst share in secret ear,\nAre now but echoes, lost beyond recall and fear.\n\nAlas, my heart doth beat with sorrow's pain,\nAs I behold the emptiness that thou hast gained.\nFor thou, my love, hast flown to distant skies,\nLeaving naught but memories of sweet, bygone sighs.\n\nYet still, I hold on to yesteryear's delight,\nWhen love didst make our hearts dance through the night.\nThough now 'tis naught but memory, a ghostly refrain,\nI'll cherish thee, my love, in love's lost, heart-wrenching pain."
