  "output": "Fairest love, thou dost depart from mine,\nAnd with thy leave, a heavy heart doth mine.\n'Tis hard to bid thee adieu, and say,\n\"Go forth, my love, and trouble me not another day.\"\n\nThe thought of thee, in distant lands doth stay,\nDoth bring a pang to mine affectionate breast.\nI shall miss thee, dear one, with each passing ray\nOf sunshine, which shall shine without thy gentle nest.\n\nBut soft, what light through yonder window breaks?\n'Tis only memory, that whispers our sweet makes.\nYet still I'll hold on to the love we shared,\nAnd in my heart, thy lovely form be spared.\n\nFarewell, my love, may fortune smile upon thee,\nAnd when thou art gone, may mine thoughts be free\nTo roam with thine."
