  "output": "O, fair reader, thou seekest a tale of woe,\nOf seas and ships, where fate doth play its role.\nA story of a vessel lost to the deep,\nWhere sailors and passengers in terror did creep.\n\n'Twas midsummer's eve when I set forth to sea,\nMy heart full of hope, with adventures to be.\nOur ship, the \"Maverick's Pride\", was sturdy and strong,\nWith sails of white and hull of oak, where brave men did belong.\n\nThe winds were calm, the seas were blue and bright,\nAs we sailed westward, towards the sunset's delight.\nBut soft, what carelessness! What reckless abandon!\nFor lo, a storm arose, with thunder's mighty clamour!\n\nWaves crashed against our ship, like mighty fists,\nAnd I, a lowly sailor, did feel my heart in disarray's twists.\nOur captain brave, yet fraught with mortal fear,\nDid cry out to the heavens, \"Save us, O Lord, we pray!\".\n\nAlas! 'Twas not to be. The storm raged on and on,\nUntil our ship, like a bird fallen from its nest,\nStruck rock and splintered, leaving naught but ruin's throne.\nThe survivors, soaked with seawater and cold despair,\nDid cling to wreckage, as if 'twere their final prayer.\n\nAnd I, poor wretch, did find myself alone,\nAdrift on the ocean, where nary a soul was known.\nMy heart, like a tempest-tossed leaf, did toss and spin,\nAs I cried out for help, but none came to save me within.\n\nThus, fate had dealt its cruel hand, and I did succumb\nTo the waves' cruel mercy. The Maverick's Pride, lost at sea,\nLeaves naught but memories of happier days gone by.\nYet still I hold on fast to hope's thin thread, that guides my way."
