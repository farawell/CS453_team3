But know thou shalt behold me 'gain.\nFor on this eve, when moonlight doth illume the night,\nOur paths shall cross again, in all thy waking light.\"\n\nAnd thus, fair patron, Emily didst see the ghost no more that night,\nBut feared his return, with a dread that would not take flight.\nFor though he vanished into thin air, as darkness doth descend,\nShe knew she'd face him once again, when next the moon's pale glow should attend.\n\nThus ends this tale of terror and the specter's dire refrain,\nA story told in whispers, 'neath the candle's faint.\nMay it haunt thee not, fair reader, but be thy entertainment true,"
