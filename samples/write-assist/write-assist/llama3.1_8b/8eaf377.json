  "output": "Cruel beauty of the lunar sphere,\nHow thou dost entice with thy silvery glare,\nA midnight reveler, that doth appear,\nTo dance upon the darkness, without a care.\n\nThy gentle beams, like Cupid's whispering sighs,\nDo stir within my heart, a lovesick surprise,\nAs I, a lone wanderer, beneath thy light,\nDo find myself entranced, in pure delight.\n\nOh, moonlit night, thou art a wondrous sight,\nA canvas of black velvet, star-studded bright,\nThy shadows softly falling, like a lover's caress,\nDo make my heart sing sweet melodies of happiness.\n\nThe world, it seemeth, hath paused, in thy pale glow,\nAs if the very stars themselves, were watching low,\nTheir twinkling lights, like diamonds in the sky,\nReflecting off thy surface, with a gentle sigh.\n\nOh, cruel beauty, how thou dost bewitch me still,\nWith thy enchanting presence, on this moonlit hill,\nI am but thine, a captive of thy silvery might,\nA willing prisoner, of thy ethereal light."
