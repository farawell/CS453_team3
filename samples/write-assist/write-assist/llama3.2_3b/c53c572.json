A dragon fierce and old,\nDidst guard the maiden's castle, cold and gray as stone,\nIts scales as black as night, its eyes aglow,\nLike embers of a fire that would not cease to grow.\n\nSir Edward, undaunted by the beast's great might,\nDidst steel himself for battle, with all his will and light,\nHe charged forth, lance in hand, with valor in his heart,\nAnd clashed with the dragon, like two mighty work of art.\n\nThe battle raged, the clash of steel on scale,\nDidst echo through the valleys, like a dire gale,\nBut Sir Edward fought on, undaunted and true,\nTill at last, the beast lay vanquished, its dominion anew.\n\nAnd when he returned to the maiden's side,\nShe gazed upon him, with eyes of love and pride,\n\"O Sir Edward, noble knight,\" she said with a sigh,\n\"How didst thou conquer the dragon, that didst guard me nigh?\"\n\nSir Edward smiled, his heart full of delight,\n\"I conquered fear, and stood up to the fight,\nFor honor and virtue, I didst take my stand,\nAnd saved thee from the beast's cruel hand.\"\n\nThe maiden laughed, a merry sound so bright,\n\"Thou art indeed, a knight most true and right,\"\nAnd Sir Edward knew, his quest was now fulfilled,\nHe had won love's heart, and proved his valor unsealed.\n\nThus ended Sir Edward's noble quest,\nA tale of courage, honor, and the knight's crest,\nMay it be told and retold, in annals of renown,\nFor Sir Edward, a hero true, forever crowned.",
