  "output": "In days of yore, when valorous knights held forth their realm,\nA noble Sir Edward, with a quest, did set his helm.\n'Twas said that in the land of Avalon, a mystic force doth lie,\nA golden cup, forged from the gods' own hand, to heal the land's dark sigh.\n\nThe cup, 'twas whispered, held within it balm divine,\nA remedy for mortal wounds, and hearts forlorn in pain.\nAnd thus Sir Edward, with honor as his guiding star,\nDid set forth on a journey, fraught with peril, near and far.\n\nHe rode through forests dark, where giant trees did stand,\nTheir branches creaking loud, like skeletal fingers of the land.\nHe crossed swift rivers wide, where fish did leap and play,\nAnd climbed steep mountains high, where eagles soared on windy day.\n\nAt last he reached the shores of Avalon's enchanted lake,\nWhere moonbeams danced upon the waves, a silver mist to make.\nA figure stood, with cloak of white, like a spirit of the tide,\nWho spake in whispers low, \"Why hast thou come, Sir Edward, to reside?\"\n\n\"I seek the golden cup,\" he said, with courage in his heart,\n\"To heal the land's dark wounds, and play my part in wisdom's art.\"\nThe figure gazed upon him, with eyes that shone like stars above,\nAnd thus replied, \"Thy quest is noble, Sir Edward, but fraught with endless love.\"\n\n\"Yet still I'll press on,\" he said, with spirit unbroken and true,\n\"For honor calls to me, as my heart doth beat anew.\"\nThe figure nodded on, with a gentle smile, so kind and wise,\n\"Then let us find the cup, in Avalon's mystic surprise.\"\n\nTogether they did search, through trials and through strife,\nThrough ancient ruins old, where legends whispered of yore.\nAt last they reached the heart of Avalon, where sunbeams shone bright,\nAnd there, upon a pedestal, did lie the golden cup, shining light.\n\nSir Edward grasped it tight, with hope in his heart's core,\nTo heal the land, and bring peace to all, forevermore.\nThe figure spoke once more, with voice like music sweet,\n\"May honor guide thee, Sir Edward, as thy heart doth beat.\"\n\nAnd thus he rode back home, with the golden cup in hand,\nA symbol of hope, where darkness had once held its stand.\nHis people rejoiced, as healing balm did flow from above,\nThanks to Sir Edward's quest, and his noble, endless love."
