  "output": "Fairest love, thou must depart,\nLeaving naught but sorrow in my heart.\nThe thought of thee, a bittersweet refrain,\nDoth echo through my mind, a lingering pain.\n\nThy lips, they curve in sweetest smile,\nYet now they part, and I am left to while.\nAway, dear love, may Fortune smile upon thee,\nAnd in thy absence, may my heart be free.\n\nThe memories of our entwined delight,\nDo haunt me thus, like a gentle, sorrowful night.\nI recall the touch of thy soft skin so fair,\nAnd weep, for I shall never feel it there.\n\nFarewell, dear love, may our paths cross again,\nBut till that day, my heart doth remain.\nIn pain and longing, I shall stay and pine,\nFor thee, dear love, my heart's eternal shrine."
