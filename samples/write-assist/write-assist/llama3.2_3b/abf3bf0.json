  "actualOutput": "Fair Verona's halls of grandeur, where once didst stroll a nobleman of might,\nWith fortunes vast and titles shining bright.\nHis name, Lord Edwin, whispered in awe and reverence round,\nA lion-hearted man, with honor as his guiding mound.\n\nBut lo! Fate, in cruelty and wile, didst weave a tapestry of sorrow and despair,\nAs Edwin's star began its precipitous decline, with fortunes lost beyond repair.\nAt first, 'twas naught but whispers, rumors of a curse that didst afflict his line,\nA family curse, born of darkness, that didst slowly seep into the nobleman's shrine.\n\nHis wife, fair Lady Isabella, once as radiant as the morning sun,\nDidst begin to wither, like a flower in winter's chill, her beauty gone.\nTheir sons, those bright and shining stars, didst fade, their futures lost to fate's dark hand,\nLeaving Edwin alone, with naught but sorrow's heavy weight.\n\nHe wandered, lost and forlorn, through streets once familiar and dear,\nA shadow of his former self, with heart as heavy as the stone that didst appear.\nHis wealth, his titles, all didst fade, like phantoms in the night, without a sound,\nAs Edwin's world, once vast and full of promise, crumbled to the ground.\n\nHe searched for answers, night and day, but none could be found,\nA mysterious force, that didst stalk him, with a wicked, wily round.\nHis advisors turned against him, like vipers in his breast,\nTheir whispers poisonous, as they sought to bring him low, and put him to rest.\n\nAnd so, fair Verona's nobleman, Lord Edwin, fell,\nA victim of fate, of fortune's cruel hand, that didst entwine.\nHis story, now a cautionary tale, of pride and hubris told,\nA reminder to the wise, of honor's fragility, like glass, to be held.\n\nYet still, in whispers, rumors live on, of Edwin's final days,\nOf valor unyielding, until death's dark wings didst take their way.\nFor though his star had fallen, his heart remained untainted gold,\nA shining beacon, that will guide us all, through life's darkest night and cold.",
