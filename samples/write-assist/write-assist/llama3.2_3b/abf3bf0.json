Thy honor's lost!\nWhat treason hath thy soul been led to commit?\n\nLORD EDWARD:\nA plague upon my reason! In the darkest night,\nI gave myself up to ambition's all-consuming light.\nAnd now I see that once great edifice of might\nStands crumbling 'neath the weight of my own vice.\n\n(Exeunt)\n\nACT III, Scene III\n\n(Enter LORD EDWARD, in prison)\n\nLORD EDWARD:\nOh, bitter fate! Who saw this coming? who could e'er\nForesee the calamity that I didst precipitate?\nI see now all the paths I took to reach my throne,\nNow lie in ruin. My once-illustrious name is overthrown.\n\n(Enter SIR THOMAS, bearing a solemn expression)\n\nSIR THOMAS:\nMy lord, thy fall is complete. Thy sentence is passed.\nYet even in my sorrow, this lesson holds: pride's heavy chain\nCannot bind the spirit that doth see its error and disdain\nThe light of wisdom.\n\n(Exeunt)\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nThus falls the noble Edward, brought low by his own hand,\nA cautionary tale of how the shadows of ambition can command.\nLet this be lesson to all who would ascend the highest stage:\nBeware the whispers of despair, lest you stumble into ruin's dark page."
