What triumph doth our hearts proclaim,\nWhen weary limbs, and valorous sweat, are gained?\nThe enemy of toil and strife doth flee,\nAs we, unbroken, stand victorious, thou seest me!\n\n**(Chorus)**\nO'er the battlefield of fate, we hold our ground;\nWith honor, courage, and a steadfast crown.\nOur armor shines like sunshine on the day,\nFor we, triumphant warriors, hath our victory won by May.\n\n**(Verse 2)**\nThrough raging storms, and darkness of despair,\nWe stood as pillars, unshaken there.\nFor nobler passions, than fear's cold art,\nDidst drive us forward, straight to triumph's heart!\n\n**(Chorus)**\nO'er the battlefield of fate, we hold our ground;\nWith honor, courage, and a steadfast crown.\nOur armor shines like sunshine on the day,\nFor we, triumphant warriors, hath our victory won by May.\n\n**(Bridge)**\nWhen valor's call didst echo through our breast,\nWe answered loud, with hearts undressed.\nNo coward's fear, nor traitor's sigh,\nCould stay us now, as conquerors, passing by!\n\n**(Verse 3)**\nNow triumph's radiance doth light the night,\nAs we emerge victorious in endless fight.\nOur names etched in annals of renown,\nOur deeds immortal, in history crowned.\n\n**(Chorus)**\nO'er the battlefield of fate, we hold our ground;\nWith honor, courage, and a steadfast crown.\nOur armor shines like sunshine on the day,\nFor we, triumphant warriors, hath our victory won by May!\n\n**(Outro)**\nThen raise thy cup, dear friend, in festive cheer,\nAnd toast to us, who have our triumph clear!\nFor as long as chronicles of old do tell,\nWe stand victorious, in eternal story's spell!"
