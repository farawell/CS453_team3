  "output": "O, fairest virtue, thou dost shine so bright,\nA beacon in the darkness of endless night.\nThy gentle light doth guide me on my way,\nAnd in thy presence, all my worries stray.\n\nThy beauty is not skin-deep, nor a guise,\nFor thou art pure of heart, and free from compromise.\nThou dost resist the temptations of the air,\nAnd dost uphold the highest standards with care.\n\nThy lips, they curve in sweet and modest smile,\n Inviting none to taste the sweetness worthwhile.\nThy eyes, they sparkle like the morning dew,\nReflecting innocence and virtue true blue.\n\nO, lady, thou art a paragon of thy sex,\nA shining star that doth illume each breach\nOf propriety and modesty's stern decree.\nThou dost ascend the ranks of noble ladies be.\n\nYet, thou art not proud, nor haughty, nor cold,\nFor in thine heart, thou dost a love story unfold.\nThou dost give with generosity and with grace,\nAnd in thy kindness, all my humble soul doth find its place."
