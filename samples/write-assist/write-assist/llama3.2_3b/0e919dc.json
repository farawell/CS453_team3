  "actualOutput": "**The Cursed Vessel**\n\nIn sooth, 'twas a night most foul and drear,\nWhen our fair ship, the \"Maverick's Pride\", did appear\nUpon the rocky coast, with nary a warning sign,\nAs if the gods themselves had ordained its demise divine.\n\nOur captain, stout and true, did strive to keep\nThe vessel on course, but fate, it would not reap.\nThe winds howled loud, the waves crashed high and bright,\nAnd our poor ship, in their wild grasp, was torn from sight.\n\nOh, woe is us! Our cries for help did fall\nUpon deaf ears, as if the sea itself did enthrall\nAll sound of mortal men, save our own despairing shout,\nAs we plummeted down, into the dark and icy rout.\n\nThe hull did splinter, the mast did snap and break,\nAnd our brave crew, in terror, their lives' thread did shake.\nI, a lowliest sailor, did cling to what remained,\nA fragment of wood, that floated, as if 'twere life-sustained.\n\nAlas, poor friends! How my heart doth ache with pain,\nAs I behold the wreck, where once our hope did reign.\nThe sea, it seems, hath claimed her own, in cruel delight,\nAnd left us naught but sorrow, and a fatal night.\n\nYet still we cling to fragments of that fateful eve,\nWhen all was lost, and madness reigned, like a dire decree.\nFor though the waves do roar, and our bodies may be worn,\nIn spirit, we remain, with memories of life forlorn.\n\n**Postscript**\n\nThe Maverick's Pride was never seen again,\nHer crew, their lives, lost at sea, in mortal pain.\nYet some say, on stormy nights, when the moon doth hide its face,\nA ghostly ship may sail, with mournful, eerie pace.",
