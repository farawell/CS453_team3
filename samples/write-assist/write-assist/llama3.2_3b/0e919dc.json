The fates, in their dark whispers, did conspire\nAgainst the vessel's safety, and the crew's desire.\nA storm arose, of fierce and wild design,\nWith lightning flashing, thunder booming in its prime.\n\nThe ship, a fragile thing, did buck and roll with might,\nAs waves crashed on its deck, like demons in the night.\nThe crew, in panic's grip, did cling to what they could,\nAs all around them, chaos reigned, and terror stood.\n\nAnd then, the final blow, that seal'd the ship's fate,\nA mountain of rock rose up, an island's savage state.\nThe vessel, helpless now, did dash upon the shore,\nWith cries of anguish, and a sound that will forever roar.\n\nAlas! The crew, in dire distress, did flail and strive,\nTo save their ship, their lives, but all was lost to the tide.\nTheir captain, noble soul, with wounds so deep and sore,\nDid call out for his friends, as death's cold darkness closed the door.\n\nAnd when at last the waves, in silence, did lay still,\nThe survivors stumbled, ashore, on a beach of blood and chill.\nThey gazed upon their wreck, with tears that would not dry,\nAnd mourned the loss, of comrades, who had sailed the sky.\n\nThus let this tale be told, of shipwreck's cruel might,\nA lesson to all sailors, of fate's dark and endless night.\nFor though we navigate seas, of hope and joy and fear,\nWe must not pride ourselves, on our control, so clear.\n\nFarewell, dear listeners! May the winds of fortune blow\nIn favor of your voyages, and may your hearts forever glow.\nBut if thou mustest sail, be wary of the tides that shift,\nAnd know the power, of fate's dark whispers, and its cruel gift."
