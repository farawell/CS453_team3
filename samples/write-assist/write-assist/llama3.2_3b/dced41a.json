  "output": "O, fairest Earth, how oft thy wrath doth show,\nIn tempests fierce and darkness' dismal woe.\nThe skies, they darken, like a mourner's veil,\nAnd thunder booms, as if the heavens frail.\n\nThe winds, they howl and whip the waves to foam,\nAs if in rage, they sought to rend the tomb\nOf Nature's peace, that once did gently reign.\nAnd darkness pours, like blackest night's sweet pain.\n\nO, tempests wild and fierce, what dost thou bring?\nA flood of woes, a deluge of despairing sting?\nThou tramplest all beneath thy wrathful feet,\nLeaving naught but desolation, void of sweet retreat.\n\nYet, in thy fury, I behold a truth profound,\nThat Nature's power, is equal to her might unbound.\nFor though she rage and roar, with elemental fire,\nHer beauty lies, in wildness' untamed desire.\n\nThus let me tremble, at the tempest's roar,\nAnd marvel at the force, that shapes the Earth once more.\nFor though thy wrath, doth darkness bring to my door,\nI know thy power, is tempered by a gentle core."
