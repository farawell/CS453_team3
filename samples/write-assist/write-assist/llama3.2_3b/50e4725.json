  "actualOutput": "Fair and fairest maiden, thou dost dwell\nIn this cold mansion, where darkness doth conceal\nThy radiant beauty, lost to mortal sight\nBy death's dark veil, which doth entwine the night.\n\n'Twas on a eve of autumn's hueing gold,\nWhen I, a humble servant, didst behold\nA figure spectral, with eyes that glowed\nLike lanterns in the darkness, as it grew\n\nAnd to me, a whispered voice didst say:\n\"Arise, thou wretched wight, and heed my call.\nFor though thou art alive, yet not of this day,\nThy presence here doth stir the ghostly thrall.\"\n\nMy heart didst quake with fear, yet I stood tall,\nAnd asked what spirit thus didst claim its hall.\nThe phantom replied, \"I am a wight forlorn,\nWhose love for thee, fair maid, doth stern and cold-born.\n\n\"Thy father's wrath, that didst my life foretell,\nDidst cut the threads of fate, which bound me to thee so well.\nAnd now, in death's dark night, I find no peace\nTill thou dost hear my plea, and grant release.\"\n\nI trembled still, yet listened to his tale,\nAs he didst speak of love, of loss, of sorrow's gale.\nAnd when he ceased, a strange calm peace didst bring,\nWhich soothed the chill, that fear hadst made me cling.\n\n\"Thou art not bound,\" I said, \"by mortal ties,\nFor love and death entwine in secret compromise.\nThough thou canst not live, thy spirit remains\nFree as the wind, which whispers through the summer's rains.\"\n\nThe ghostly wight looked up, with eyes aglow,\nAs if a light hadst pierced the darkness that didst grow.\nThen nodded he, in silent acceptance true,\nAnd vanished in the night, with nothing left to do.\n\nThus ended our strange converse, 'neath twilight's hush\nWhen mortal fears and ghostly visitations rush.\nYet I remain forever changed by this bleak sight,\nFor love and death entwined in mortal humanity's plight.",
