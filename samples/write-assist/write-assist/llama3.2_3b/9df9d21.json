  "output": "O, fairest trust, how swiftly thou dost break,\nLike autumn's leaf that withers, lost from sight.\nThy breach, O friend, doth pierce my heart like stake,\nAnd in its wake, a chasm of despair takes flight.\n\nThy words, once sweet as honeyed nectar's flow,\nNow prove deceitful, and with treachery's woe.\nThe bond we shared, now broken, doth affright,\nAs I behold the shattered fragments of our sight.\n\nO, cruel fate, that hath entwined my trust\nWith thine own duplicity's insidious lust!\nHow couldst thou thus forswear thy sacred vow?\nAnd with such fiendish art, my heart and soul allow?\n\nThe sting of betrayal cuts like winter's night,\nAnd in its darkness, I am lost from sight.\nYet still, I hold thee guilty of this heinous deed,\nFor in thine eyes, a serpent's guile doth proceed.\n\nFarewell, O faithless friend! May fortune turn her wheel\nAgainst thy treacherous deeds, and may thy wickedness reveal."
