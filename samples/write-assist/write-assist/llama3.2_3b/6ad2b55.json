Thou art my sunshine in life's gray veil,\nMy guiding star, that lights the path I wander sail.\nIn thee, I find solace, comfort, and a peaceful nest,\nA haven where my weary soul may take its rest.\n\nSo here's to our dear friendship, strong and true of heart,\nMay it forever flourish, never to depart.\nFor in thy company, I am complete, I say,\nAnd with thee, dear friend, I'll face life's ebb away.",
