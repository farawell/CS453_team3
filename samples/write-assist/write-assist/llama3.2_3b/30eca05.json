  "output": "Fairest love, thou hast departed hence,\nLeaving naught but sorrow and bitter chance.\nThy eyes, like sapphires shining bright and blue,\nNow dimly gleam, as if their light were anew.\n\nMy heart, erst filled with passion's fiery might,\nDoth now lie broken, lost in endless night.\nThe memories of our love, like autumn leaves,\nDo rustle, whispering sweet, bittersweet reprieves.\n\nO, cruel fate, that took thee from my sight,\nLeaving me to pine and wander through this night!\nMy soul, a shipwrecked vessel, lost at sea,\nLongs for the shores of thy loving destiny.\n\nBut alas, dear love, thou art gone, and I\nMust now endure this grief, that doth not die.\nYet still I hold on to hope's faint light,\nA glimmering ember, that guides me through this endless night.\n\nSo let us cherish every fleeting moment we shared,\nFor in thy absence, time itself seemeth impaired.\nAnd though our love hath ended, and thou art gone,\nIn memory, thy beauty shall forever be my song."
