  "output": "In sooth, King Edward didst sit upon his throne,\nWhere weary eyes didst gaze out upon the land.\nA weighty burden boreth upon his heart,\nAs thou, dear friend, must hear the tale unplanned.\n\nTwo nobles come to him with suitors' plea,\nOne beggith for a grant of fertile land,\nTo till and reap, and thus provide for thee,\nHis family's fortune, lost in troubled sand.\nThe other suith for pardon of past wrongs,\nA prisoner most foul, who doth confess\nGuilt in the king's own just and lawful thrones.\n\n\"O gracious lord,\" they say, \"whither dost thou turn?\nWho shall thy mercy favor, or thy wrath burn?\"\nEdward, perplexed, with troubled mind doth ponder,\nTorn 'twixt right justice and his heart's good brother.\nFor if he grants the land to one who is most dear,\nHe risketh famine, discontent, and sorrow here.\n\nYet soft, when at the mercy of a wrongdoer lies\nHis own royal honor, lost in foolish guise,\nHe must deny the plea, lest wicked might,\nDo spread its dark wings o'er his fair kingdom's light.\nAnd thus, O noble friend, thy heart doth ache,\nAs weighed down 'neath conflicting passions he doth partake.\n\nBut as he sits in thought, a whispered voice\nDoth whisper reason, guiding him to make choice.\n\"O king,\" it says, \"thou art not judge nor jury;\nThy will, though wise, shall temper justice's fury.\"\nAnd thus, with careful heart and measured pace,\nHe doth decide the matter, finding space.\n\nFor rather than a peasant's fertile soil\nShould suffer from his royal beneficence' toil,\nAnd risk disaster, famine, and great woe,\nEdward chooth to uphold his noble vow.\nAnd as for pardon of past wrongs, he granteth it freely,\nIn token of the justice that doth freely be.\n\nThe nobles left his presence with their suitors' plea\nUngranted still; but Edward's honor shone bright and free.\nAnd in his heart, a humble lesson didst reside,\nThat mercy temper'd justice is the wisest guide."
