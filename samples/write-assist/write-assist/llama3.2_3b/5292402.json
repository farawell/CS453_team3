  "actualOutput": "In sooth, a king's great weight didst press upon his brow,\nA burden born of power and royal vow.\nHis people's fate, 'twas in his hands to hold,\nYet, like a tempest-tossed sea, their happiness doth unfold.\n\nKing Edward, just and fair, yet wise beyond his years,\nDidst face a test of conscience that didst bring him tears.\nA messenger from foreign climes didst come to shore,\nWith tidings dire: his people's kin, in war's dark hour.\n\nThe neighboring prince, a ruthless foe, didst wage\nA campaign of conquest, leaving death and woe to rage.\nThe king's own brother, noble and true of heart,\nDidst fall in battle, torn asunder by the enemy's art.\n\nNow, Edward's people cried out for his aid,\nTheir kinship with theirs, in blood and bone displayed.\nYet, weary of the wars that had long plagued their land,\nAnd worn by grief and sorrow's heavy hand,\n\nThe king didst weigh the cost of taking up the sword,\nLest innocent lives fall, like autumn leaves, to be implored.\nForsooth, he knew not which path to choose or flee,\nTorn 'twixt duty, honor, and the well-being of his people's plea.\n\n\"O woe is me!\" he cried, in anguish and despair,\n\"What sorrow shall my reign bring forth, beyond compare?\nShall I, a king, for love and kinship take the field?\nOr shall I sit in power, and watch as death doth yield?\"\n\nThe queen, with gentle voice and soothing balm, didst speak\n\"Dear husband, thy heart is heavy, weigh not what others seek.\nThink of our people's welfare, their safety and their peace,\nForsooth, 'tis more than gold or glory that they most need to release.\"\n\nKing Edward pondered on her words, like a lost sheep in the night,\nSeeking guidance from the stars above, shining with all their light.\nAnd thus, he made his decision, born of wisdom's gentle might,\nTo send an envoy, with gifts and peace offerings, to end the strife and blight.\n\nThe neighboring prince, taken aback by kindness unlooked for,\nDidst lay down arms and seek a lasting, peaceful yore.\nThe war was ended, and the people rejoiced at last,\nTheir king, wise and just, had found a path that would forever last.",
