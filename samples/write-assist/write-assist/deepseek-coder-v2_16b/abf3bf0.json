  "output": " In hamlet of Elsinore, there was a noble named Hamlet, whose thoughts oft did stray from courts and councils. The prince beheld his father dead, by shadows of the night, taken too soon to a cold bed in winter’s clime. Mad with grief, he spoke thus to himself, “To be or not to be, that is the question”. His mother's hasty marriage with his uncle troubled Hamlet most foully.\n\nThus began the tale of woe, where love and duty did debate. For Hamlet loved Ophelia dear, but she had married Hamlet’s uncle in haste. His heart thus wrenched, he plotted vengeance on this wretch who stole his birthright from him. With feigned lunacy, Hamlet cast a play before the king; wherein he acted murder most foully done.\n\nTold you it was a tale of woe, where shadows and deceit did lie. For when Ophelia heard that her beloved had played such tricks upon this courtly life, she fell into the blackest pit of grief. In despair, she spake thus in broken tone: “My lord, my love, what foul play is this?” Alas! To be or not to be did plague poor Hamlet’s mind.\n\nAnd so, dear friends, remember that a noble man may fall, hurt by shadows and deceitful tale. For Hamlet’s plight could teach us all a thing or two about true love and the price of honor. So let us learn from Hamlet's saga; to beware of shadows in our own days."
