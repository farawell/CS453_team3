  "output": " Upon a time of nature’s ire,\nWhen winds did howl and skies did bare \nTheir fury in the daylight clear,\nI stood amazed to see the fair Earth quake.\n\nThe trees, which swayingly swung high,\nDid now with vigour make their plight,\nAnd every river swelled to cry.\n“What is this tempest, nature’s vow?” I did query.\n\nThen felt I in myself a fear,\nAs if each fibre of my being were \nIn league with the wild storm’s will.\n“O heart!” I cried, “thou dost outshine \nThe petty fret and conflict of the day: \nFor thou art not made for such dismay.”\n\nThus nature spake to me in that hour,\nWith tempest's roar and lightning's flare,\nAnd taught me thus much from her lore:\nThat though she oft doth rage and strive,\nShe only seeks to balance life,\nHer wrath a teacher is and not demise."
