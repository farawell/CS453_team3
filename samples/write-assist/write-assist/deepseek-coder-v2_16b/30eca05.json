  "output": " Ah, my dear heart, how art thou changed!\nSince first our eyes did meet and love's sweet fire did blaze,\nThy presence was a balm to heal all wounds.\nNow, through some dark mischance, 'tis gone, like morning dew.\n \nWhat wilt thou think of me, when I am lost in thought?\nWillst thou remember how we danced the night away and laughed aloud?\nAlas, these moments past, they seem but fleeting dreams now laid to rest.\n \nTake heart, dear love, for though my soul hath felt a chill,\nFrom out this frozen earth, where love once thrived in verdant yield,\nI'll tend my broken heart with memories of the garden green we knew.\n \nSo let us not forget the sweetness that did bind our souls together tight,\nBut hold them close within our minds and keep their warmth alight.\nFor even in the darkest night, there whispers through the bitter cold,\nOf flowers yet to bloom where love once grew abundant and bold."
