  "output": " Upon a night of chill and darkness spread,\nMy heart did quake at tidings most foul,\nA hand that oft hath held my heart in trust,\nHath dealt me grievous harm beyond all worth.\n\nUpon this stage where love once danced so light,\nNow shadows fall like thickest winter's night.\nThe moon doth hide her face as shame doth rise,\nAnd stars of doubt outshine the twinkling lights.\n\nAh, heart, how oft thou didst deceive with hope,\nPromising joys that now promise nothing save some strife!\nI thought thy love eternal as the stream,\nBut lo! A serpent slips through grass so green.\n\nO treacherous friend, to whom I bare my soul,\nWhose words did gladden me in sunlit bower,\nNow spurns me from thee with such scornful cold,\nAs if I were but a deceitful shadow.\n\nFarewell then, love, that once was all too dear;\nHere ends this tale of woe where trust was sold for ill.\nIn sorrow's bed shall thoughts of thee be rolled,\nAnd every fond remembrance now doth yield their toll.\n\nLet my heart bleed in silence under night's veil,\nWhile thy deceitful words upon the air do weave their spell.\nThus ends this poem of betrayal wrought so well by love's deceit;\nA tale of woe that should be writ in every heart's text."
