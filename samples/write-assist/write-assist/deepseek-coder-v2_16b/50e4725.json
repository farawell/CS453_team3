  "output": " In sooth, 'twas a night of eerie calm, the moon's pale beams cast shadows long and deep across the cobblestone streets. Hamlet, young and noble, paced his chamber, troubled by thoughts too heavy for slumber. Just as the lonesome chime of midnight tolled its final note, he heard a soft tap upon the casement—a sound so faint it might have been naught but the wind's idle breath.\n\nWith a heart that thumped heavily against his ribs, Hamlet crept to the window and flung open the shutter. Lo and behold! A specter stood before him, shrouded in such deep and utter darkness that only the moon's dim light revealed its outline—a figure so indistinct yet so undeniably present as to be neither friend nor foe but something altogether unknown and terrifyingly familiar.\n\n\"Hamlet, thou art a man of wit,\" the specter spake, though his voice was muffled by the grave itself from whence it seemed to rise. \"Thou shouldst not fear me; I am thy late father's spirit come to speak with thee.\"\n\nHorrified yet curious, Hamlet summoned what wits remained to him. \"Speak, ghost!\" he cried, \"speak! Or if thou art a devil, forbear to torment me in vain. Tell me who put thy魂魄 into that figure?\"\n\nThe specter, ever enigmatic and cloaked in mystery, did not so much pass on tidings as it did impart them—a tale of woe, a prophecy, a warning too dire for ears untrained to such portentous news: \"To be or not to be, that is the question.\" The ghost then vanished with a flourish more thrilling than death itself could summon.\n\nHamlet, left reeling by this unexpected and foreboding visit, spent the remainder of the night contemplating mortality, his own life's path, and the mysteries of heaven and earth. And so began Hamlet's journey into self-discovery and the eternal questions that haunt us all."
