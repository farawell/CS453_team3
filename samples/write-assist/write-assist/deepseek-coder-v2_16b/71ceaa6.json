  "output": " Upon a morn of chill October fair,  \nThe leaves, in scarlet and gold were yarred.  \nThe sun did shine bright upon the earth,  \nAnd all the world was bathed in its warm birth.\n\nAutumn doth show her beauty rare,  \nWith colors rich that art thou to admire.  \nHer golden cornfields sway with the breeze,  \nAs if unto the sky they'd reach their dees.\n\nThe fields were dressed in hues of red and gold,  \nA sight so grand that all could not but hold their old bellies full.  \nFor in this season of mellow fruitfulness,  \nNature doth paint her most poetic crest.\n\nOh how the leaves do fall and float by,  \nLike flocks unto the earth they do stray.  \nAnd as we gaze upon the beauty fair,  \nWe're filled with joy that such abundance there is to share!"
