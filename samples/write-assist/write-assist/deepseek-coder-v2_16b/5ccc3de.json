  "output": " Verily, 'tis a song of victory we shall sing,  \nWith words that please the ear and stir the heart within.  \nThough battles raged and foes did fiercely fight,  \nYet victors rise, their spirits e'er alight.  \n \nLet us rejoice in triumphâ€™s sweet embrace,  \nAnd praise the gods for blessings granted grace.  \nFor warriors fought with valor bright,  \nAnd peace was wrought where once there were strife and spite.  \n \nSo let us raise our glasses high and clink,  \nTo those who stood and valiantly did keep.  \nTheir courage shone like stars in night so dark,  \nAnd victory's banner now doth proudly hang.  \n \nHail to the heroes! Hail to the band!  \nWhose valor was the cause of all this grand stand.  \nLet songs be sung for triumphs great and small,  \nFor victors triumph, never to fall."
