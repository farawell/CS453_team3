  "output": " Upon a modest maid, whose virtues shine bright as the stars in night,\nStandards of her worth are held high, and she doth hold herself most right.\n \nShe values not the flashy gold or gems that glitter in the sun;\nInstead, she treasures virtue's pure light that shines within her dome.\n \nHer heart is virtuous as a dove, whose love for husband holds true;\nIn loyalty and faith she stands unshaken, like a rock on the shore.\n \nSo let us praise this gentle lady, with words of respect and awe,\nFor in each virtue shown, there lies a treasure that cannot be bought or sold, dear."
