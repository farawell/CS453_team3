  "Reasoning": "Checks creativity and thematic alignment.",
  "evaluation": "When the morn doth break with gentle sigh,  \nAnd night's soft curtain slowly doth withdraw,  \nA lover's heart with heaviness doth lie,  \nFor parting cometh ere the morningâ€™s awe.  \n\nO sweet beloved, whose eyes like stars do gleam,  \nThy presence is the sun that warms my soul.  \nYet time, the thief, doth steal away our dream,  \nAnd leaves a void that only love can sole.  \n\nThough distance may betwixt our bodies stand,  \nThe bind of hearts, like tendrils, shall not break.  \nIn every hourglass droppeth golden sand,  \nYet love's true strength no absence can unmake.  \n\nSo part we now, with vows of constancy,  \nTill fate, with gentle hand, returns thee to me."
