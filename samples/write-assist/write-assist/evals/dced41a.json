  "Reasoning": "Assesses formal language and poetic rhythm.",
  "evaluation": "When tempest doth upon the earth descend,  \nAnd skies unleash their furious, wild refrain,  \nThe trembling boughs in agony do bend,  \nWhilst torrents fall like tears of Heaven's pain.  \n\nThe mighty oak, once proud, doth bow its head,  \nAs thunderous roars doth shake the firmament;  \nThe stream that gently flowed is now a dread,  \nA raging beast by wrathful winds now bent.  \n\nO Nature, with thy fearsome, choler strength,  \nThou showest man his feeble, mortal state;  \nFor in thy wake, destruction broad and length,  \nRemindeth all of fate none can abate.  \n\nYet, when thy fury wanes and peace returns,  \nThe sun in splendor oâ€™er the land now burns.
