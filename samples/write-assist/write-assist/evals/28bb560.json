The trumpet sounds from yonder hill,  \nThe valiant knight returns with noble grace.  \nHis deeds of valor all the world shall fill,  \nAnd joyous revelry doth time embrace.  \n\nBehold, he cometh clad in armor bright,  \nHis visage bold, yet gentle doth appear.  \nThe stars themselves do pale before his light,  \nAs he doth stride, the hearts of men to cheer.  \n\nRefrain:  \nSing, O muse, of courage high and true,  \nFor he hath vanquished darkness, brought the day.  \nHis tale shall echo through the ages new,  \nAs he, the hero, homeward makes his way.  \n\nThe maidens fair do weave him garlands sweet,  \nWith roses red and lilies pure as snow.  \nIn every heart his name doth joy repeat,  \nFor he hath conquered every fearsome foe.  \n\nNow let the feast begin, and let us raise  \nA cup to honor him, the brave and bold.  \nWith song and dance, we sing his endless praise,  \nHis story evermore shall e'er be told.  \n\nRefrain:  \nSing, O muse, of courage high and true,  \nFor he hath vanquished darkness, brought the day.  \nHis tale shall echo through the ages new,  \nAs he, the hero, homeward makes his way."
