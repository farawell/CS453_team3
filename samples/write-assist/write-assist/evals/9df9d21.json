  "Reasoning": "Ensures relevance and creative response.",
  "evaluation": "In yonder court where shadows softly creep,  \nA tale unfolds of trust in woeful plight.  \nA heart once pure, now plunged in treacherous deep,  \nWhere loyalty is shorn of all its light.  \n\nO, fairest friend, thou hast my soul beguiled,  \nWith honeyed words that masked a serpent's sting.  \nThee, whom I cherished, now hath me reviled,  \nThy dagger's thrust the cruelest suffering.  \n\nIn gardens where our laughter once did bloom,  \nNow silence reigns, a testament to pain.  \nThe flowers withered, choked by bitter gloom,  \nIn memory's grasp, the echoes still remain.  \n\nThus, let this verse a warning ever be,  \nOf trust misplaced and love's cruel treachery."
