  "Reasoning": "Tests adherence to Shakespearean style and language. All components are used.",
  "evaluation": "Alas, the gentle heart doth break anew,  \nFor love once bright, hath vanished 'neath the moon.  \nIn yonder days when passion's fire flew,  \nThe world did dance to love's enchanting tune.  \n\nYet now the shadows creep where light once lay,  \nThe whispered vows that time hath swept away.  \nA rose once fair, now withered in decay,  \nForlorn doth lie in fields of yesterday.  \n\nO fleeting love, thou art a cruel jest,  \nThat stealeth joy and leaveth but despair.  \nThe tender heart no longer findeth rest,  \nFor memories of thee still linger there.  \n\nBut though the tears like gentle rivers flow,  \nThe soul in time may learn again to glow.
