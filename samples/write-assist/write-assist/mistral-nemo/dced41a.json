  "output": "In verily forests where the trees do weep,\nThe winds doth howl with sorrowful regret;\nFor nature's wrath hath stirred her heart to seethe,\nAnd lo! Her vengeance falls upon us yet.\n\nUpon mine own head, I feel her heavy hand,\nAs storm clouds gather in the darkened sky;\nHer lightning bolts like arrows swiftly span,\nStriking fear into each creature nearby.\n\nThe rivers rise with angry, muddy flow,\nSwallowing lands that once were green and fair;\nWhilst hailstones fall like cannons' fiery glow,\nFlaying the earth with icy, bitter care.\n\nThus doth nature vent her furious ire,\nSpurning our hubris with fierce, swift fire."
