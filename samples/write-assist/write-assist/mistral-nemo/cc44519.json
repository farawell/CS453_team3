I must decline her tempting fetter,\nFor duty calls me forth, my heart doth reckon.\n\n**Chorus:**\nI vow by sword and shield, by honor's sacred flame,\nTo serve my liege with steadfast faith I pledge.\nThough soft words whisper, vows of love proclaim,\nMy path lies elsewhere, by my troth I'll not stray."
