  "output": "In the heart of a mountain, dark and vast,\nThere lies a lair where creatures fiery dwell.\nA dragon slumbereth, fierce and harsh,\nUpon a hoard of treasures, gems that tell.\n\n\"Awaken not the beast,\" cried voices wise,\n\"It sleeps but waits for fools to trespass near.\"\nYet, forth we went, with hearts aflame in lies,\nTo face the dragon, quench our burning fear."
