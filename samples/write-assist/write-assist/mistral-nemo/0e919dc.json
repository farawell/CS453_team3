  "output": "In the roiling seas of Verily's Wrath,\nA vessel brave, by Neptune's will was hurled.\nWood splintered wide as if by axe'd stroke,\nAnd mast did crack like thunder's mighty toll.\n\nUpon the deck, fair captain cried aloud,\n\"Ye mariners bold, take to thy boats with haste!\nFor Neptune doth demand our lives this night,\nAnd none shall stay who would defy his wrath.\"\n\nWith hearts aflame and courage undeterred,\nThey took their leave from ship that once was home.\nUpon the waves they bobbed like corks adrift,\nUntil at last, they reached yonder shore unknown.\n\nWhat tales couldst thou unfold, O windswept isle,\nOf treasures hid and dangers yet unseen?\nBut that is tale for another time, fair friend,\nFor now, 'tis but a glimmer of wreckage past."
