  "output": "Upon the midnight's stroke, in castle dark,\nA spectral form did entrance make,\nIts visage pale, its eyes a fiery spark,\nWhilst silence held its breath for spectre's sake.\n\n\"Who art thou,\" quoth the lord of manor grand,\n\"I know not thy presence, nor thy name.\"\nThe ghost, with voice like winds through hollow land,\nSpake thus: \"I am thine ancestor, famed,\nYet bound by chains of guilt and earthly strife.\nHeed well mine words, lest thou follow my plight.\"\n\n\"What wouldst thou have me do?\" the lord inquiry made,\n\"To right the wrongs that hold thy spirit fast?\"\nThe ghost did sigh, its form began to fade,\n\"But speak not of this meeting, ne'er let past\nEscape thy lips. For if thou dost betray,\nIn chains like mine, thou too shalt dwell for aye.\""
