  "output": "In fair Verona's walls, where once I strode with pride,\nThere dwells a man whose fortunes ebb like tide.\nA lord of old, now humbled by fate's decree,\nHis gold doth tarnish, and his title mean naught but memory.\n\nOnce wooed by maidens fair, now shunned like plague,\nHis jests once laughed at, met now with hollow plague.\nYet in his heart, a spark doth still remain,\nA beacon of hope amidst life's cruel rain.\n\n\"Thou art no more than thou hast made thyself,\"\nSaith he, \"And though fortune's wheel hath turned amiss,\nI will not yield to despair's dark embrace.\nFor virtue and honour shall forever be mine apace.\"\n\nThus doth our nobleman stand firm despite the storm,\nHis spirit unbroken, his courage reformed.\nThough once he fell from grace, and lost all claim,\nYet still he stands tall, with hope in his aim.\n\nForsooth, 'tis written that even from the ash,\nA Phoenix shall rise, reborn of fire's smash.\nSo let it be known, though low he doth lie,\nThe nobleman's fall is but a stepping-stone to the sky."
