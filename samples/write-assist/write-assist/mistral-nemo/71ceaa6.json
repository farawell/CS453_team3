  "output": "In autumn's cloak of fiery hue,\nWhere leaves like embers softly blew,\nI sing a tale of faded grace,\nOf beauty that doth fade apace.\n\n\"Hark! Yonder comes the chill wind's sigh,\nAs summer's warmth doth take its leave.\nThe trees do put on robes so red,\nTo bid adieu to verdant green.\n\nYet in this season's dying breath,\nThere lieth beauty most profound.\nFor nature weaveth tapestry\nOf gold and crimson on the ground.\n\nThus, let us feast our eyes on this,\nEre winter's grasp doth take control.\nAnd though the leaves may fall and fade,\nTheir memory shall forever scroll.\""
