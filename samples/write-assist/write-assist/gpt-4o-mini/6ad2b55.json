  "output": "Oh, gentle friend, whose heart dost shine so bright,  \nIn shadows deep, thou art my guiding light.  \nThrough tempests fierce and trials of the day,  \nThy steadfast bond doth never fade away.  \n\nLike golden threads that weave through fate's own loom,  \nThy laughter banishes the clouds of gloom.  \nWith every jest and tale of yore we share,  \nA tapestry of joy beyond compare.  \n\nWhen sorrows weigh, and burdens grow so great,  \nThou art the balm that eases my sad fate.  \nIn silence sweet, or in the loudest cheer,  \nThy presence, dear, doth make all troubles clear.  \n\nSo let us raise our cups to days of yore,  \nAnd pledge our hearts to cherish evermore.  \nFor true companionship, like stars above,  \nShall shine eternal in the realm of love."
