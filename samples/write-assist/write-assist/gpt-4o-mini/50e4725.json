  "output": "In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,  \nA tale of woe and spectral wights I glean.  \n'Twas on a night, 'neath moon's pale, silvery glow,  \nWhen whispers of the past began to flow.  \n\nIn yon ancient castle, where shadows dwell,  \nLived young Elena, in a love's sweet spell.  \nYet sorrow's hand did clutch her tender heart,  \nFor her betrothed, noble Hector, did depart.  \n\nOne eve, as stars adorned the velvet sky,  \nShe wandered forth, with naught but tears to cry.  \nA chill wind blew, and the air grew thick,  \nWhen from the gloom, a figure dark did flick.  \n\n\"Elena, fair,\" spake he, his voice like mist,  \n\"I am thy love, though death hath us dismissed.  \nIn dreams I haunt, and in shadows I dwell,  \nFor love doth conquer, even 'yond the knell.\"  \n\nWith trembling breath, she gazed upon his face,  \nA visage pale, yet filled with loveâ€™s embrace.  \n\"O Hector, sweet! Thou art a ghostly sight,  \nWhat sorrow hath befallen thee this night?\"  \n\n\"Fear not, my love, for I am ever thine,  \nThough fate's cruel hand hath drawn this darkened line.  \nI come to bid thee live and love anew,  \nFor life is but a fleeting, precious dew.\"  \n\n\"Yet how can I, when all my days feel bleak?  \nThe heart doth ache, and solitude doth speak.\"  \n\"Let not despair, like winter's frost, ensnare,  \nFor love, though lost, shall always linger there.\"  \n\nAs dawn did break, the phantom began to fade,  \nLeaving but a whisper in the glade.  \nElena stood, her heart with hope now rife,  \nFor love, though ghostly, still doth give us life.  \n\nThus, in the quietude of morning's light,  \nShe vowed to cherish love, both day and night.  \nFor even when the shadows call and sigh,  \nTrue love, once kindled, shall never die.
