  "output": "In days of yore, when knights were bold,  \nAnd tales of dragons fierce were oft retold,  \nThere lay a lair, upon a hill so steep,  \nWhere shadows danced, and secrets long did keep.  \n\n'Twas nestled 'neath the boughs of ancient trees,  \nWhence whispered winds brought forth a chilling breeze.  \nThe entrance, wrought of stone and shrouded gloom,  \nDid guard the treasures of the beast’s dark tomb.  \n\nWithin, a creature fierce and proud did dwell,  \nWith scales like emeralds, and eyes that cast a spell.  \nHis breath, a tempest; his roar, a thunder's might,  \nHe guarded gold and jewels, both day and night.  \n\nYet, in this lair, a heart did beat so bold,  \nFor 'neath the ferocious guise of scales untold,  \nLay wisdom vast, and a longing deep as night,  \nA yearning for a friend, a kindred soul's delight.  \n\nOne day a knight, Sir Cedric was his name,  \nWith courage firm and heart aflame,  \nDid seek the dragon's lair, not for gold nor claim,  \nBut rather to know the creature, and end his bane.  \n\n“Great beast!” quoth he, as shadows cloaked the way,  \n“I come not for thy treasure, nor for thee to slay.  \nBut hear my words, for I seek to understand,  \nThy heart, thy soul, and what lies close at hand.”  \n\nThe dragon, startled, paused in his fierce might,  \nAnd gazed upon the knight, both curious and bright.  \n“Speak, noble Sir, for I am weary of this strife,  \nIn solitude I dwell, deprived of joy and life.”  \n\nThus began a bond, forged in twilight’s glow,  \nA friendship blossomed where none did dare to go.  \nIn the dragon's lair, beneath the starlit sky,  \nTwo souls entwined, as ages drifted by.  \n\nSo let it be known, in tales both old and grand,  \nThat even in darkness, friendship takes a stand.  \nFor in the heart of a dragon, fierce and aloof,  \nThere lies the capacity for love, and truth."
