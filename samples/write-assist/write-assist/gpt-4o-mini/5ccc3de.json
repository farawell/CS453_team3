  "output": "**A Ballad of Triumph**\n\n(Verse 1)  \nWhen dawn doth break upon the field so fair,  \nWith banners high and hearts that boldly dare,  \nWe tread with courage, clad in valor's hue,  \nFor every trial met, we shall pursue.\n\n(Chorus)  \nO victory! Thy sweet embrace we seek,  \nIn every triumph, let our spirits speak.  \nWith swords aloft, and voices raised on high,  \nWe claim our fate beneath the azure sky.\n\n(Verse 2)  \nThough tempests rage and shadows stretch their hand,  \nWe stand united, a resolute band.  \nFor in our hearts, the flame of courage burns,  \nAnd from our toil, a brighter future turns.\n\n(Chorus)  \nO victory! Thy sweet embrace we seek,  \nIn every triumph, let our spirits speak.  \nWith swords aloft, and voices raised on high,  \nWe claim our fate beneath the azure sky.\n\n(Bridge)  \nLet not despair entwine our noble quest,  \nFor each brave heart shall face the fateful test.  \nTogether we shall weave a tale of pride,  \nIn glorious battle, let our spirits bide.\n\n(Chorus)  \nO victory! Thy sweet embrace we seek,  \nIn every triumph, let our spirits speak.  \nWith swords aloft, and voices raised on high,  \nWe claim our fate beneath the azure sky.\n\n(Outro)  \nSo raise the cup, and let the revels start,  \nFor in our triumphs, binds the beating heart.  \nTo victory, we toast with joy profound,  \nIn unity, our glory shall resound."
