  "output": "**A Ballad of Autumn's Grace**\n\nWhen golden leaves in whispers dance,  \n'Neath boughs adorned in amber hue,  \nThe gentle breeze doth take its chance,  \nTo serenade the world anew.  \n\nO Autumn! Thy fair beauty shines,  \nIn twilight's soft, embracing glow;  \nThy harvest fields, with earth's designs,  \nBestow a bounty rich and slow.  \n\nThe sun doth sink in skies of fire,  \nWhile shadows lengthen, cool and deep;  \nIn every heart, thou dost inspire,  \nA tender longing, sweet and steep.  \n\nWhen twilight's breath doth hush the day,  \nAnd stars in velvet skies appear,  \nThy fleeting moments, come what may,  \nShall linger long, for all we hold dear.  \n\nSo let us raise a cup of cheer,  \nTo Autumn's grace, both bold and true;  \nFor in her arms, we find no fear,  \nBut joy in every shade and hue.
