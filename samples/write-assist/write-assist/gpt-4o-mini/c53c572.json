  "output": "In fair Verona’s enchanted glade,  \nWhere ancient oaks do whisper secrets old,  \nThere dwelt a valiant knight, Sir Cedric brave,  \nWhose heart was fierce, and spirit yet untold.  \n\nUpon a morn, when sun did gild the skies,  \nA maiden fair, with tear-streaked visage bright,  \nDid seek the knight, her sorrowful cries  \nEntreating him to aid her in her plight.  \n\n“O noble Cedric, heed my woeful tale;  \nA dragon fierce, with breath of fire and ash,  \nHath taken captive my dear father pale,  \nAnd in his lair, he doth await the crash.”  \n\nWith steadfast heart, Sir Cedric swore an oath,  \n“To rescue thee, I shall not rest nor sleep;  \nFor honor’s sake, I pledge my very troth,  \nAnd to thy side, my gallant steed shall leap.”  \n\nThus armed with sword, and clad in shining mail,  \nHe set forth on his quest, through vale and hill,  \nHis heart a drum, his courage would not fail,  \nFor love and valor bid him onward still.  \n\nUpon the dragon's lair, a mountain steep,  \nWhere shadows danced like phantoms in the night,  \nHe found the beast, whose roar could rouse the deep,  \nAnd with a battle cry, prepared to fight.  \n\nSteel clashed with scale, a tempest born of might,  \nThe knight did parry, thrust, and dodge with grace,  \nUntil with one swift stroke, ‘neath moon’s pale light,  \nHe gave the beast its due, and won the place.  \n\nWith victory secured, he freed the sage,  \nAnd back to fair Verona they did ride,  \nFor honor gained and love unbound by age,  \nA tale of valor and of hearts allied.  \n\nThus ends the quest of Sir Cedric, stout of heart,  \nA knight whose gallant deeds shall never part  \nFrom memory’s embrace, where legends dwell,  \nIn whispered tales, where all good stories tell."
