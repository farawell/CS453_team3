  "output": "**A Tragic Shipwreck: The Tale of the Ocean's Wrath**\n\nIn fair Verona, where we set our scene,  \nA vessel bold, the *Seafarer*, did gleam.  \nWith sails unfurled, 'neath bright celestial dome,  \nIt ventured forth, seeking fortune's sweet home.  \n\nAlas! The fates did conspire most dire,  \nFor tempest fierce did rise, and fierce did fire.  \nThe winds did howl, as if the heavens wept,  \nAnd Neptune's fury o'er the waters crept.  \n\n\"Ho! Heave ho!\" cried Captain, brave and bold,  \nWith heart of lion, yet of visage cold.  \n\"O crew, hold fast! For we shall yet prevail,  \nThough storms may rage, and hope doth seem so frail.\"  \n\nBut lo! The waves, like monstrous giants' might,  \nDid crash upon the deck with fearsome blight.  \nThe mast did shatter, splintered by the gale,  \nAnd sailors' cries did pierce the night's dark veil.  \n\n\"Fie on this cruel fate!\" one sailor cried,  \n\"To be consumed by ocean's hungry tide!\"  \nYet hope, like a flick'ring candle's flame,  \nDid flicker still, in hearts that knew no shame.  \n\nAs ship did sway 'twixt life and death's embrace,  \nA lone figure stood, steadfast in his place.  \nWith arms outstretched, he prayed to gods above,  \n“Spare us, O deities! We seek thy love!”  \n\nBut the sea, relentless, claimed its due,  \nAnd swallowed whole the ship, the brave crew too.  \nYet in that dark abyss, a glimmer shone,  \nThe spirit of the ocean, all alone.  \n\nThus ends this woeful tale of men and sea,  \nA shipwreck lost to fate’s cruel decree.  \nIn memory they live, forever entwined,  \nIn depths of ocean, their souls defined.  \n\nSo heed this warning, sailors brave and bold,  \nRespect the sea, for it is fierce and cold.  \nFor though its beauty doth the heart entice,  \nThe ocean’s wrath is never paid in slice."
