  "output": "O treachery most foul, a serpent's kiss,  \nIn shadows deep where trust hath met its end,  \nThou wert my friend, yet now dost bring me this—  \nA dagger masked, thy heart doth not defend.\n\nWith honeyed words, thou wove a web so fine,  \nEntwined my soul in bonds of false delight;  \nYet in thine eyes, a tempest dost confine,  \nThe spark of loyalty extinguished quite.\n\nO, how the once bright stars dost fade away,  \nWhen loyalty lies shattered on the floor.  \nThy acts have turned the night to endless day,  \nAnd love, once pure, now aches forevermore.\n\nThus, let this heart, once full, now know despair,  \nFor betrayal’s sting is cruel and rare."
