As time, that fickle friend, dost wane,\nHis virtues, once so bright, began to fade.\nFor power's sweet allure, a poisoned bane,\nDid lead him down a path where darkness strayed.\n\nHis vassals, once so loyal, turned away,\nFor whispers of betrayal filled the air.\nWith lavish feasts, he sought to keep at bay\nThe shadows of his sins, yet found despair.\n\nThen came a night, when fortune’s wheel did turn,\nA tempest wild unleashed upon his reign.\nThe whispers grew to shouts; the fires did burn,\nAnd all he cherished turned to dust and pain.\n\nWhen dawn arose, his castle stood in ruins,\nOnce mighty walls now crumbled ‘neath the sky.\nSir Cedric, lost in grief and bitter doings,\nDid weep for what was gone, a woeful sigh.\n\nIn solitude, he wandered by the brook,\nWhere once he’d laughed and danced ‘neath starlit skies.\nNow nature’s beauty in his heart forsook,\nDid mirror forth his tears, as sorrow cries.\n\nThus, noble Cedric learned, in wretched plight,\nThat pride doth oft lead to a tragic fall.\nFor in the chase of power, one doth lose sight\nOf honor’s worth, and love’s most gentle call.\n\nTherefore, take heed, ye lords and ladies fair,\nLest hubris blind thee to thy fragile fate.\nFor in the game of life, one must beware,\nThat all we hold may crumble, ere too late."
