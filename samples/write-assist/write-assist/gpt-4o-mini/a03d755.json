  "output": "In gardens fair where gentle breezes play,  \nThere dwells a lady, pure as morning's light,  \nHer virtue shines, a beacon in the day,  \nWith grace and poise, she banishes the night.  \n\nHer heart, a chalice filled with tender grace,  \nEach word she speaks, a melody of truth;  \nIn every glance, a world doth interlace,  \nA timeless beauty, uncorrupted youth.  \n\nThough tempests rage and shadows seek to sway,  \nHer spirit stands, unyielding, ever bright;  \nFor in her soul, no vice can find its way,  \nA noble heart, adorned in virtueâ€™s light.  \n\nO, let the world behold her radiant glow,  \nFor she, a paragon, doth virtue show.
