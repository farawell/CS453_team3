  "output": "**A Sailor’s Life: A Ballad of the Sea**\n\n*Verse 1:*  \nOh, to the ocean's bosom I dost sail,  \nWhere tempests roar and whispering gales prevail.  \nWith canvas spread and heart so bold,  \nI chase the sun, and stories oft retold.  \n\n*Chorus:*  \nHo! A sailor's life is sweet and free,  \nWith salt upon my brow, I long to be,  \n’Neath stars that twinkle in the night,  \nI find my solace in the moon’s soft light.  \n\n*Verse 2:*  \nThe waves dost crash like thunder’s might,  \nYet in their roar, I find delight.  \nFor each horizon, a new tale shall spin,  \nOf distant lands and the kin within.  \n\n*Chorus:*  \nHo! A sailor's life is sweet and free,  \nWith salt upon my brow, I long to be,  \n’Neath stars that twinkle in the night,  \nI find my solace in the moon’s soft light.  \n\n*Bridge:*  \nWhen darkened skies dost cloak the day,  \nAnd tempest’s wrath doth lead astray,  \nFear not, my heart, for I am strong,  \nWith courage firm, I sing my song.  \n\n*Verse 3:*  \nSo let the winds and tides conspire,  \nFor in their dance, I find my fire.  \nA sailor’s heart, forever young,  \nIn every port, new songs are sung.  \n\n*Chorus:*  \nHo! A sailor's life is sweet and free,  \nWith salt upon my brow, I long to be,  \n’Neath stars that twinkle in the night,  \nI find my solace in the moon’s soft light.  \n\n*Outro:*  \nThus, raise the flag, let joy unfold,  \nFor in the sea’s embrace, my spirit bold.  \nWith every wave that doth arise,  \nI live, I love, ‘neath boundless skies."
