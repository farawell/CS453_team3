  "output": "Upon a time, when hearts did dance in bloom,  \nTwo souls entwined beneath the silver moon.  \nYet fickle fate, with cruel hand, did sever,  \nWhat once was bliss, now fades, now lost forever.  \n\nThou wert the sun that lit my darkest day,  \nWith tender whispers that did gently sway.  \nBut shadows creep upon our love’s fair light,  \nAnd silence reigns in the stillness of night.  \n\nAs autumn leaves, so doth our passion wane,  \nIn memory’s grasp, I linger midst the pain.  \nOft do I gaze upon the stars above,  \nAnd mourn the fleeting ghost of vanished love.  \n\nThough time may heal, and wounds may close anew,  \nYet still, my heart dost ache for thee, my true.  \nIn dreams, I seek the warmth of thy embrace,  \nBut waking finds but sorrow in its place.
