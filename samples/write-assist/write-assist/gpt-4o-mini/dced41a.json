  "output": "Upon the stormy breath of vengeful skies,  \nWhere tempests roar and lightning doth arise,  \nNature, in fury, doth unleash her might,  \nA symphony of chaos, day turned night.  \n\nThe trees, like giants, bend beneath her hand,  \nWhilst rivers swell and claim the trembling land.  \nWith thunder's voice, she cries a mournful song,  \nA tale of rage where all the meek belong.  \n\nYet in her wrath, there lies a beauty rare,  \nFor from destruction blooms the fragrant air.  \nAs tempest fades and calm doth reappear,  \nThe earth, reborn, doth shed her cloak of fear.  \n\nSo let us heed the whispers of the breeze,  \nFor nature's wrath, though fierce, hath wisdom's keys.  \nIn every storm, a lesson to discern,  \nFrom chaos born, the fires of peace return.
