  "output": "In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,  \nA noble king, beset by woes unseen,  \nDid sit upon his gilded throne, alone,  \nWith heavy heart, the weight of crown hath grown.  \n\nKing Reginald, a ruler wise and just,  \nDid find his kingdom wrapped in shadowed mistrust.  \nTwo lords of worth, each pining for his grace,  \nDost challenge one another for the place.  \n\nLord Cedric, stalwart, with a heart of steel,  \nDoth rally troops, proclaiming, \"I shall heal  \nThe rift within our realm; my sword shall rise,  \nTo vanquish foes and bring forth brighter skies.\"  \n\nYet, on the other hand, young Lord Alaric,  \nWith charm so sweet, his words a silken trick,  \nDid whisper soft of peace and gentle ways,  \n“Let not our swords be drawn on summer days.”  \n\nThus, the king, in torment deep and dire,  \nDid ponder long, with heart set afire.  \nTo choose the path of war, 'twas noble, true,  \nYet peace, like morning dew, was sweet and new.  \n\n“Shall I forsake the strength that valour brings,  \nOr trust the soft embrace that kindness sings?”  \nHe paced the halls, his crown askew with doubt,  \nAs echoes of his conscience rang about.  \n\nAt last he summoned both, with voice profound:  \n“Good lords, I stand upon this hallowed ground.  \nThe fate of realms hang by a thread so fine;  \nIn choice, I see the weight of blood and wine.”  \n\n“Cedric, thou art valor’s fierce delight,  \nAnd Alaric, thy heart doth shine with light.  \nYet, in this moment, let us find accord,  \nA union forged, ‘tis better than a sword.”  \n\nThus, with a heart most brave, the king did weave  \nA compromise that both might well believe.  \nA peace was struck, with laughter, songs, and cheer,  \nAnd in that moment, love dispelled all fear.  \n\nSo learn ye, gentle souls, from Reginald’s quest,  \nThat oft the greatest strength lies not in jest,  \nBut in the bonds of friendship true and fair,  \nFor in such ties, a kingdom doth repair."
