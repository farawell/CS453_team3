  "output": "O, cruel fate that bids us part this day,  \nWhen hearts entwined in love's sweet, tender thrall,  \nYet time, relentless, doth not heed our sway,  \nAnd whispers softly of the evening's fall.  \n\nThou art the sun that lights my weary soul,  \nEach glance a spark, each word a gentle balm;  \nYet now, like waves that reach the distant shoal,  \nI feel the tempest riseâ€”my heart, a qualm.  \n\nWith heavy heart, I clasp thy hand in mine,  \nAs tears like dewdrops glisten on my cheek;  \nThough distance stretches wide, our love shall shine,  \nFor in my dreams, thy voice I still shall seek.  \n\nSo part we now, yet know this truth so clear:  \nIn every breath, my love, thou art still near.
