  "output": " Upon the briny sea, where waves do dance and play,\nA sailor's life doth lead him far away;\nWith winds that howl and tempests fierce and wild,\nThe ocean's wrath does test his courage child.\n\nHis heart, it beats with rhythm of the tide,\nIn every storm, he doth confide;\nYet in each dawn, upon the morning light,\nHe finds his joy in sailing through the night.\n\nUpon the deck, beneath the moon's soft glow,\nHe sings a song of love and sorrow;\nFor on the land, his sweetheart doth await,\nTheir love entwined by Fate's own date.\n\nYet he must roam where waters never cease,\nTo find his peace in storm's decrease;\nFor as the sailor's life is marked with strife,\nIt holds a beauty like no other life.\n\nSo raise your tankards high and sing along,\nOf sailors brave who journey strong;\nTheir spirits soar on winds that blow,\nAnd in their hearts, a tale doth glow."
