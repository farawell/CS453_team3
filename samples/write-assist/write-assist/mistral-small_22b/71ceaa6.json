  "output": " Upon the canvas of the sky,\nDoth Autumn paint her hues so high;\nIn crimson, gold, and sable dye,\nHer beauteous art doth catch mine eye.\n\nThe leaves do dance upon the breeze,\nAs if to sing in harmonies,\nA serenade to Summer's ease,\nAnd welcome Autumn's gentle tease.\n\nThou golden sun doth warm the earth,\nWith love and life bestowed at birth;\nYet Winter's breath is drawing nigh,\nBeneath his icy touch we sigh.\n\nOh, lovely season of mellow glow,\nThy splendor doth my heart enfold;\nIn thy embrace so soft and slow,\nI find a peace that cannot be told."
