  "output": " Dear user,\n\nIn the dead of night, whilst the moon doth cast its silvered glow upon mine window, I was beset by a spectral presence. A ghostly figure, clad in raiment of yore, appeared before me, its eyes filled with anguish and sorrow.\n\n\"Who art thou?\" I queried, my voice barely above a whisper, for fear that the very air would echo it back to me.\n\nThe specter spoke not, but it drifted closer, as if drawn by some unseen force. Its hand extended towards mine, cold and insubstantial, yet filled with an intense yearning.\n\n\"What dost thou seek?\" I asked once more, my heart pounding in my chest like the tolling of a funeral bell.\n\nFor a moment, it seemed as if the ghost might speak, but then it faded away, leaving naught but the chill air and the silence of the night.\n\nYet even now, as I pen this missive, I feel the cold touch of that phantom hand upon mine own, and I cannot help but wonder what message it sought to convey."
