  "output": " Upon the craggy peak where storms do gather,\nA dragon hath made his lair of dread,\nWith scales as black as night and breath like fire,\nHe reigns o'er all that dwell below or tread.\n\nIn caverns deep, amidst the treasures heaped,\nThere lies a sword, its blade forged from the sun,\nA hero seeks it now, his heart both brave\nAnd fearful too, for he knows what must be done.\n\n\"Approach not closer,\" roars the beast of old,\n\"For in this den, I am the king unseated.\nWhat brings thee here, thou mortal so bold?\nDost seek thy doom or some reward unsweetened?\"\n\nWith voice that trembles yet with determination clear,\nThe hero answers, \"Dragon, I come not for gold or fear,\nBut for this sword, whose light shall break thine evil spell,\nAnd free the land from shadows cast by thee.\"\n\n\"So be it then,\" the dragon grimly sighs,\n\"Thy quest is noble, yet thy end draws nigh.\nIn battle fierce, I'll test thy mettle true,\nBut know this well: thou canst not slay me anew.\"\n\nAnd so they fought, with flames and clashes loud,\nUntil at last, the hero stood victorious proud.\nFrom ashes rose, a king both strong and wise,\nHis tale of triumph echoed through the skies."
