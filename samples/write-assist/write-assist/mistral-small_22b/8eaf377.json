  "output": " Hark! O moon most fair and bright,\nThy silver light doth pierce the night.\nIn robes of splendour thou dost ride,\nA chaste maiden by thy side.\n\nHer gaze is fixed upon the earth,\nShe weeps for lovers lost their mirth.\nYet, in her tears, a promise lies,\nThat love shall never truly die.\n\nOh, gentle moon, thy beam so pure,\nDoth paint the world with hues obscure.\nThe shadows dance and whisper low,\nOf passion's flame that burns below.\n\nSo let us sing this sweet lament,\nTo thee, O moon, of love spent.\nFor thou art witness to each heartache,\nAnd every vow that lovers make."
