  "output": " In solemn tone, the winds do wail and keen,\nA mourning dirge for nature's wrathful scene;\nThe stormy sea doth roar in wild despair,\nIts waves like monsters clawing through the air.\n\nFrom heavens above, a torrent pours amain,\nAs thunder's voice doth echo o'er the plain;\nLightning doth strike with fiery, angry glare,\nA dreadful sight that makes the heart despair.\n\nThe trees do bend and tremble in their might,\nTheir leaves like shadows flee the night;\nThe hilltops quake and crumble to the ground,\nWhilst rivers rage and overflow their bound.\n\nOh, cursed be the day when nature's wrath\nDoth raze our homes and cause such bitter path!\nYet still we stand, with courage unyielding,\nHoping for peace that doth our hearts mending."
