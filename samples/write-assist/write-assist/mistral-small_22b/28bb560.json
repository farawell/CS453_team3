  "output": " Verily, in triumphant steps our hero doth tread,\nHis journey o'er, his foes vanquished, and his quest fulfilled.\nWith laurels on his brow and tales of derring-do,\nHe cometh home, where awaits him love so long denied.\n\nLo! The village throngs to greet him with a joyous song,\nAs banners wave and hearts do leap at his return.\nHis steed doth pace in majesty, its coat aglow,\nAnd in his hand, the sword that hath tasted blood of foes.\n\nBut what awaits our hero in this haven?\nWill she who once was fair and true still hold him dear?\nOr shall he find her heart hath wandered far astray,\nLost to another's arms or bound by promises?\n\nOh, let the night be filled with stars that shine above,\nAnd may they guide our hero to a love renewed.\nFor though his deeds are great and valour known afar,\nHis heart doth yearn for her, his prize in victories' wars."
