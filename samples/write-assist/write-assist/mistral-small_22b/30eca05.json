  "output": " Sure, pray allow me to assist thee in thy endeavor to craft a poem of love lost, in the style most regal and Shakespearean. Commence we now:\n\n---\n\n**Love Lost**\n\nUpon the altar of love's temple, a flame once burned bright,\nNow extinguished, lost to the night.\nThou art gone, dear love, like the morning's dew,\nLeaving my heart with naught but sorrow anew.\n\nLike the rose that withers in winter's icy grasp,\nOur love hath faded, as ephemeral as the vapor's breath.\nNo more thy laughter doth fill the air,\nNor dost thou whisper sweet nothings in mine ear.\n\nThe moon above witnesses our tale of woe,\nAs it casts a shimmering light on the path below.\nWhere once we walked hand in hand, now I tread alone,\nIn this realm where love and joy were once my own.\n\nYet fear not, dear heart, for time shall pass,\nAnd with it, the memory of our love's amassed.\nFor every sunset brings a new dawn's light,\nAnd in that light, there lies hope and delight."
