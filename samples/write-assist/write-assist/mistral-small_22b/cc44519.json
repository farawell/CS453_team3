  "output": " In the realm where hearts do softly sing,\nA knight doth ride on his steed of might,\nWith courage true and honor bright,\nHe seeks to serve both day and night.\n\n\"Fair maiden,\" quoth he, \"pray listen well,\nFor in my heart a tale I tell,\nOf knighthood's code that doth compel,\nMy every act with virtue dwell.\"\n\nHe pledges fealty to the weak,\nDefends the just and scorns the wicked,\nIn battle fierce, his prowess peaketh,\nYet gentleness his heart doth quicken.\n\n\"By mine own sword's edge I swear an oath,\nTo uphold chivalry in all my troth,\nThy hand I pledge to shield from wrath,\nAnd in thy name, I'll face the death.\""
