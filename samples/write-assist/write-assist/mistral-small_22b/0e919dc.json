  "output": " Upon the vast and tempestuous sea,\nA vessel fair did sail, with crew so bold,\nYet Neptune's wrath was not to be withstood,\nAs waves did rise like mountains, towering high.\n\nThe captain stood, his eyes upon the horizon,\n\"Steer clear, my men,\" quoth he, \"for peril looms!\"\nBut Fate, it seemed, had other plans in store,\nAs lightning struck and timbers splintered wide.\n\nWith cries of dread, the sailors leapt from deck,\nTheir hearts aflutter as they sought the shore,\nYet many found no haven 'neath the waves,\nTheir screams echoing through the night's dark shroud.\n\nUpon the rocks, a lone survivor lay,\nHis breath in gasps, his limbs awash with pain,\n\"Alas,\" he cried, \"my comrades lost to sea,\nAnd I, who live, am naught but wreckage left.\"\n\nYet hope did burn within his weary heart,\nFor lo! Upon the shore, a figure stood,\nWith torch aloft and eyes that shone with care,\nA beacon through the storm's relentless din."
