  "output": " Alas, my love, we must our farewells take,\nFor the cruel hand of destiny doth quake\nAnd tear us asunder with its iron might.\nYet fear not, sweetheart, for in mine heart,\nThou shalt forever hold a tender place.\nLike stars that shine when darkness cloaks the skies,\nOur love shall endure through time's relentless march.\nFarewell, my dearest, till we meet again."
