  "output": " Verily, gather 'round and lend thine ears to mine tale of woe. In days long past, a nobleman named Edgar did dwell within a grand palace by the name of Hawkwood. His lineage was noble, his reputation unblemished, and his wealth bountiful. Yet pride, that devil's minion, doth walk beside him, whispering lies into his heart.\n\nOne morn, as Edgar stood before his mirror, he gazed upon his reflection with a smug satisfaction. \"Thou art the fairest lord in all the land,\" quoth he. Yet, unbeknownst to him, his pride had grown like a poisonous vine, choking out all kindness and humility that once dwelt within him.\n\nNews of Edgar's vanity spread like wildfire throughout the kingdom. His courtiers began to whisper amongst themselves, their eyes cast downward in shame. The common folk, who once praised his name, now scoffed as he passed by, their hearts filled with disdain.\n\nOne fateful day, Edgar received a challenge from a humble knight, Sir Godfrey, whose heart was pure and whose skill with a sword was renowned throughout the land. \"Thou boastest of thy strength and valor,\" quoth Sir Godfrey. \"I pray thee, noble lord, prove thyself against mine own blade.\"\n\nWith arrogance burning in his chest, Edgar accepted the challenge. Yet, as they stood upon the field of combat, the sun blazing overhead, it became clear that Sir Godfrey's skill far surpassed that of the haughty nobleman. With a single strike, he disarmed Edgar, leaving him to stand humiliated before the crowd.\n\nShame and disgrace did wash over Edgar like a tidal wave. His once-loyal servants turned their backs upon him, his wealth vanished as swiftly as dewdrops beneath the sun's harsh gaze. Banished from Hawkwood, he wandered the countryside, clad in rags, his pride replaced by an abiding sorrow.\n\nOh, how the mighty have fallen! Let this tale be a warning to all who doth walk the path of arrogance and vanity. Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall."
