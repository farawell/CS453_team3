  "output": "Let her grace and virtue shine,\nAs fair as the moon in the night.\nHer heart is a sanctuary,\nFor all that may come to light.\n\nThrough trials, both great and small,\nShe doth bear with great fortitude. \nHer courage, unwavering and bold,\nIs like steel forged from fiery pride.\n\nAnd when love comes knocking at her door,\nShe doth welcome it with open arms.\nFor in this, she finds the truest treasure,\nOf all that makes a woman whole and warm.\n\nSo let us raise our voices high,\nAnd sing of the virtues so divine.\nMay they be blessed with every good day,\nOf grace and beauty and loving light."
