  "output": "Upon the mountains' crags, where vultures wheel,\nAnd where the tempests rage with mighty zeal,\nThere dwells a fury that doth rend and tear,\nNature’s fierce wrath, that none can quench or bear.\n\nFrom skies of blackness, clouds of fire descend,\nAs lightning strikes, and thunder roars profound.\nThe earth beneath is shaken to its core,\nFor nature's sake, in fits she doth adore.\n\nThe rivers swell, the forests burn with flame,\nAnd all do suffer by her wrathful claim.\nBut lo! The winds do turn their fury prone,\nFor nature’s wrath shall soon be tamed for one.\n\nSo may we learn from her fierce and mighty call,\nTo cherish life, and live in peace and health.\nFor nature's wrath is but the price of strife,\nAnd only through love can we truly thrive."
