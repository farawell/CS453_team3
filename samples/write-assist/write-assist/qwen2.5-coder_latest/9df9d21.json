  "actualOutput": "Betrayal, a word so foul,\nA sin most heinous and cruel.\nIt comes when trust is broken,\nAnd love for nought is sown.\n\nThou wouldest think that friendship would hold fast,\nYet one's true loyalty doth oft cast.\nAs the dawn doth rise, and shadows grow long,\nThe betrayal of a friend doth shine bright, with a pang.\n\nFor in the depths of darkness, we cannot hide,\nOur true nature, the light within us reside.\nAnd when that light is dimmed by betrayal's flame,\nOur hearts do ache, our spirits do become.\n\nSo let us take heed of this warning loud and clear,\nThat betrayal doth bring pain, sorrow and fear.\nFor in the end, it is love that doth endure,\nAnd loyalty that maketh us true.",
