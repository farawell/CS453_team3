  "output": "Upon a fateful evening deep and dark,\nA bond of trust, so frail and weak,\nWas torn by treacherous hands, most stark,\nAs love was turned to hate's deceitful mask.\n\nFor in the shadows cast by night,\nDid lies take form like venomous snakes,\nAnd those who loved, in darkness lived apart,\nTheir hearts ablaze with fire that could not break.\n\nYet, though betrayal wounds so deep and true,\nThe bond of truth may yet endure,\nFor love and loyalty, though often true,\nMay rise again from ashes, stronger, newerâ€”\nA testament to strength that none can beat."
