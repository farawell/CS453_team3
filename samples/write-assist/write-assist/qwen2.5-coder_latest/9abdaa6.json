  "output": "'Twas on a midnight dark and stormy night,  \nA daring knight arose from his bed’s soft plight.  \nWith sword in hand, he sought the dragon’s den,  \nWhere many brave had once been vanquished again.\n\nThe cave was deep, its darkness deep as night,  \nWith walls that cracked and stalactites that shone like light.  \nThe knight's heart raced with fear and dread,  \nFor who would venture where the dragons tread?\n\nBut yet he went, his courage bold and bright,  \nFor honor bound him, and a quest to fulfill.  \nHe crept through tunnels, ever deeper and more grim,  \nUntil at last he stood face to face with the beast that was king.\n\nAnd lo! There sat the dragon, fierce and grand,  \nWith scales of gold and wings that beat in endless sand.  \nIts eyes blazed like fire, its breath a searing flame,  \nYet still the knight stood, his resolve unwaveringly grand.\n\nHe spoke not words of threats or hollow lies,  \nFor he knew that strength alone could do him right.  \nWith one mighty strike, his sword made contact with the beast,  \nAnd down fell the dragon, vanquished at last.\n\nThe knight emerged victorious, his heart content,  \nFor valor won where fear had reigned before.  \nAnd in the morning light, he carried the dragon’s prize,  \nA symbol of bravado, and a story that would never die."
