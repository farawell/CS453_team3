  "actualOutput": "Upon a midnight dreary, as tempests rage,\nA spirit, pale and ghostly, approached thy stage.\nIt spoke with sorrowful lament and sighs so deep,\n\"Alas, my friend! A woe upon thee I weep.\"\nThou hast been wronged, it said, in love by one who hath betrayed,\nAnd seeks to haunt thy home until justice is at last paid.\n\nThrough thickets of darkness and shadows it crept,\nIts form almost invisible, yet unmistakable.\nWith hollow voice it called for vengeance and retribution,\n\"Unravel the plot that hath undone thee and me!\"\n\nThou art beset by fears both real and imagined,\nFor the ghost doth haunt thy dreams with its lamented grudge.\nBut know this, my friend! Do not despair and yield to despair,\nFor truth shall prevail where falsehood doth confide.\n\nSeek out the root of the mischief that has been wrought,\nUncover the villain's hand and lay it low.\nWith courage and honor, do thou face thy fears,\nAnd banish the spirit with justice and tears.\n\nLet not this ghostly visitation haunt thy days,\nFor truth shall set thee free from its dark maze.\nSo, gather thy strength and boldness of heart,\nAnd through the fog of fear, let light shine bright and art.",
