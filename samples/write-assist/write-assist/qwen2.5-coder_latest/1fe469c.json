  "output": "Upon the deck of a vessel at sea,\nWhere salty mist blows and waves rise high.\nWith sturdy hands, I do till the plow,\nAnd brave the storms that come with the flow.\n\nI have sailed on the open blue,\nThrough summer suns and winter's hue.\nMy heart hath grown tough as the old oak in hold,\nAnd I've faced dangers, both great and bold.\n\nThe salty brine in my mouth,\nAs I gaze out over vast waters of doubt.\nBut yet, there is joy in this seafaring life,\nWhere freedom flows like a steady river.\n\nSo let me continue to set forth on the seas,\nWith the wind at my back, and my spirit's free.\nFor though the road may be long and hard,\nI'll always find solace within the old hands of art.\n\n(Chorus)\nS"
