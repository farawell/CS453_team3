I ruled with power and grace,\nMy heart was pure as the morning’s hush.\nBut fate hath dealt me a cruel hand,\nAnd I now lie in decay.\"\n\nIn his youth he rode through fields of gold,\nHis enemies at bay, his soldiers bold.\nWith sword and shield he fought for peace,\nDefending those who could not defend themselves. \n\nBut pride hath led him down this path,\nHe thought himself untouchable by death's wrath.\nSo when the day arrived, the hour came true,\nFate struck him down with unerring grace.\n\nNow lies he on a cold stone in chains,\nOnce mighty, now nothing but a name.\nHis enemies laugh at his downfall,\nAnd mock his fall from glory’s pale dawn."
