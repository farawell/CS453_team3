  "output": "Upon a fair morning light,\nA humble knight arose to meet his plight.\nWith armor on his back and sword by his side,\nHe sought adventure in lands untold and wide.\n\nThou hast heard oft of quests most bold,\nOf knights who fought against dragons' breath, bold.\nBut this knight's quest was none so great\nAs the recovery of a lost treasure that shone with sapphire's light.\n\nIn distant realms where forests deep and dark,\nLay hidden treasures that no man had discovered for centuries.\nWith a heart full of courage and hand steady,\nHe rode forth to claim the prize, if he could.\n\nBut as he journeyed, danger drew near,\nAnd foes arose to test his will and prowess so dear.\nThrough mountains high and valleys deep and wide,\nHe faced many battles, some fierce and some light.\n\nAlas, he faltered not, but fought with valorous might,\nFor the treasure was worth the cost of his life, if must be paid.\nWith a final blow, he vanquished all that stood in his way,\nAnd claimed the prize, a sapphire so bright.\n\nFrom that day forth, his name was sung and told,\nOf the knight who faced danger and fought with bold.\nAnd though his quest was won at great cost,\nHis heart remained true to the cause of right.\n\nSo let us remember, dear friend, this tale most dear,\nOf a knight's quest that was full of fear and cheer."
