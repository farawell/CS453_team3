  "actualOutput": "Upon a midnight's dream, as stars did twinkle with celestial grace, there emerged from the heart of Albion a valiant knight, Sir Cedric. His quest was not that of earthly treasure but rather one of valor and honor. It was whispered among the courts and taverns that a great evil lurked in the North, corrupting the land with darkness and tyranny.\n\nSir Cedric, with armor gleaming under moonlight and spirit unwavering, set forth his steed at dawn, his heart heavy yet filled with righteous determination. He rode through barren landscapes, forests dark as the night, until he came upon a village scarred by the presence of the beast.\n\n\"Who seeks to pass?\" asked the village elder, his eyes watching over the intruder warily.\n\n\"I am Sir Cedric,\" the knight replied with confidence, \"and I bear the quest of honor. What is the name of this beast?\"\n\n\"It is known as the Wraith,\" the elder shuddered, \"a creature that feeds on fear and darkness.\"\n\nSir Cedric drew his sword, a weapon forged in whispers of old, and charged towards the heart of the village. The battle was fierce, the air thick with magic and steel, but Sir Cedric's courage knew no bounds.\n\nIn a climactic encounter, he faced the Wraith itselfâ€”a dark shadow that seemed to defy mortal eyes. With a final, mighty thrust of his sword, Sir Cedric pierced the heart of the beast, banishing its terror from the land.\n\nReturning victorious, Sir Cedric was hailed as a hero. The people of Albion celebrated his valor and righteousness, knowing that he had protected them with honor and might.\n\nAnd so, Sir Cedric's quest was not just to slay the Wraith but also to reaffirm the virtues of courage, loyalty, and justice in the face of darkness. For in the heart of every man lies a hero, waiting for the call of duty and the courage to rise.",
