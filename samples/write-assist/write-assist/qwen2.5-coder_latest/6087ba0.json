Aye, parting is inevitable,  \nYet in thy eyes I see a love that'll last.\n\nThou art my sun, my moon, my guiding light,  \nMy anchor through life's tumultuous night.  \nWith every dawn and twilight, let us be true  \n\nEven as thou art compelled to leave for thee\n\nSo let this parting be but a sweet farewell,  \nA token of love that'll forever dwell.  \nThou art a treasure to me, though we must say goodbye\nBeshrew the heavens that we cannot stay together all our days.",
