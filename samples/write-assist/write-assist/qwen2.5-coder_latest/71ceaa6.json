  "output": "Upon the fields of amber gold,\nWhere leaves do dance in twilight's hold,\nAutumn whispers soft and slow,\nOf beauty in each fading show.\n\nThe sun doth set with golden hue,\nA canvas painted by the sea.\nThe trees do bear their fruitful crop,\nIn verdant shades that time doth cope.\n\nOh, how I marvel at this scene,\nWhere nature's artistry doth gleam.\nThe forest floor is strewn in gold,\nLike stars that fall from heaven's fold.\n\nSo let us bask in this ethereal light,\nWhere joy and beauty intertwine.\nFor autumn's fleeting splendor brightens\nOur hearts with memories yet to be sown."
