  "actualOutput": "Upon the tempestuous seas, our vessel did meet with direst woe, a shipwreck that hath left us in dire straits. Thus was I cast adrift upon the waters, amidst the howling wind and crashing waves.\nAs the vessel's timbers began to give way, cries of terror rang out as the sailors fought to save their lives. But alas, it was but a vain endeavor, for the ship had been swept away by the fierce elements.\nAlone upon the ocean's vast expanse, I wandered aimlessly for many days and nights until I stumbled upon a small island. There I found shelter from the raging storm, but little else save for meager provisions and a sense of despair.\nAs the days dragged on, my strength began to wane and my spirit to falter. But then, to my great amazement and joy, I spied a ship in the distance, coming towards the island upon the horizon.\nWith heart filled with hope, I hailed the vessel's crew, imploring them to save me from this dire plight. And lo! They did, rescuing me from the clutches of the tempest and bringing me back to safety once more.\nThou hast heard my story in the words of Shakespeare, a tale of woe and triumph alike. Let it be a reminder that though we may be cast upon rocky shores, there is always hope for rescue and redemption.",
