For victory doth come, a tale most grand,\nWhere valor hath triumphed o'er the land.\nA hero's heart beats strong and true,\nWith sword in hand, he fights with all his hue.\n\nUpon the field where swords did clash,\nIn battles fought 'neath starry night,\nThe victor stood not timid but bold,\nWith eyes that saw beyond the fold.\n\nFor victory doth not know defeat,\nBut rises from the darkest of nights.\nO'er hills and valleys, victory sweeps,\nBringing peace and honor wherever it peeps.\n\nSo hail the victor, mightiest of men,\nWhose courage and valor will forever enchant.\nLet trumpets sound and banners wave,\nAs we sing of triumph in every land."
