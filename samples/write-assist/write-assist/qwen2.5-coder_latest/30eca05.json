Thou art as shadows fly,\nAnd leaveth but a hollow sigh.\n\nOh, how I yearn to hold thee near,\nTo comfort thee and stanch thy fear.\nBut thou art gone, and with thee gone\nAll hope of joy doth seem to be flown.\n\nSo let me weep for love's sweet fate,\nAnd mourn the loss that hath made me hate.\nFor though thy love may come again,\nMy heart doth ache with every pain.",
