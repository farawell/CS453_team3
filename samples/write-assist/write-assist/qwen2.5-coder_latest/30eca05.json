  "output": "Ah, Love! So sweet, yet fickle and untrue,\nA rose in spring that fades to winter's hue.\nThou art like moonbeams on the darkest night,\nGuiding us with light, yet dimming in the sight.\n\nO, how I do lament our love's untimely end,\nWhen beauty fades and leaves our hearts bereft of tend.\nOur eyes do weep, our hearts do ache for thee,\nFor thou wast all that could make life complete.\n\nBut now we find ourselves alone once more,\nThy memory a phantom in the air.\nOur souls are torn asunder by thy departure,\nAnd though we grieve, our hearts will never despair.\n\nSo let us cherish memories of thee,\nA love lost, but eternal and free.\nFor even though thou art no longer near,\nThou shalt always be remembered with great dear."
