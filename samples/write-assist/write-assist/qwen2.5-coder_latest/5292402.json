  "actualOutput": "The King Doth Face a Dilemma\n\nIn lands far removed from madding crowd,  \nA monarch sits upon the throne so grand.  \nHe governs with an iron hand,  \nAnd realms beneath his rule are vast and land.\n\nHis name is known afar and wide,  \nYet none knows him save by his title's stride.  \nFor in his heart, there lies a dilemma deep and dread,  \nA choice that must be made, or worse, it will lead to death.\n\nThe realm is beset with strife and war,  \nAnd people cry for peace, as darkness falls far.  \nYet to make peace, the king must choose his side,  \nTo either fight on, or bow their heads with pride.\n\nHe calls his council close and gathers all around,  \nHis advisors wise, yet each with a different sound.  \nOne speaks of might and power, how to crush the foe and reign supreme,  \nAnother pleads for mercy, saying peace is key.\n\nThe king doth ponder long and deep,  \nAs sleep eludes him in his royal keep.  \nHe ponders not only the realm's fate,  \nBut also his own honor, and how it may be smitten.\n\nFor if he chooses might and power,  \nHis rule shall last but brief and bitter.  \nThe people, once content with peace,  \nShall rise up once again against his capricious race.\n\nYet if he chooses mercy,  \nAnd seeks to make peace at any cost,  \nHe risks the wrath of those who would fight,  \nAnd none can say for sure what might come next.\n\nSo here is the king's dilemma, great and dire,  \nA choice that must be made, or else all will perish.  \nFor in this moment, both paths lead to danger,  \nAnd each one carries with it its own despair.\n\nThe king doth weigh his options once again,  \nAs sleep eludes him and time grows thin.  \nHe ponders not only the realm's fate,  \nBut also his own honor, as how it may be smitten.\n\nFor if he chooses might and power,  \nHis rule shall last but brief and bitter.  \nThe people, once content with peace,  \nShall rise up once again against his capricious race.\n\nYet if he chooses mercy,  \nAnd seeks to make peace at any cost,  \nHe risks the wrath of those who would fight,  \nAnd none can say for sure what might come next.\n\nSo here is the king's dilemma, great and dire,  \nA choice that must be made, or else all will perish.  \nFor in this moment, both paths lead to danger,  \nAnd each one carries with it its own despair.\n\nThe king doth ponder long and deep once more,  \nAs time grows thin and dark surrounds him near.  \nHe doth pray for guidance, from above,  \nTo help him make a choice that will not cause him sorrow.\n\nFor in this moment, both paths lead to danger,  \nAnd each one carries with it its own despair.  \nSo here is the king's dilemma, great and dire,  \nA choice that must be made, or else all will perish.",
