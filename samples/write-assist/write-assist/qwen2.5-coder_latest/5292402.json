  "output": "Aye, my noble friend, what knell hath tolled in our realm? The great King Arthur now standeth on a moral crossroad. His kingdom stands at the brink of war and peace. He must choose between defending his people from an impending invasion or pursuing a treaty with a long-time enemy. \n\nBeware, for such a choice may be dire. If he chooses peace, his realm may suffer from the attacks of the foe. If he chooses war, his people may become weakened under the strain of battle and the loss of life.\n\nAlas, my king, thou art burdened by this choice. Weigh well both sides and choose wisely. For the fate of thy kingdom doth rest in thine hands alone."
