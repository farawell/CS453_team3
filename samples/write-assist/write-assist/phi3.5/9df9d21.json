Thou serpent in my own bosom's guise;  \nDidst thou not see the innocence of eyes so pure?  \nTo think I thought thee kin and kindred soul,  \nAnd now discover such deceitful play at mine expense. \n\nYet Shakespearean verse must tell a tale that grieves:   \n\"Beware; for in fair Verona once more,\" he weaves—    \nA caution of love's own frail and tender chain,  \nWhich when broken by such cruel hands as mine doth cause. \n\nOh may the stars above remember my plight!  \nShall I too fade into oblivion with thee?   \nOr find in sorrow’s depth a strength to glean—     \nA fortress built from grief, though it be but of dreamed nightly ween. \n\nThus speak the verses penned by love's own quill:  \nWithin this heart betrayed and broken still lies;    \nTo seek a peace not found in fickle bonds or sweet deceit—   \nA quest for solace 'midst Shakespearean sorrow’s sea.
