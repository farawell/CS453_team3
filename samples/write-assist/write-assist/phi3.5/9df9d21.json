  "actualOutput": "In shadows deep where trust once did dwell so fair,  \nA wicked plot hath unfurled with venomous sting.  \nThou friend turned traitor's cloak doth bear a foul air,  \nAnd in deceit I find my heart is pining for.\n\nForsook the light of loyalty that once shone brightly within thy breast,  \nReplaced by dark designs as nefarious plots take flight.  \nOh woe betwixt thee and me! Oh love now lost in sin;  \nA trusted soul hath cast aside its honorable bonds for greedy gain.\n\nFrom lofty heights where friendship once did soar, descend I must—  \nFor guilt doth weigh heavy on mine own conscience sore.   \nBetrayal's bitter fruit has left a taste of sorrow deep and true;  \nA stab to my core as shattered glass within the storm-toss sea view.\n\nThou art now but shadow, cast by fouler night’s deceitful gleam—  \nTheir treacherous act hath turned thy face into spectre'd shame.   \nOh cruel jest! How could I bear this bitter dream?    \nWhere once was friendship as pure and sweet refrain of love in tune, now but woeful mournsome song drowned by night’s crooning moan:  \n\"Trust thou me or lose thee to the gambit's silent storm.\" \n\nSo here I stand betwixt despairing tears and rackéd bone;   \nBereft of peace, a heart once cherished now left alone.  \nIn Shakespeare’s style so lush with sorrow scribed—    \nA tale most tragic where the human soul is stripped: Betrayal'd by those we trusted close and true!",
