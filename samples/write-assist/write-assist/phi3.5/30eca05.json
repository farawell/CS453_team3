  "output": "In fair Verona's glowing light once lay my heart enwrapped in thine embrace so dearly sweet,  \nA love as deep and vast as Neptuneâ€™s domain did I cherish till fate dealt a bitter beat.   \nBut alas! What cruel twist of Fate doth make our souls no longer entwined?       \nThou wert the sun my day sought to mirror, now thou art naught but shadowed night unkind.    \n\nWherefore should I grieve for lost love or languish in bitter tears and sighs so softly cast,  \nWhen Cupid's arrows missed their mark did fly; left me a memory of thee steadfast?       \nWith heavy heart shall sorrow paint its shades upon this canvas named my soul.   \nSuch deep pangs that rend the chest with yearning for you to make amends and whole, oh noble goal!      \n\nNow art thou as distant stars in heaven's vast expanse untouchable from our earthly berth  \nThe love I bore so tender now turned into a ghost of what once was worth.    \nI pray thee look upon my sorrow with pity; for lost is the beloved that had been true and dear,      \nA heart in torment yearns to bridge this gap ere time turns all things new each passing yesteryear.     \n  \nHeed not these words of lamentation penned beneath a tear-streaked sky so vast;    \nFor love once lost can heal with sweet reminiscence, and memories made that shall long outlast!   \nLend thine ear to silent echoes carried on the wings of whispering winds at night.     \nIn dream's soft light may find closure mine heart in gentle surrender take flight.    \n  \nSo hear my plea beneath these sorrowful verses; let this tale not end here and there,   \nBut rather bid adieu with hope that we might soon be reunited fair:          \nA love lost hath turned to loss profoundly felt within the depths of mine own soul.       \nPerchance time may mend what once was broken so I can play a fuller role!  \n```quill``"
