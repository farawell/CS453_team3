  "actualOutput": "When Cupid's bow hath left my heart bereft of light,  \nAnd love that once did bloom now falls to night,   \nI find myself adrift in sorrow’s sea,  \nWhere hearts entwined no longer wish me.    \n\nForsooth! What cruel twist of fate so grave?  \nThat the warmth I sought from thee should save not but wave on crestless waves alone; thy presence now akin to dream at dawn's first light.   \nThou, once my muse and reason bright, hath turned into shade quite blacke’d blight—no longer part of life's sweet rite!  \n\nOh love lost in time’s cruel flight ‘bove the years I yearned so tight; thy memory haunteth day by dismal night.   \nIn sorrow deep where once did joy abound, now silence reigns with heavy sound. Once cherished glance and tender touch no longer found within my grasp nor heart's hollow bound—  \nAlas! To love thou hast left me not just bereft of mirth but voided entirely from all earthly worth.    \n\nThou art the missing star in sky so vast, now extinguished; thy voice once sweet hath ceased to last.   \nEach word I long for thee doth sound amiss—my heart a prison without release or remission:  \nFor love lost like whispers of wind that chill and flee.    \n\nYet hope within me still may flicker faint, entreating heaven’s kind mercy to outlast this woeful pantomime; for though thee be distant as the moon from sighted shore—   \nPerchance one day in yonder future we shall meet anon and mend what sorrow sought so ruthlessly.  \nBut till then, I must brave solitude’s harsh decree alone ‘gainst hope'd heartache moan; a lovelorn bard bereft of sweet refrain!    \nFor love lost is but the deepest wound we bear—and my soul with heavy tears doth suffer its share.   \n\nSuch pangs I carry 'cross each day,  \nClinging to memories like ships at bay; they sail not into harbor's calm embrace, nor find sweet rest in sea’s tranquil space:    \nFor love lost is the ache within—the ghost that clings and ne'er shall be undone.   \nThough I yearn for thee with aching sigh; long may my heart not forget its bye!  \nTo have adored, to hold dear what once was bright: oh how can time restore the stolen night?    \nFor love lost amain it clings—that cruel thief of happiness and being.   \nYet in this sorrow deepened plight I hope for solace found within my heart's own rampart;  \nTo cherish still that which we shared, ere time severed its part: the ghostly imprint on every pulsing art!    \nFor love lost—yet not forgotten entirely. For in this loss a chance to feel what once was tender and whole may rise again with future’s golden bell;  \nAnd thus I pray for healing balm, lest my own heart's hollow chamber grows too large:   \nTo mend the wound of love lost beneath heaven vast—in hopeful dreamer one day to find repast.",
