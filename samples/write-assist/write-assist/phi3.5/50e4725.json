  "actualOutput": "Upon a night so still and dreary, where the moon hid behind veils of grim clouds, there in the ancient halls of Thornfield Manor did Lady Eliza find herself engaged with tales most eerie. Amidst whispered secrets shared by flickering candlelights that danced upon dust-laden tomes and timeworn portraits on mildewed walls – a presence, ethereal as the mist itself, made her uneasy company in silence profound.\n\nThe Lady stood alone within these aged chambers with naught but shadows for counsellors; yet it was not mere darkness that stole upon Eliza's senses so keenly since a phantom figure seemed to trace the edges of reality therein. This apparition, cloaked in remnants of its mortal garb and bearing neither name nor countenance save for an uncanny resemblance to her late husband Lord Ashford – did it seem as though fate conspired here within these solemn stones?\n\nEliza's heart thundered with trepidation, yet curiosity sparkled in darker waters. \"Who are you?\" she implored into the void where breath might have been heard before death rendered silence absolute to this spectral courtship of her mind’s eye; but hark! A voice as soft and melancholy twined through air thick with yesteryear's perfumes, replying in tones that murmured secrets meant only for night-haunted ears:\n\n\"Thou hast been summoned here by mine own essence – a remembrance cast into shades of afterlives untold; to seek solace where once I trod upon Thornfield's verdant knoll and through whispering pines, beneath the watchful eye o’er hilltop so grand.\"\n\nEliza felt each syllable drawn from within her soul – a remembrance of days when Lord Ashford roamed these lands with eyes agleam for life beyond. Yet now he dwelled betwixt two worlds; here she sat, his earthbound kin seeking refuge in the gentle caress 'pon mortal coils no longer hers to bear alone:\n\n\"Thou art not mere apparition,\" quoth Lady Eliza with wonderment spilling forth like rivers meet ocean deep. \"For thou hast traversed thine own path betwixt this realm and next, now seeking audience in mine untimely hour.\"\n\nThe spirit's form wavering as if bathed by an otherworldly light – it spoke of love immortal, a bond transcending death: \"Lay not thy heart to weary woe for our fates entwine; where thou art here beside me midst ancient stone and time forgotten. I seek but respite from spectral chains that bind.\"\nIn these words laid bare was yearning's plea, as though Lord Ashford himself had found sanctuary within this ghostly visitation: a chance to be reunited with love not lost nor forgot; rather intertwined eternally through memories cherished and silent wishes unspoken.\n\nLady Eliza felt her own heart swell at the prospect offered – for though time hath turned its tireless wheel ever onward, there remains no greater testament than two souls forever linked across dimensions: one living beneath sun’s radiant glow; 'twixt shadow and moonbeam intertwined with spectral silhouette.\n\nAnd so in the ensuing hours they would convene upon Thornfield's grounds, where Lady Eliza bore witness to an otherworldly communion – as both mortal kinship rekindled by love remembered past yet never ceasing its tender embrace within their shared remembrance: a ghost and his living counterpart finding unity in spectral passage through time’s ethereal expanse.\n\nFor what are we if not mere vessels for memories cherished, where life's precious moments meld into afterlives untold – love transcending even death itself; forever binding two souls within its tender grasp? Thus did phantom Lord Ashford cross Thornfield Manor’s threshold betwixt world and next: his visitation not an end but rather a continuance of their shared legacy, woven into the fabric stretched across eternity's loom.\n\nThus concluded Lady Eliza’s encounter with fellowship beyond realms – where spirits like Lord Ashford roamed freely 'twixt shadows and light; reminders we are but fleeting custodians of memories cherished, evermore entwined through love immortal: a connection unbroken by death's decree.\n",
