  "output": "In lands of old where virtues we hold dear,  \nA maiden fair doth bloom each year.  \nWith grace and chastity her heart is rife,  \nCultivating purest beauty in life.\n\nHer virtue like a lily white stands tall,  \nUnshaken by temptations’ siren call.  \nIn silent strength she weaves through daylight's gold thread,  \nA beacon of goodness and honor instead.\n\n“Sweet maiden,” saith the bard with heavy heart, “thou art true to part;   \nThy chastity’s cloak wraps thee as my own devotion.”    \nFor what greater love could there exist than this—  \nA lady's virtue 'gainst worldly seduction.\n\nAttend! For her the Bard has etched a verse divine,   \nHer beauty not in mere form doth shine; but virtuous mind so fine:    \n“Fair maiden fair and wise beyond thy years,”  \nCalls out our playwright beneath his moonlit tears. \n\nIn thee we find the essence of what’s right,   \nA paragon in morning's gentle light—   \nThine honor serves as a timeless guide:    \nAdorned with virtue that shall never slide.  \n\nSo hear this tale before it ends here;   \nOf virtuous maiden and her saintly spear —   \nCut through the fog of vanity, pride's lies so sly—   \nFor true character can no mean nor trifle defy.    \n\nThus exalt thee in song we shall sing out clear:  \nThe embodiment of what’s virtuous and dear;     \nMay thy purest form be ever known to all,  \nIn Shakespearian echoes that never fall."
