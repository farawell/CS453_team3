  "actualOutput": "In days of yore, when valorous deeds were sung and tales spun with fervent breath, there was a goodly Knight named Sir Alistair. Clad in mail as dark as the raven midnight sky yet eyes alight like stars that guide sailors from afar, he embarked upon a quest most dire—a journey of honor to reclaim what had been lost and bring peace unto his troubled land.\n\nSir Alistair didst arise with morn's first light when the rooster crowed thrice ere sun kissed horizon fair; steadfast in purpose, he saddled noble steed Pegasus—a creature of pure heart whose hooves trod paths unseen and heard only by moonbeams.\n\nThe knight didst venture forth through forests deep where shadows play'th tricks upon one’s senses; over mountains jagged that would pierce the heavens themselves—yet Sir Alistair, with courage as his shield against fear and doubt within this formidable heart of ironclad will.\n\nPassed he did fields sown by diligent hands yet fallow for want of laughter's chime; through towns where chimney’d roof topped whisper tales untold—each step, a sonnet strung along the weft and warp of destiny so boldly woven.\n\nNoble Sir Alistair faced beasts both foul and fell at his side: griffins with eyes agleam like orbs that doth seek truth beneath feathered guise; wyverns whose scales shimmer'd silver, glint of justice held within their fiery maw.\n\nThus he ventured ever onward till into the foulest abyss—a lair wherein dwelt dragon dreadsome: its breath did rage like summer storm upon fair knightly form; scales as forked lightning danced with threat of death's own scornful norm.\n\nBut lo! With lance polished to mirror sheen and sword sharpened on whetstone so keen, Sir Alistair charged forth without fear - his voice rang out like clarion call: \"Foul beast retreat!\" His very deeds bespos’d valor unmatch'd in time immemorial.\n\nAnd therewith clashing steel met scale did fierce battle wage—each strike but verse within epic penned; until, with triumphant roar and flame extinguished by his armor staunchly brac’t against such heat as none could dare impart: Sir Alistair stood alone amidst the smolder'd remnant of beast.\n\nHis quest was done—an odyssey wrought not with sword but truth; he returned home bearing heavy crown and heart alight, forever changing course for land once lost to sorrow’s spiteful wroth now blessed anew by heroic might: Sir Alistair the Knight so bold.",
