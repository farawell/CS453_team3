In times of old when chivalry reigned supreme,\nAnd knights roamed free like beams of golden dream.\nWith lances high and hearts in purest love entwined,\nThey pledged their troth to honor unconfined.\n\n(Chorus)\nOh sing thee a song of gallant devotion’s dance,\nWhere ladies fair did cast enamoured glance.\nIn chivalrous courts where virtue was the throne,\nEach suitor strived not alone but in commune.\n\n(Verse 2)\nWith silken threads and whispers soft as dove'd wings,\nThey courted true with tender love that sings.\nNo thrust nor sword did mar these holy quests,\nBut gentle touches met by lovely maid’s breast.\n\n(Chorus)\nOh sing thee a song of gallant devotion’s dance,\nWhere ladies fair did cast enamoured glance.\nIn chivalrous courts where virtue was the throne,\nEach suitor strived not alone but in commune.\n\n(Bridge)\nForsooth, no blemish could their love betray;\nWith every word and action they’d convey respect for thee each day.\nThey bore themselves as knights ought to bear:\nCourage brightly shining through despair's dark air.\n\n(Chorus)\nOh sing thee a song of gallant devotion’s dance,\nWhere ladies fair did cast enamoured glance.\nIn chivalrous courts where virtue was the throne,\nEach suitor strived not alone but in commune.\n\n(Outro)\nSo here I recount with quill and flourishing script,\nThe love of courtly hearts that time could never slip.\nRemember ye this: when chivalry's song is sweet as honey nectar’d flowered greets their tale to the next generation; for in our history pages are writ anon all these brave deeds with grace and gallantry, not by sword but pure heartbeats of love.\n\n(Chorus)\nOh sing thee a song of gallant devotion's dance,\nWhere ladies fair did cast enamoured glance.\nIn chivalrous courts where virtue was the throne,\nEach suitor strived not alone but in commune.",
