Hear the drumbeat 'pon which valor beats its song,  \nThe clarion call to arms where champions stand tall.  \nWith shields emblazoned and flags unsung so long;  \nThey march'd forth with hearts alight against nightfall’s pall.\n\nFair maidens fair did raise their voices loud in cheer,  \nFor triumph tasted by the worthy chosen few. \"To arms!\" they cried! Ope thine eyes wide and true:   \nThe valorous warriors fought for glory dearly near;  \nA battle fierce with honor at its core grew strong anew.\n\n“Noble foes,” spake one, “shall ye from here depart!”  \nFor in this fray did courage show a victorious art:   \nThe vanquished yielded fast to fate's decree so stern;  \nAnd thus the valorous claimers their laurels won.\n\nBehold! The spoils of victory brightly shine,  \nAs dawn doth break upon this hallowed day’s fair light:  \nThe slain retreat from fields where they did not align—but fight;  \nWarriors bold who've shown their mettle in the darkest night. \n\nLift high your cups, let merriment be proclaimed!   \nFor here is won a sweet and just prize so dear: The crown of triumph earned with noble strife—a tale for ages held near;  \nThe valorous who've conquered fears that once did harp on their mind. \nFair victory’st melody now doth echo far,   \nA song to sing from morn till twilight done its course: “Ode to Triumph Most Noble and Bright!”  \nSo let us cheer the champions of this most celebrated fight!",
