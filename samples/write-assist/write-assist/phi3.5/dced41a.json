  "actualOutput": "When skies above in anger do turn and thunder roars its displeasure deep,  \nAnd tempests rage with howling wind that tears through earthly bower so steep;  \nBehold! The mighty Zeus doth cast his fury broad upon the land,  \nAs Nature's wrath in full display makes every mortal stand.\n\nForsook by gentle rain and sun’s warm caress of day,   \nThe verdant fields now tremble 'neath despairing gray array;  \nWhere once did dance flowers basked, they quiver as leaves might fall –  \nNature's mighty tears shed heavy at the wrathful storm's call.\n\nOft hath Gaia shown her strength when tempests fiercely rage,    \nAnd mountains crumble 'neath relentless torrential page;   \nThe streams once pure and full of life now run with bitter sorrow –  \nNature’s wrath unveiled in fury'layers deepest power.\n\nYet within this chaos born from nature’s vengeful heart,    \nLie lessons steeped clear; we must learn to partake and smartly start:   \nTo cherish every bough that shelters us beneath the sky –  \nRespect all living things before our pride might fly too high. \n\nFor though nature’s wrath may rage, fierce as thunder'd Bard could say -    \nRemember this; her love doth mend what we oft dismay:   \nWith humble hearts and tender care – repentance sown  \nIn fertile soil of remorse from seeds once overgrown.",
