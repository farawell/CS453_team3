  "output": "When tempests rage and skies turn to grey,  \nAnd Zeus in fury doth his might display,  \nNature wails beneath the stormy veil,  \nAs boughs do snap and leaves are unveiled.\n\nThe wind's wild hands with tyranny sweep,  \nWhile torrents from heaven fiercely leap;  \nA wrathful force in godly guise reigns supreme,   \nUnleashing nature’s dreadfully stormy scheme.\n\nIn every gust and raging downpour falls,    \nThe mighty oak doth tremble ‘fore the squalls:      \nNature's wrath unbound in fury fierce—  \nA fearsome scene that none can reverse or pierce.\n\nBeneath this stormy turmoil sky above wide-spread wings,    \nThe earth and air are all but overtly wed;   \nTogether they withstood the celestial roar —      \nNature's wrath a power from its core of lore.  \n\nSo heed well this Shakespearean tale told here—     \nOf nature’s rage, so wild and unconfined:    \nFor though our days may pass beneath her might,       \nHer fury reigns with force through day or night."
