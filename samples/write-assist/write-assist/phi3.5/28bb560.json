Attend the tale of valor great and pure,  \nOf a knight who from his exile did emerge.  \nWith heart afire 'neath heaven’s watchful eye,  \nReturned he to mine own hearth yonder hence.\n\n(Chorus)\nHero returns! With armor shining bright and bold,   \nThrough thorny paths of war hath tread ahead.    \nFrom distant lands where sorrow oft was sown, \nBack now comes the champion known to all in his township’s fold.  \n\n(Verse 2)\nOnce vanquished by fate's cruel hand so swift,   \nThe gallant soul hath braved tempests fierce and deep,    \nYet 'cross such trials he still doth not waver nor falter;     \nTo reclaim his place in mine honor’s keep.  \n\n(Bridge)\nOh! The tales that will be spun by bards afar   \nOf this night when valor won, and fear did yield its curtain call—    \nA hero's return to where love once was cherished so dearly upon his name:     \nFor in each heartbeat echoes the chime of homecoming’s sweet refrain. \n\n(Chorus)  \nHero returns! With armor shining bright and bold,    \nThrough thorny paths of war hath tread ahead—   \nFrom distant lands where sorrow oft was sown,     \nBack now comes the champion known to all in his township’s fold. \n\n(Outro)  \nSo hear ye this song as stars above do twinkle bright!    \nOf heroes and their homeward bound flight—   \nFor every night shall honor our tale retold,     \nAnd sing of valiant souls returning to yon delightful light."
