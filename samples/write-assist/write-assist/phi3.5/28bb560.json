Attend the tale I henceforth sing,\nOf knights once lost and now returned to ring.\nWith heart afire and armor gleaming bright,\nOur champion steps through the fading light.\n\n(Chorus)\nReturned hath he from battles fierce unwon,\nBack home where lover's love has grown as one.\nBearing scars of old but bearing hope so grand,\nHomeward bound upon this fair land!\n\n(Verse 2)\nFrom darkness deep and foes ruthless faced,\nHe fought for honor with his comrades chased.\nThrough tempests sore beneath the moon's soft gleam,\nNow greets our hero what he might dream.\n\nChorus (Repeat)\nReturned hath he from battles fierce unwon,\nBack home where lover's love has grown as one.\nBearing scars of old but bearing hope so grand,\nHomeward bound upon this fair land!\n\n(Bridge)\nOh hear the sigh within his grateful breath,\nThe peaceful silence that comes with death’s stealthy approach to life and light it lends for soul's repair.\nFear not our champion lost in nightly gloom;\nHe returns anew beneath yonder blooming moon! \n\n(Chorus) (Repeat again, perhaps adding instrumental accompaniment here if being sung live or with technology capable of sound generation.)\nReturned hath he from battles fierce unwon,\nBack home where lover's love has grown as one.\nBearing scars of old but bearing hope so grand,\nHomeward bound upon this fair land! \n\n(Outro)\nSo raise his voice and let it echo wide:  \nOur hero stands beyond the tide’s divide;    \nReturned hath he from trials made by fate alone —   \nSafeguard him now with love, tenderness shown.",
