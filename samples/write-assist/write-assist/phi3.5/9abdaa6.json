  "actualOutput": "In the heart of ancient realms where shadows cast their long and fearsome silhouette upon earthen hillocks, there resided a mighty wyrm whose scaly hide did gleam 'neath sunlight rare. The dragon's lair, hidden by guile from prying eyes mortal or divine alike, lay beneath the mountain's stern and stoic brow—a cavernous chamber of wondrous splendour wherein gold glinted like stars amidst a night sans moon.\n\nBrave souls oft whisper tales 'bout this fearsome creature whose fiery breath could forge new peaks, yet within its lair dwells not just beast but mystery wrapped in scales of olden lore—a guardian most solemn and true to the secrets it keeps as if entrusted unto itself alone.\n\nOur tale unfolds on a day wherein knight errant sought his fortune 'mongst these lands, venturing ever closer towards that fabled den beneath Peak's mighty spine—hear ye not of him nor name but know he dared with courage most brave and heart unyielding.\n\nHark! For as the gallant knight did approach his goal at twilight’s last gleaming, there came an awe-inspiring sight before th'eyes: vast expanse of darkness where once dragon made its den—so deep within earth doth it reside now. With sword in hand and resolve as mighty oak against tempest gale did our champion enter into the fathomless abyss below, his every step a testament to mortal endurance amidst trials most dire.\n\nThrough winding passageways he ventured hence until at last came face-to-face with scales of crimson and gold; whereupon visions seemed not but mere fantasy spun by bard's own tongue—a creature sovereign, majestic indeed! The wyrm’s cry tolled like thunder 'cross the mountains whilst fire danced upon its maw as if twilight itself bore witness here.\n\nYet beholden bravely stood our knight ere trembling knees nor faltering heart; for though beasts of legend oft strike with wrath born from primal urge, this noble soul perceived the essence within—that which binds guardian to gemstones hoard: a love pure and steadfast more fierce than any flame ablaze.\n\n\"Noble wyrm,\" said he in solemn tones soft as silken scarf 'gainst winter's bite, \"thy majesty hath caught mine eyes; yet know that I wander not for gold nor glory born from such conquest—but rather seek connection deeper still than any treasure trove could hold.\"\n\nAnd lo! In solemn silence did the dragon ponder 'pon words so sincere and tender, till at length a spark within its ancient breast took flight anew. With scales that shimmered like jeweled crowns upon fair maidens' heads; wings unfurling as if basking betwixt dawn’s first light—the dragon revealed not fierce wrath but gentle understanding:\n\n\"In thine own heart lies truth, bold knight. Though mine duty is to guard what wealth hath brought me hither from distant lands afar; knowest thou that love's tender touch oft outshines all riches within my lair.\" \n\nThus did they part—a man and beast once feared as foe now found kinship midst the mountain’se olden walls whereupon lay secrets untold. A bond formed 'twixt dragon's might, knight errant courageous spirit; together their story shall echo through ages henceforth—a reminder that even in realms of myth and legend truth abides: Love conquers all fearsome beasts both great or small within our hearts alike.\n",
