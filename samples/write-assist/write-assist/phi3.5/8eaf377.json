I wouldst bask in your gentle light,      \nTill day succumbs to velvet blackness of eternal night.     \n  \nSo let us together dance 'neath lunar lore's delight;    \nForsooth we find a love that shines so bright—   \nIn thee and thou alone doth my heart take flight,      \nEnraptured by the moon’s own soft silvery light.",
