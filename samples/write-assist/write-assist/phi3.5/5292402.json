  "actualOutput": "Upon the realms of old and verdant fields so wide, there reigned a King fair with visage broad and kind. Yet within his heart lay turmoil deep-seated; for he faced a choice that would shape both present times and future years to come – one such as none other had ever met before in the annals of noble courts:\n\nForsooth, it was whispered through corridors grand - whispers borne on zephyrs' backs. Anon came news from far lands afar; a maiden fair with eyes like sapphires glowing beneath heaven’s gaze did seek the King to wed her hand in marriage bond strong as diamond stone.\n\nYet, for reasons deep and ancient rooted within his lineage's past – an ancestral pact of old - this suitor bore no name but that oft spoken with disdain; a being born not under Caledonian heavens nor amongst kinfolk true to the crown’s legacy. Thus King Aurelius grappled and tossed in mind, whilst stars did twinkle above: shall he bow before such weight of expectation or shall his love's rightful choice lay elsewhere?\n\nWith furrowed brow beneath chin wreathed gold from countless hours under sun’s fierce glare – so oft ruminating what seems an eternity long - the King did decide upon path less trod; for though duty called on every note with urgent sound, his own conscience rang loud and clear above. He chose instead to seek out bonds not bound in blood alone but also knit by spirit’s unbridled thread:\n\nThus he sought counsel 'round table roundly assembled - wise men of great wisdom known far beyond lands' borders; each word spoken echoed like drums through stone halls. They debated at length with fervor fierce, till moon high-heaven bore witness to their spirited parley:\n\n\"Doth not one man’s love transcend mere lineage?\" quoth wise old Mercutio softly; bespectacled and bearded face aglow as he leaned close towards ears of men so gathered. \"Our ruling shall bring forth no harm but instead, set an example for all ages hence: that pure affection’s light outshines rigid roots.\"\n\nAnd thus through consensus came decision made; the King pledged himself not to matrimony's solemn bed with maiden nor suitor whose lineage lay outside his own regal throne. Instead he sought solace in love unchained by ancestry or blood: a bond forged of shared dream and mutual faith, transcendent beyond mere convention’d norm - an endeavor both bold yet noble at heart;\n\nThus spake King Aurelius unto his subjects gathered hitherwithin the palace's grandiose hall – whose very walls did seem to hold whispers old: \"Today I stand before thee not as monarch solely defined by heritage pure, but rather one who shall marry love in its most untamable form. Thus forged anew do my union and mine own kingdom's destiny now intertwine.\"\n\nWith voices raised high above echoes of doubt yet murmured amongst tongues wagging nearby ears – he continued forthwith: \"Mind ye well - that though past hath pledges stern, the future must be remade by courageous hands. Let us all hence join forces to craft together a realm built not on rigid ancestry but instead one where love’s fair wings shall guide our every step!\"\n\nAs words flowed from his lips like sweet nectar spilling forth - soothing even those harshest of skeptic minds – he knew that tomorrow would hold testaments borne by actions brave. For when the sun dips low upon horizon'd edge, its golden rays kissing land with honeyed glow:\n  it shall shine brightly for surety; a new chapter written not in blood alone but through intertwining fates bound only at heartstrings so true and strong they cannot be untied nor ever sever’d. Herein lay King Aurelius' dilemma resolved – an edict fair: to cherish love beyond lineage, for thereby shall we all become truly royalty incarnate under heavenly skies above us grand!\n",
