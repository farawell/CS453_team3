Thy splendor sets the heart ablaze,\nIn thy embrace of change and grace divine.\nWith each falling leaf a tender sonnet’s parting trace,\nThou art nature's own Shakespearean line.\n\n(Verse 2)\nThe breezy whispers carry tales untold,\nOf harvest moons that brightly shine at nightfall.\nIn thy presence we find warmth does hold,\nAnd in each season’s shift feels the might of God's own hand come forth with gallant call.\n\n(Bridge)\nAs daylight wanes and shorter becomes our days,\nThe pumpkin fields yield their famed fruit.\nChilly air carries sweetness that sways—\nA reminder life’s in flux, yet beauty is absolute.\n\n(Chorus)\nOh Autumn! Thy splendor sets the heart ablaze,\nIn thy embrace of change and grace divine.\nThrough Shakespeare's eyes we see our world amaze:\nWhere every season tells a timeless line.\n\n(Outro)\nSo let us celebrate this grand affair, with mirthful hearts aligning—\nTo honor the artistry in nature’s own design and time-bound signifying signs within thine shining shrill so fine!"
