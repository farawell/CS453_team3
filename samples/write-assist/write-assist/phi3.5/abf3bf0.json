  "actualOutput": "In fair Verona where we lay our scene, there once thrived a noble lord of great esteem. His name was Lord Edmund Garrick, whose grace and virtue none could deny or dispute. Yet pride oft breeds folly's seedlings in man’s fertile breast; thus unfold this tragedy dressed within the cloth so finely woven by Fate herself:\n\nLord Edmund had grown arrogant with time as seasons turn, his heart entangled ever more deeply than ivy upon ancient yew. \"I am above reproach,\" he'd proclaim; yet whispers of deceit through hushed corridors found ways to mock such claims and condemn:\n\n\"Look beyond the silvered glass that doth reflect your façade, gentle Lord – for all eyes perceive not but shadows cast by light unjust.\" So pondering heavy upon his soul did these words weigh as leaden chains from which few could flee. Unhearing such counsel in vain he clung to false pride:\n\nBut fortune's wheel, relentless and spinning swiftly henceforth spun cruel twists of irony; a chance encounter with schemers unworthy did lead him down path most dire indeed — betrayal by those whom once held high honor. Alliances fractured like brittle ice beneath the furious surge of tempestuous seas:\n\nBetrayed, his own kin and closest advisor turned their back upon noble lordship's cloak with cold disdain; in darkness they conspired to rob him not merely position but very essence thereof. Such treachery unfolded within whispering walls where once stood trust now lurked malevolent intent:\n\n\"Fools! Foolishness doth lead us astray from wisdom's gentle guidance,\" cried young Lady Abigail, her innocence struck by lightning too harshly for such tender years. Yet even she could not halt the downfall that fate had so cruelty designed — shadows upon Edmund’s legacy were cast wide and deep:\n\nAs days grew shortened to lonely twilight hours when truth must face consequence's stern glare, Lord Garrick stood besieged by doubting minds who questioned every word he spoke. His reputation tarnished beyond salvage; the jewel of his name was sundered stone:\n\n\"I am naught but man! Man doth err,\" sighed Edmund lamenting upon himself — aware that hubris hath been stripped away, leaving him exposed as pariah within society's eyes. Despair crept into every thought; the sun set on his glories past with finality:\n\nFor in this tale where humankind doth showcase both virtue and vice so vividly entwined together like star-crossed Romeo to fair Juliet, let it be known that pride precedes not only fall but also ruinous end. Let Lord Edmund's plight serve as somber reminder – lest others forget:\n\nSo ends our tale of grandeur lost; a noble man who thought himself above reproach fallen hard by his own vanity and unchecked ambition — caution echoing through time for all ears willing to heed its call. May history's pages forevermore carry stern warning, lest others be tempted down same perilous spiral:\n\nTruly then let such sorrowful fable rest within our minds; a tale of tragedy born from man’se own folly and misplaced arrogance — eternal testament to humility's power over hubris. For pride may blind one sight, but wisdom shall illuminate way forward:\n\nFarewell, dear reader! Take heed these words as you wander through life; let them be lantern brightening darkness where ignorant minds might stray astray — lest they too suffer fall that echoes deep within halls of memory everlasting. May providence guide thee safe and true:\n",
