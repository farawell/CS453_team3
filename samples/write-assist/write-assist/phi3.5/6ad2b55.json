  "actualOutput": "Ode to the Bond of True Companionship Most Precious and Deepest Wells\n\nUpon this mortal coil where hearts entwine with threads so fine,  \nLies a bond unseen 'til kindred eyes align.   \nA friendship forged in trials both harsh and keen,    \nWhere laughter rings as clear through turmoils seen.     \n\nBeneath the silvered moon's celestial gleam,    \nTwo souls did meet; a fellowship supreme was born that day within dream whispers of delightful play where spirits freely lay sans care nor fear for night or fray ahead they shared with glee and joy so bright.   \nNo longer shall these tender ties be hidden from the morrow's light,  \nBut nurtured as does a plant reaching out towards sunlight’s height in heavenly sight: firm yet gentle grasp embracing ever steadfast might!    \nSo here I sing of such kinship rare and deep - true friendship that stands against life‘s harshest test while keeping its tender hold near heart's abode secure.     \nFor within our hearts beats unrelentless love for those who stand by us when all else has fled through doors shut tight on hopeful days ahead,  \nThose steadfast friends whose presence never fades though times may change and minds oft stray:    \nThey know the ache of loss yet cheerfully bear it with grace; they hear but don’t judge - offer solace instead as if were divine intervention offered freely by Heaven itself!     \nNoble companions, true to their cause without question or doubt cast upon them – loyalty shines like pearls gleaned from sea so vast and deep:    \nTheir virtue stands against the tempest‘s howling roar; they hold steadfast 'til friendship’s golden thread is spun anew.     \nIn every trial, in sorrow's shadow or joyful day alike – these souls shall ever guide us homeward through life's labyrinthine quest to find:   \nA bond unbroken by time nor tempest‘s rage; enduring as mountains steadfast and tall they are!    \nSo here I raise my voice in song of camaraderie rare – ode dedicated most humbly unto thee, dear friend so loyal across our shared journey through turbulent skies:   \nWorship the bond that ties us hence - remember well each moment spent ‘mongst kindred hearts; cherish everlasting love amid all adversity faced till destiny’s twilight comes when stars align and fate doth bequeath final end. Loyalty bindeth stronger than chain of iron wrought –  \nThus pay tribute always with thanksgreatest reverence:    \nFor within thine eyes gleam hope‘d pure, bright love that forever shines amidst clouds so gray;   \nEternal bond ‘tween two mortals bound by friendship’s grace - an ode sung till final breath drawn silent into void beyond recall.",
