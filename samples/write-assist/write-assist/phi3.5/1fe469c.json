The briny deep doth call upon my soul this eve,\nTo heave anchor and to brave the mighty main.\nOh, Sailor of heart both stout and bold, hear me sing,\nOf seaborne adventures where sea nymphs bring delight.\n\n(Chorus)\nAye, I am a sailor in this vast world's deep blue stage,\nWith sails unfurled to capture the ocean’s rage.\nFrom dawn till dusk beneath heaven's endless gaze,\nIn Shakespearean tongue shall my maritime tales amaze.\n\n(Verse 2)\nTwixt sun and storm I ply with compass worn,\nBy Neptune's whim or fair wind blown.\nWith mast aloft where sky meets ocean’s line,\nMy life is tied in knots of rope o'er brine fine wine.\n\n(Chorus)\nAye, I am a sailor with tales to regale,\nIn deep waters vast as love stories olden tale.\nWith Shakespearean verse and sea salted tongue’s grace, \nI navigate through this aquatic space.\n\n(Bridge)\nThe tempest cries in iambic sorrow found,\nWhilst calm repose doth bring us peace profound.\nMethinks of dear Avon's flowing verse divine,\nAnd hope to echo life as Shakespeare did shine.\n\n(Chorus - Reprise)\nAye! I am a sailor steeped in the artful lore,\nWhere sea meets sky and tales unfurrow more.\nIn style of Bard with every word set free, \nMy salty sonnet sings to thee—with glee.",
