  "actualOutput": "Upon the vast and tempestuous main doth our tale unfurl,  \nOf mariners braving Neptune's wrathful whirl.  \nWith sails unfurled 'gainst a sky so grimly hued grey,   \nA vessel of timber did on fortunes betray. \n\nIn company staid with hopes as high-reaching kites,  \nFound itself amid Neptune's spiteful and foul nights. The sea raged fierce; waves to sky they hurled their mighty crests that blurred the stars in frightened retreat within view of mortal sight so frail. \n\nThe sailors cried out, lost as if on stage without scripted lines or cues:  \n\"Fair Neptune! Cease thy temper's lustful feats!\"   \nYet Poseidon held his court and laughed with spite unkind; the ship did meet its ill fate within watery plight. \n\nIts hull, once proud against briny foam it stood resolute,  \nNow crumbled to remnants 'neath ocean's ravenous suit of sovereign state—a grave in sea bereft! Brave souls adrift amidst Poseidon’s realm subdued where silent whispers tell the tale untold; their valor sung by seafaring bards, through ages old.\n\nSo let us not lament these mariners lost to brine's bitter kiss:  \nTheir spirits dwell in hallowed tales of woe and bliss—the salt-kissed souls who danced with sea’s dark abyss. \nIn Shakespearean verse, we recount the solemn past; a shipwreck story told that shall forever last!",
