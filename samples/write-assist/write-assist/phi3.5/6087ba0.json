Our souls entwined like ivy upon an ancient stone did weave a bond that even Time should fear not to break:\n\nFair maiden fairer than fields of gold under Sol’s bright eye all-seeing, I beseech thee with heavy heart and chest burdened by sorrow's weight—thy hand no longer shall mine hold. Oft have we danced 'neath love's sweet canopy ere the night grew old; yet here at dawn must part be writ in tears untold:\n\nThou art akin to morning’s bloom that kisses dew-kissed leaves with life as gentle sun doth stir them from slumber deep. Our whispering voices didst sing beneath Luna's tender gaze, yet now her light grows dim when I my own must partake:\n\nFor mortal love oft finds its end within the grasp of fate; thus stand we not by each other’s side in constant embrace or beseech. Such is cruel jest that Cupid himself might well envy—his arrows misplaced, his aim too sweet for us who must henceforre:\n\nTo parting'd shores I cast mine eyes reluctant gaze; as ships depart upon Neptune’s vast dominion bound. Thine image a haunt within my mind and heart shall hold—like phantom wraith where love once found refuge tenderly sweet, adrift in sorrow we must both find our way:\n\nThus let us part with respect intact; though heavy is the crown of grief that hangs upon each brow who loved beyond measure’d time. Soft passions wane as days grow short and cold'en night doth come—but know, dearest love once felt did soar high above all reason or decree:\n\nForsooth! Farewell to thee my heart hath sighed its very last for; yet in memory’s hallowed hall shall echo our tender tale. So beseech I leave with hopeful grace this parting scene—for though apart we might, love's true essence shan't be taken:\n\nAnd so must I unto the morrow yield my final breath anew; each sunset’s dying light a pallor on life before recedes. Yet know that even as night doth fall and dream of thee does fade—our tender love shall live forevermore in hearts we've molded, shaped:\n\nFor though our paths diverge like rivers to different seas; within each sunset’s dying light a memory deep ensnares. Thus let us part with solemn grace that marks the final scene where once didst meet—our souls but fragments of an ancient love story so sweetly penned:"
