  "output": "Upon a day when skies are clear and winds are calm,\nA hero doth return, with valor wrought within his arm.\nHis shield doth glow in sunbeams where they play,\nAnd his sword singeth praises as he doth parade.\n\nHe rideth forth upon a steed that nigh doth shine,\nWith feathers fanned by breezes through the wintry sign.\nThe woodland echoes of his name aloud and clear,\nA tale it be, of valorous deeds unseen before.\n\nUpon his arrival, all in raptures take their place,\nFor he hath brought with him tales whereof to trace.\nOf quests he tells, and battles fought with steadfast might,\nAnd how beneath the stars, his courage doth abide.\n\nThe moon doth brighten as he maketh land afar,\nA hero's tale is told, as oft it had been starred.\nWith each tale spun from events that erst were done,\nHis noble heart doth shine through every word and tune."
