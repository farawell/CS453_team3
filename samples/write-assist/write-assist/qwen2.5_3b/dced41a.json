  "output": "Upon these green fields where once the verdant vines did play,\nDoth now a tempest rage in fury fierce and raw.\nThe trees, they groan with grief as winds of chaos bring forth,\nTheir branches rend from earth by gusts that threaten to unbind them.\n\nMighty rivers too doth feel their power, bending low,\nWith raging torrents down the land descending slow,\nA flood of wrath, a deluge wild and evermore.\nAnd o'er the mountains steep the rocks are cleaved in twain,\nAs nature's ire upon mankind now doth display."
