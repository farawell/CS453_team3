  "output": "O sweet deceit that dost in hearts combine,\nThou art the root of all enmity and disdain.\nFrom noble halls where vows are sworn with flame,\nTo shadowy courts where secrets doth array.\n\nBetrayals mark the pathway to the dark,\nWhere lips as white as snow in treachery mar.\nEach whisper, each false word, a sword that stabs,\nThe soul within its breast does deeply strike. \n\nOh, how the eyes of once confiding friends\nCan change like fickle clouds, their loyalty gone,\nAnd what was held so dear doth now be cursed.\nYet still they linger on with vain commands.\n\nThus, in this world where trust doth soon decay,\nHow wretched is one borne to such despair!\nBut let not hope all that dark despair subdue,\nFor oft the sun doth break through darkest night."
