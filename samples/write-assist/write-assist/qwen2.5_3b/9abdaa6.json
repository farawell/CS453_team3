This abode is fashioned by flames that dance on walls of stone, where cobwebs dare not linger long, nor doth frost dare to entwine their icy threads. \n\nIn this place where air scarce breathes or water runs with fire, a treasure rich beyond compare hath been stowed away. The jewels therein, the gold and silver, are laid in rows most orderly, each piece more precious than any pearl that floats upon the deepest sea.\n\nYet within these walls there lurketh dangers dire, for Draconis, though wise of heart and vast his knowledge, is fierce as tempests and swift as wildfire when angered. His wrath is swift to kindle, and none shall dare provoke him without cause or need; for he hath sworn never to forgive such wrong.\n\nIn the midst of this place of glory and grandeur, a maiden named Lysandra sought solace in these very halls, her troubles vast as mountains within her soul. She pondered much of fate, and how her heart could find safety, should peril threaten her from without or without her knowledge.\n\nThus it was that she deemed the lair safe enough for her to rest upon nights spent wearying through the trials of day's pursuit; but soon she learned what naught else might one like Lysandra ever learn. For ere the moon's ethereal light began to wane, Draconis did stireth from his slumber deep.\n\nWhen at last he heard her sigh and murmur in distress within his domain, then did he lift his gaze from the scrolls of old where secrets many years before had been revealed. Soothly the maiden was not unknown to him; she'd often sought his counsel on matters most perplexing and fraught with fear.\n\nAt first Draconis might have deemed her call to be but another task among many, a duty to undertake without pause or thought. But when he caught sight of her wailing in despair and anguish that she bore, then did he quail before the love that burned within her breast. For though untried had she been with him before, it seemed as if fate had conspired against all reason.\n\nSo forthwith summoned he a table for them both to sit and share their sorrows, his presence warm and comforting like a father's embrace yet fierce as lightning in its might. And thence began a tale that none could tell save by the light of stars at dusk or dawn, one wherein Lysandra shared her thoughts and fears with Draconis, seeking strength through him alone.\n\nIn such discourse did they find solace, as well as hope for times to come, though much it seemed but naught more than shadows upon a wall. Yet all would surely change once again; what was planned within the heart of Draconis could not be thwarted by love or strife or care that might befall him.\n\nThus ends our tale in this most wondrous place where glory meets peril and danger, for evermore will Lysandra know the grace of a dragon's heart."
