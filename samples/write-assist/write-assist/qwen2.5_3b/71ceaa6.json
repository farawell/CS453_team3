  "output": "Upon this season of autumn, when the leaves in golden hues do sway,\nAnd earth itself with russet garb from summer's bright attire doth now array.\nBeneath the vaulted skies where crimson clouds and amber dews do weep,\nMy heart doth yearn with nature's grace, a verdant tapestry so deep.\n\nIn fields of gold where harvests fair and mirthful festivals do call,\nThe spirits stir within me, as I muse upon these autumnal fall.\nWhere shadows lengthen slow like silver spires that pierce the dusky air unkind,\nAnd whispers softly speak to my soul, 'tis here true poetry is found.\n\nOh, oft have I beheld this spectacle, with awe and wonder filled full o' me,\nThe rustling leaves beneath the moonlight's glow do paint a scene of verdant hue.\nWhere specters of the old, in ghostly guise, do dance upon this fleeting hour,\nAnd all around in colors deep as velvet, beauty doth its magic trace.\n\nThus, I entreat thee not to bid me absent from this autumnal feast of grace,\nFor should I be denied these sights and sounds, my heart shall surely ache.\nWhere would the muse find solace if she were not to revel in this wondrous sight?\nMy spirit calls forth thus, 'twas ever so with poet's soul did once delight.\n\nTherefore I beg thee kindly aid me here, dear friend, to grace this autumnal round,\nAnd share these glories with thyself for surely all good causes doth have crown."
