  "output": "Lady fair, whose virtues doth abound,\nIn thee a lily blooms most sweetly crowned.\nThou art the sun, that shinest in the day,\nAnd as the moon dost brighten all thy ways.\n\nYet oft thine eyes, like twin lamps set aglow,\nBy shadows dimmed with secrets dark and slow.\nA chalice full of waters doth not hold\nThe guilt thou bear'st thy virtue to confound.\n\nThou art the star that guides a ship at sea,\nBut some clouds cast o'er thee dark and drear.\nAlas, methinks my words prove but in vain,\nFor what is virtue without a virtuous train?\n\nYet still I marvel how this mystery,\nDoth oft in thee so flawfully display.\nSo let it be: thy virtues are not lost,\nBut hid by veils of sin that time doth toss."
