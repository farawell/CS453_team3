  "output": "In times of tempestuous seas,\nWhen winds do howl and break the calm skies,\nThere came a vessel fraught with men of might,\nWho dared to venture forth in perilous flight.\n\nUpon the deck stood each his noble seat,\nEach arm emboldened for the sea's unrest.\nYet, oh! The night brought darkness and the tempest,\nThat wrenched their ships amidst an ocean vast.\n\nAlas! A sudden surge did breach their hulls,\nAnd soon they drifted with a fate unknown.\nThe ship, once grand and regal in its towers,\nNow lay aground upon the rugged shores.\n\nWithin that ruin, as the morning dawned,\nThe men did mourn the loss of what was dear.\nSome whispered tales of valor and renown,\nWhile others sought to mend their shattered cheer.\n\nThus perished then the ships and all therein,\nAs fates decreed they should not be sustained.\nYet in the memory of those who sailed aboard,\nTheir names remain, though their vessel hath been lost."
