  "output": "In the realm where chivalry doth reign,\nThere dwelt a noble knight, whose valorous name\nWas known throughout the land with reverent awe.\nHe sought a quest that seemed most perilous yet fair,\nA journey fraught with trials and temptations dire,\nWherein he must prove his worth unto the King.\n\nOne day, the monarch sent forth his herald knights,\nAnd bade them seek him who could earn a knighthood's rights.\nAmong these came one young squire in armor bright,\nGowned in the hues of valor and chivalry's delight.\n\nThe noble knight, whose heart was true and fair,\nDrew near to view this youth that dared to compare\nHimself unto the bravest knights and fairest knights al a'earth.\nWith eyes aglow with eager hope, like bright stars forth cast,\nHe spake aloud in tones that oft did warble so,\nAnd thus he bade him say his quest's design.\n\nThou hast bespoken me of feats most grand and brave,\nThe perilous quests wherein the stoutest heart doth crave.\nFor thee a quest I'll undertake, methinks with glee,\nTo prove myself against dark sorrows and dire deathe,\nAnd see if thine valor does indeed surpass all others in might.\n\nThus did this noble knight his choice with eager vow\nTake up the challenge, 'gainst thy perilous vow."
