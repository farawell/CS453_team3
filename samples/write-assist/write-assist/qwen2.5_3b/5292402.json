  "output": "Upon a day of gloom and tumult,\nA king did stand in thine own court.\nHis heart with woe oppressed, his soul distraught,\nFor troubles greater than he had untold.\n\nThe realm lay sick beneath the sun’s bright gaze,\nWherein unrest and chaos did prevail.\nHe pondered if within his reign\nThere could be found a cause of such delay.\n\nYet, doubts arose like shadows in the night,\nHastening fear to darken every sight.  \nFor though he ruled with power, as was fit,\nHis subjects' hearts were in rebellion’s plight.\n\nThus, amidst this strife and bitter strife,\nThe king did seek advice of old.\nHe sought some counsel from his greatest life,\nTo guide him through these troubled times and nigh.\n\nFrom many sages thusly summoned,\nA myriad thoughts abounded.\nSome bade him war to quell the stormy morn,\nYet others counseled peace with gentle hand.  \n\nOft did he entreat a sage for counsel,\nWho said, \"Behold! A choice doth lie within thee,\nTo win or lose, but all depends on thy decision,\nUpon this land's fate and future’s lease.\"\n\nWith heavy heart the king then spoke aloud,\n\"Thou sayest true, my councilor of old; \nA task so dire how shall I best perform?\nWhat path shall guide me from this very brink?\"\n\nIn silent thought did he his wisdom seek,\nAnd saw a way that seemed most perfect.\nHe knew to act with justice and do right,\nTo heal the kingdom's wounds with love’s sweet light. \n\nThus, with noble heart did he decide,\nHis kingdom would be saved by deeds of love,\nFor in those deeds alone could evil cease,\nAnd make his realm once more at peace with ease.\n\nSo forth, he sent his loyal subjects forth,\nWith gifts and favors to their people’s worth.\nThough trials lay ahead both wide and steep,\nHe knew his path was set for them to keep."
