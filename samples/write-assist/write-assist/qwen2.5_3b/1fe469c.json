  "output": "Upon the vast and tempest-tossed sea,\nWhere winds do weave their wild melodious woe,\nA ship's bold helm does guide its course.\nI am a mariner of spirit so true.\n\nIn oceans where the swells do rise and fall,\nMy soul doth sway with every gale and call,\nEach wave that crashes on our canvas bark\nDoth bear within it tales both vast and stark.\n\n'Tis not upon dry land nor soft retreat,\nThat I have trod, but only by the sea,\nWhere winds are stern and skies themselves may turn,\nYet in my breast a steadfast heart doth burn.\n\nThe stars above and moon upon the deep,\nGuide to our journey's course I make no sleep.\nNor morns that dawn with silver linings bright\nCan still my sails from roiling waves of night.\n\nTo thee, whom thou dost summon thusly close,\nI bid fair miss thy gracious invitation.\nFor in this life a sailor shall forever thrive\nUpon the winds and tides where tempests rise."
