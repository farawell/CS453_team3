  "output": "In this night when silver beams do light,\nUpon the earth with gentle grace they flit.\nA moon so bright, as if it doth impart\nA symphony of peace and silent heart.\n\nLet us beneath the vaulted heavens lie,\nWhere shadows softly dance in every sigh.\nFor here the stars do weep their silvery tears,\nAnd silver beams like lute's sweet music bears.\n\nUpon this earth where whispers oft are heard,\nIn silence, we shall find our spirits clear.\nThough hours may pass and daylight doth arise,\nOur bond remains unbroken as it were a prize."
