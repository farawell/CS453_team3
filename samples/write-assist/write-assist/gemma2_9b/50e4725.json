Though thy banquet doth sound most fair,\n\nA thousand thanks for thine invitation, I swear!\n\nAlas, a shadowy specter haunts my humble dwelling tonight,\n\nAnd 'tis with grave solemnity that I must take flight.  \n\n\nLet me not be taken amiss, but haste doth make delay, \nI'll join thee at another hour, when phantoms fade away!\n\n\n\n\n"
