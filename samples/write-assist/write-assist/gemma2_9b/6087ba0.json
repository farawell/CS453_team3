Thy invitation, though most kind and fair, \n\nDoth meet with sorrow, for I cannot bear\n\nTo miss thy table, yet a weighty task\n\nDemands my presence ere the sun doth bask. \n\n\nMy heart doth yearn to join thee in good cheer,\n\nBut duty calls me, casting shadows near.\n\nPerhaps another time, when stars align,\n\nWe'll share a meal, and make this moment fine.  \n"
