Thou dost bid me join thee at thy board, \nA feast for senses, rich and full of cheer.\nBut alas, my friend, I am sorely hindered,\nBy duties bound, I cannot stay this here.\n\nAnother day, perchance a happier hour,\nWhen I may grace thy table with delight.\nUntil then, fare thee well, with blessings dowered,\nAnd revel in the evening's festive light.\n\n\n"
