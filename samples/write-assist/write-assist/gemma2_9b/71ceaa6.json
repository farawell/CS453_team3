  "output": "Hark! A request most fair doth reach mine ears, \nFor a sonnet spun of autumn's golden tears.\n\nUpon the stage where summer once did reign,\nNow crimson leaves in graceful dances stain.\nThe wind, a bard with mournful melodies,\nDoth whisper tales through rustling, ancient trees.\n\nWith amber hues, the sun doth softly fade,\nAs nature slumbers, weary and betrayed. \nYet in this sleep, a beauty doth reside,\nA tapestry of colors, soft-hued and wide.\n\n\n"
