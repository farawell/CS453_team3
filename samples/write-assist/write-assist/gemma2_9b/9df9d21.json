Thou speakest of a feast most grand,\nAnd biddest me to join thy merry band.\nAlas, my heart doth yearn to be with thee,\nBut fate hath spun a different destiny.\n\nAnother call, I cannot shun its might,\nAnd thus must leave this joyous gathering tonight.\nForgive my absence, though it grieves me sore,\nPerhaps another time, we'll meet once more. \n\n\n"
