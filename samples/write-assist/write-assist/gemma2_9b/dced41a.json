Who hath extended this hospitable gesture?  \n\nWith such knowledge, I can craft a verse most fitting, a refusal both polite and pleasing to the ear. \n\n\nLet me weave words like silken threads,\nA tapestry of regret it shall be read.\nSpeak now, and let my quill take flight,\nTo pen a sonnet, dark as night!  \n"
