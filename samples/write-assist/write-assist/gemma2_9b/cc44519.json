I shall endeavor to craft a sonnet most fitting for thy request. \n\nSpeak thou now, and let me know the sentiment thou wishest to convey in this rejection of a dinner invitation. Tell me, is 't with gentle regret, or perchance with veiled excuse?  Doth the speaker yearn for the company yet feel bound by duty, or doth a bolder resistance lie beneath their tongue?\n\nThe more detail thou givest, the finer the verses shall be! \n\n\n"
