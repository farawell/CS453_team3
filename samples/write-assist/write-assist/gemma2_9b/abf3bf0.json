Thy words doth reach mine ears, an invitation most kind, \nTo share a feast with thee, 'neath heavens serene and lined.\n\nAlas, fate weaves a tapestry most cruel this very night,\nFor duties bind me fast, and plunge me in sorrowful plight.\n\nThough thy company I yearn for, with heart both light and true, \nI must alas decline thine offer, and bid thee adieu.\n\n\n"
