Meanwhile, the sky is illuminated by striking bouts of lightning.</p>\n<p>Once more, we witness how rain has a calming effect with its gentle touch. Parallel to this tranquility are powerful cracks in thunder that resound through the atmosphere and brilliant flashes from each occurrence of <em>lightning</em>. These natural phenomena occur simultaneously yet offer unique auditory and visual experiences.</p>"
