  "output": "It seems like you've listed your ideas in the same way. Let me try to help you brainstorm some potential song titles based on your ideas.\n\nHere are a few possibilities:\n\n1. \"Realms of Wonder\"\n2. \"Beyond the Mystic Gate\"\n3. \"Whispers from Elyria\"\n4. \"The Lost City's Song\"\n5. \"Starlight Serenade\" (for a more ethereal, otherworldly feel)\n6. \"Moonlit Quest\"\n7. \"Mythic Tides\"\n8. \"Echoes of Avalon\" (for a touch of magic realism)\n9. \"Fantastical Dreams\"\n10. \"In the Realm of Wonder\"\n\nIf you'd like me to come up with more ideas, I can ask for clarification on your fantasy world and its themes. What kind of creatures or beings inhabit this world? Are there any particular mythologies or folklore that inspire your idea?\n\nAlso, do you have a preferred music genre in mind (e.g., epic fantasy rock, folk-inspired, etc.)?"
