  "output": "Based on your input, I'll generate two possible song title ideas. Since you've provided the same description for both songs, I'll try to make them distinct while still conveying the essence of autumn leaves.\n\n**Song Title Idea 1: \"Autumn's Symphony\"**\nThis title captures the musical quality of the season, suggesting a harmonious blend of colors and sounds. It's catchy and easy to remember, making it perfect for a song that aims to evoke feelings of warmth and coziness.\n\n**Song Title Idea 2: \"Fleeting Embers\"**\nThis title takes a more poetic approach, hinting at the brief but vibrant life of autumn leaves. The word \"ember\" suggests a glowing, fading light, which fits perfectly with the theme of leaves turning colors before falling. This title has a melancholic undertone, inviting listeners to cherish the fleeting beauty of nature.\n\nLet me know if either of these titles resonate with you, or if you'd like me to generate more options!"
