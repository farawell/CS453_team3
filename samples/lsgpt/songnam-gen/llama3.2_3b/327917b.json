  "output": "It seems like you're starting to brainstorm some song ideas! I'd be happy to help generate some potential song titles based on your input. Here are a few ideas:\n\n**Song Idea 1:** \"Lost in the Haze\"\nThis title could work for a song about feeling disoriented or uncertain, perhaps with a theme of self-discovery or navigating through difficult times.\n\n**Song Idea 2:** \"Echoes of Memories\"\nThis title might be fitting for a song that explores nostalgia, reminiscing about past experiences or memories. It could also have a melancholic tone, reflecting on what's been lost over time.\n\nWhich one of these titles resonates with you, or would you like to generate some new ideas?"
