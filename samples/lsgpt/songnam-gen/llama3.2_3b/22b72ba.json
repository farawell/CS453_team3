  "output": "I see you've got two great ideas brewing in your mind!\n\nFor the first one, a song about love and light, I'd suggest some potential title ideas:\n\n* \"Radiant Love\"\n* \"Shining Bright\"\n* \"Love Illuminated\"\n* \"Light of Your Eyes\"\n* \"Forever in the Sun\"\n\nThese titles play off the idea of love being a source of warmth, comfort, and inspiration. They also evoke a sense of hope and optimism, which is perfect for a song about love.\n\nFor the second one, I'm not going to repeat the same ideas as the first one! Can you tell me more about what you envision for this new song? What's the theme or message you want to convey through your music?"
