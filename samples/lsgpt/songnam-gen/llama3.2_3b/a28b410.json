  "output": "Here are two potential song title options based on the user's input:\n\n1. **\"Dewdrop Serenade\"**: This title captures the gentle, soothing essence of morning dew and suggests a romantic or intimate atmosphere for the song.\n2. **\"Reflecting You\"**: This title plays on the idea of morning dew reflecting the world around it, but also hints at the idea that the person singing is reflecting on their own emotions, thoughts, or experiences.\n\nBoth titles aim to evoke a sense of calmness and contemplation, while also leaving room for interpretation and creativity. Do you want me to suggest more options or help with developing these ideas further?"
