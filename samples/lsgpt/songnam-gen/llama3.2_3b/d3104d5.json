  "output": "Based on your input, I've generated two potential song title ideas:\n\n1. **\"Eternal Embers\"**: This title captures the eternal nature of true love and the warmth that can burn bright even after years have passed. It's a simple yet evocative phrase that conveys the timelessness of romance.\n2. **\"Forever in Hindsight\"**: This title has a more bittersweet tone, suggesting that true love is often viewed in hindsight, where memories are cherished and regrets are forgiven. It's a poignant reminder that timeless romance can be both beautiful and heartbreaking.\n\nWould you like me to generate more options or would you like to provide more context for your song ideas?"
