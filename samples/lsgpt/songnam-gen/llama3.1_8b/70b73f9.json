Assuming that, here are two potential song title ideas based on your input:\n\n1. **\"The Road Unraveled\"**: This title suggests a song about exploring the twists and turns of life's journey, with each verse revealing a new insight or experience.\n2. **\"Pathways and Pivots\"**: This title implies a song that navigates through the ups and downs of life, highlighting moments where decisions are made, and paths are chosen.\n\nWhich one resonates with you, or do you have any other ideas in mind?"
