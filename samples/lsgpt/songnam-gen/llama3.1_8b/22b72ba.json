  "output": "Two beautiful themes for songs.\n\nLet's see... for a song about \"love and light,\" I'd like to suggest some title ideas:\n\n1. **\"Beams of You\"** - a play on the idea that the person you love is a source of warmth and light in your life.\n2. **\"Love Shines Through\"** - a title that captures the idea that true love can illuminate even the darkest moments.\n3. **\"Sunny Side Up\"** - a fun, upbeat title that evokes feelings of joy and happiness, perfect for a song about the brighter side of love.\n4. **\"Heart to Heart Light\"** - a title that suggests a deep connection between two people, illuminated by their shared love for each other.\n5. **\"Light Up My World\"** - a title that implies a desire for someone to bring light and joy into your life.\n\nWhich one resonates with you? Do any of these titles spark an idea for your song?"
