  "actualOutput": "CD (Cardinal number) - In this context, \"Every\" is used to indicate each or all instances of clouds. It functions similarly to demonstrating quantity and can be treated as an adjective modifying the noun that follows it. However, since 'every' typically refers countably discrete objects in standard English usage, some grammars might argue for CC (Coordinating conjunction) instead when considering its role closely within a larger syntactic structure where multiple such elements are being connected or compared. Context is key here; without additional information on how \"Every\" functions grammatically with the following word(s), it's safest to default to CD as per standard definitions, but keep in mind this can be context-dependent for more advanced linguistic analysis.",
