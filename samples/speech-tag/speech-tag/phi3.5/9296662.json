  "output": "CD (Cardinal number) in the phrase \"Every\" as it indicates quantity. However, since there is no clear indication of context or further words to assess grammatical function accurately within this isolated snippet, if ambiguity arises due to lack of information surrounding usage and role herein, return CantAnswer.\n\nHere: DT (Determiner) because \"Every\" functions as a determiner specifying each cloud in the general sense being discussed. It denotes totality or completeness without exclusion before nouns such as 'cloud.' \n\n(Note that this answer assumes basic understanding of English determiners' role and might not account for all nuanced grammatical situations.)"
