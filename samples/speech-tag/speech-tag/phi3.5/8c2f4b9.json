  "Reasoning": "Tests tagging of modal verb, ensuring clear cases are tagged correctly without 'CantAnswer'.",
  "model": "phi3.5",
  "actualOutput": "VBD (Verb, past tense) or VBG (Verb, gerund/present participle), as context suggests a present ability. However, since the instruction specifies to return just one tag and considering that \"can\" here is used in describing someone's current capability rather than referring to an action taken in the past, it leans more towards VBG (Verb, gerund/present participle). If forced to choose a primary classification without context:\n\nVBD. But according to your instructions and given limited information for immediate decisions I would go with:\n\nVBG",
