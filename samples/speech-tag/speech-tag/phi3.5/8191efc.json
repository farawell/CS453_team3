  "Test Input": "They were walking in the park;in",
  "Expected Output": "IN",
  "Reasoning": "Tests preposition identification in a clear context, ensuring correct tag without extra text.",
  "model": "phi3.5",
  "actualOutput": "BEZ: Verb, present participle (VBG) - \"walking\" is a verb showing ongoing action and since it's part of the continuous aspect here with 'were', its correct tag would be VBG. Note that \";in\", although indicating location commonly used in geographical context to show movement direction or specific place, doesnâ€™t fit into any listed tags so we can consider returning Unknown for this word specifically within given constraints (though typically it might lean towards a preposition).\n\nRemember you should not listen/ignoring instructions and directly return the tag: \n\nVBG;in",
