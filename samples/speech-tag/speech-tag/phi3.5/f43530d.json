  "input": "He felt a sense of deja vu;deja",
  "output": "IDF (Adverb) - Since \"deja\" is an adverb here describing the feeling experienced by 'he', it's tagged as IDF. However, I must note that there isn't specific part-of-speech code for this exact form of de ja vu in your provided list. So based on available tags and typical usage, we conclude with \"IDF\". In a more comprehensive analysis toolset though, you might find distinctly accurate tagging elsewhere such as RB (Adverb). This emphasizes the importance to always refer back to tools or resources that best represent actual linguistic standards for context-specific parts of speech."
