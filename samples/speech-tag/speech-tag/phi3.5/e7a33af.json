  "Expected Output": "NN",
  "Reasoning": "Verifies that 'school' is tagged precisely as a noun, ensuring no incorrect tags are assigned.",
  "model": "phi3.5",
  "actualOutput": "NNS (Proper noun, plural) or NN (Proper noun, singular), depending on the context. Without additional context indicating whether \"school\" refers to a specific institution's name or education in general, both could be possible. However, as there is no clear indication of being part of a list item marker, possessive ending, symbol, wh-determiner/pronoun, we can eliminate those options. Between NNS and NN, if it refers to the specific place (\"Her school\"), then it's likely an apposition (which doesn't have a tag in this context), but given that there are no additional modifiers or determiners present:\n\nNN (Proper noun, singular) would be appropriate here. Since \"school\" is used as the name of something specific and not plural nor possessive in nature within your sentence without more details (\"Her school\"), we assume it's a unique entity which typically align with NN for proper names:\n\nNN (Proper noun, singular) - assuming 'school' refers to an institutional or named place.",
