  "input": "The cat sat on the mat;mat",
  "output": " Part #1: Identify the sentence and word contained in that sentence.\nUsage: \"The cat sat on the mat\"; \"mat\" is identified correctly from the given user statement. This meets the criteria because it extracts both the sentence and the target word within the context of the sentence. \n\nPart #2: Determine the part of speech for a given word and return just the tag for the word's part of speech.\nUsage: \"mat\" is identified as a noun in this example, thus its corresponding part-of-speech tag (NN) is returned. This satisfies the requirement by correctly identifying the part of speech for the target word. \n\nPart #3: Return only the part of speech tag if possible; return Unknown if not.\nUsage: The task specifies a predefined list of parts of speech tags and it should follow this structure to provide an answer, so in our example, we are provided with \"NN\" which is for nouns and matches correctly with mat's categorization as a noun within the context of the given sentence. \n\nPart #4: If you cannot tag the word (e.g., due to ambiguity or if it doesnâ€™t fit into any category), return CantAnswer.\nUsage: In our example, since we have a clear identification and classification for \"mat\" as noun in this context, we don't need to implement the CantAnswer clause here because there is no ambiguity around its categorization. \n\nFinal Answer: NN"
