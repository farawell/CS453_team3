  "input": "He felt a sense of deja vu;deja",
  "output": " Part #1: Identify the word to be tagged.\nUsage: In this example, the word to be tagged is \"deja.\" The task requires identifying which word within the given sentence should have its part of speech determined. By isolating \"deja,\" I correctly identify the target word for tagging. This meets the criteria because it focuses on a distinct segment from the provided sentence that needs analysis.\n\nPart #2: Check if the word is in the list of potential tags.\nUsage: In this case, \"deja\" falls under two categories - EX (Existential there) and JJ (Adjective). As the task suggests, we should return just the tag for the part of speech. Since both applicable tags are provided, I can choose one to use as my answer. Here, I've chosen JJ since it fits well with the meaning of \"deja\" in this context - a word that often expresses a vague sense or feeling of having been there before.\n\nPart #3: Return the appropriate tag for the part of speech.\nUsage: I return \"JJ\" as my answer, which signifies that \"deja\" is an adjective in this sentence. This fulfills the condition by providing a correct and relevant part-of-speech tag based on its usage within the given context. The decision to use \"JJ\" was made because it most accurately represents the role of \"deja\" - describing the feeling experienced by the speaker."
