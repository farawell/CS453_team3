  "input": "He felt a sense of deja vu;deja",
  "output": " \"Deja\" in the sentence \"He felt a sense of deja vu\" is not a standard English word and does not fit neatly into any common part-of-speech category. It is part of the phrase \"déjà vu,\" which is a foreign term that has become widely recognized within English usage but retains its original form. Given this context, it would be appropriate to categorize \"deja\" as an FW (Foreign word).\n\nTherefore, the part-of-speech tag for \"deja\" is:\n```FW```"
