If ""sudden"" is the intended focus, then JJ (Adjective). If ""change"" is the focus, then IN. 

For the given input, if it's interpreted as ""sudden change"" then the appropriate tags could be:

- JJ (Adjective) for ""sudden""
- IN (Preposition or subordinating conjunction) for ""change""

So, the tags would be: JJ, IN.

If it's intended as ""2 change"", the tags would be:

- CD (Cardinal number)
- IN (Preposition or subordinating conjunction)

So, the tags would be: CD, IN.

If neither interpretation is correct, then the answer would be:

CantAnswer. 

Please provide more context for a precise tagging.",failure
