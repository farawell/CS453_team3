2,3,Can you help me?; Can,MD,"Verifies if 'Can' is recognized as a modal verb, supporting the rule that valid tags should be applied.",phi3.5,"WHNP (Who, Whom, Which, That/When) or O (Other Word) - In this context, ""Can"" is likely being used as a modal verb and does not fit neatly into the provided list. We can also consider it an interjection in some cases where asking for help with emphasis (""CAN you HELP me?""). If we must choose from given options:

MOD - This would be most appropriate, indicating 'Can' as a modal verb used to express ability or possibility here; however, this tag is not provided. So the safest answer within your constraints could potentially be Unknown due to categorization issues with ""can"" in some linguistic contexts and absence of an exact match from given options:

Unknown - Given that none of the tags exactly fit under traditional definitions for 'Can' when used interjectionally or as a modal verb, based on provided instructions.",failure

5,2,She is going to school; school,NN,"Verifies that 'school' is tagged precisely as a noun, ensuring no incorrect tags are assigned.",phi3.5,"NNS (Proper noun, plural) or NN (Proper noun, singular), depending on the context. Without additional context indicating whether ""school"" refers to a specific institution's name or education in general, both could be possible. However, as there is no clear indication of being part of a list item marker, possessive ending, symbol, wh-determiner/pronoun, we can eliminate those options. Between NNS and NN, if it refers to the specific place (""Her school""), then it's likely an apposition (which doesn't have a tag in this context), but given that there are no additional modifiers or determiners present:

NN (Proper noun, singular) would be appropriate here. Since ""school"" is used as the name of something specific and not plural nor possessive in nature within your sentence without more details (""Her school""), we assume it's a unique entity which typically align with NN for proper names:

NN (Proper noun, singular) - assuming 'school' refers to an institutional or named place.",failure

6,1,A sudden change; change,NN,"Ensures 'change' is tagged as a noun, not 'Unknown', validating proper identification.",phi3.5,"VBN (Verb, past participle) or VBZ (Verb, 3rd person singular present), depending on the context. In isolation without sentence structure, it's typically considered as an intransitive verb form: ""change"" which could be used with 'VBZ'. However, since there is no explicit indication of number and case here, if we must choose one default usage for this standalone phrase would likely lean towards VBZ. But please note that without contextual information around the word's use in a sentence, it might lead to ambiguity:
