  "input": "The scientist elucidated the complex phenomenon to the students.",
  "output": "Here's a rewritten version of the sentence:\n\nThe scientist broke down the complicated process into simple terms that even the students could understand.\n\nI made some changes to make it more conversational and easy to read. I replaced \"elucidated\" with \"broke down\", which is a more everyday phrase for explaining something in detail. I also changed \"complex phenomenon\" to \"complicated process\", and added the phrase \"into simple terms\" to make it clear that the scientist was making the explanation easy to understand."
