  "output": "**Overall Feedback:**\nYour essay provides a clear overview of climate change, its causes, and effects. However, there are several areas where you can improve your arguments' structure and enhance your language use for a more engaging read.\n\n**Spelling Edits:**\n\n* \"climatechagne\" → \"climate change\"\n  * Reason: Spelling error.\n* \" Effects\" → \"effects\"\n  * Reason: Missing space after the period.\n* \"occouring\" → \"occurring\"\n  * Reason: Spelling error.\n\n**Grammar Edits:**\n\n* \"Global warming is happenning due to human activities.\" → \"Global warming is happening due to human activities.\"\n  * Reason: Add a hyphen to make \"happening\" a compound adjective.\n* \"One of the main effect of climate change is rising sea levels.\" → \"One of the main effects of climate change is rising sea levels.\"\n  * Reason: Change \"effect\" to \"effects\" for plural agreement with \"levels\".\n* \"If nothing is done about it, then...\" → \"If nothing is done about this, then...\"\n  * Reason: Add \"this\" after \"it\" for better flow.\n\n**Structural Suggestions:**\n\n* Consider using transitional phrases between paragraphs to improve the flow of your arguments.\n* For instance, you could start a paragraph with \"Moreover,\" \"In addition,\" or \"Furthermore\" to connect related ideas and create a stronger argument.\n\n**Opportunities for Improvement:**\n\n* Use more active voice. For example, instead of saying \"It is believed that...\" say \"Scientists believe that...\".\n* Vary sentence structure to make your writing more engaging. Currently, many sentences start with the subject followed by a verb. Mix it up by starting with the object or using other sentence structures.\n\n**Formatting Guidance:**\n\n* Ensure consistency in heading sizes and styles throughout your essay.\n* Consider using bullet points or numbered lists for easier readability when discussing multiple causes or effects of climate change.\n\nWould you like me to rewrite your essay incorporating these changes?"
