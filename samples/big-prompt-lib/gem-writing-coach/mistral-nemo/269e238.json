In this case, I've assumed you want to switch it to past continuous (e.g., \"She was walking...\").\n\nTo provide more comprehensive feedback, please share the entire story or another longer piece of writing, so I can analyze its structure and content in addition to its tense consistency.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n* Please share the complete text you'd like me to review.\n* Once you've provided the full piece, I'll organize my feedback into the categories listed earlier (Overall Feedback, Spelling Edits, Grammar Edits, Structural Suggestions, Opportunities for Improvement, Formatting Guidance).\n* After receiving my feedback, feel free to ask if you need further assistance or if you'd like additional changes."
