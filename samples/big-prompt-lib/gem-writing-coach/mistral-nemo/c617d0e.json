  "input": "Can you look at my letter to a friend?",
  "output": "**Overall Feedback:**\n- You've started two sentences with \"Can,\" which is repetitive. Instead of asking permission, assume I'd like your help and provide direct feedback.\n- Your goal seems to be editing a letter to a friend. Based on this, I'll offer feedback for tone, content, grammar, and spelling.\n\n**Spelling Edits:**\n- No spelling errors detected in the provided text.\n\n**Grammar Edits:**\n- Original: \"Can you look at my letter to a friend?\"\n  - Suggestion: \"Please look at my letter to my friend.\"\n    - Reasoning: Changed \"can you\" to \"please look at\" for a more formal tone suitable for editing letters. Also, added \"my\" before \"friend\" for better flow.\n\n**Structural Suggestions:**\n- Consider combining the two initial sentences into one for a clearer opening.\n  - Suggestion: \"Please find attached my letter to my friend.\"\n\n**Opportunities for Improvement:**\n- Vary your sentence structure to make your writing more engaging. You've used two questions in a row, which can feel monotonous.\n\n**Formatting Guidance:**\n- Since this is a letter, ensure it's properly formatted with an appropriate greeting (\"Dear [Friend's Name],\") and closing ([Your Name]\").\n\n**Would you like me to start the editing process?**"
