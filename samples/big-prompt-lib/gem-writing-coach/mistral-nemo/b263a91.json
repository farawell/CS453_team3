  "output": "**Overall Feedback:**\nYour letter is well-structured and easy to follow. However, there are a few areas where we can improve spelling, grammar, and clarity of expression. I'll provide line-by-line edits and suggestions for improvement.\n\n**Spelling Edits:**\n\n- Line 3: \"recieiving\" should be spelled as \"receiving\"\n  - Reason: The correct spelling includes two 'e's after the 'c'.\n\n- Line 5: \"accomodate\" should be spelled as \"accommodate\"\n  - Reason: The correct spelling has three 'm's.\n\n**Grammar Edits:**\n\n- Line 2: \"I have been trying to get a hold of you for over a month.\" should be restructured as \"I have been trying to reach you for over a month.\"\n  - Reason: \"Get a hold of\" is informal. Using \"reach\" makes the sentence more formal and precise.\n\n- Line 6: \"We have not recieved any payment yet from our last invoice...\" should be changed to \"We have not received any payment yet regarding our last invoice...\"\n  - Reason: \"Recieved\" is misspelled, and adding \"regarding\" improves clarity.\n\n**Structural Suggestions:**\n\nConsider combining the opening sentences for a smoother introduction:\n- Original: \"Dear [Name], I am writing to discuss our outstanding balance.\"\n- Revised: \"Dear [Name], I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to discuss our outstanding balance, which has remained unpaid for over a month.\"\n\n**Opportunities for Improvement:**\n\n- Consider using the present perfect tense (\"have sent\") instead of the simple past (\"sent\") in line 4 for consistency with the other verbs used.\n- In line 7, consider specifying the date or invoice number to make your request more concrete.\n\n**Formatting Guidance:**\n\nFor a formal letter like this one, use:\n- A concise and polite greeting (e.g., \"Dear [Name],\")\n- Single-spaced paragraphs\n- Bold text for section headers (if applicable)\n- Traditional closing (e.g., \"Sincerely,\") followed by your full name\n\n**Do you need anything else?** Would you like assistance with rewriting any sections or incorporating these changes?"
