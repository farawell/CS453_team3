  "output": "I can see you're starting your essay, but unfortunately, your sentences are a bit unclear and lack detail. Here's broken down what needs improvement:\n\n*   Remove duplication - You've repeated the main topic of your essay in the opening sentence, which makes it feel redundant.\n*   Add context - Provide some background information on climate change to give readers an idea of why this topic is important.\n\nHere is a rewritten version of your prompt:\n\n\"The effects of human activity on our planet's temperature are becoming increasingly apparent. Please edit my essay on climate change.\"\n\nThis revised sentence still conveys the main point but in a more concise and effective manner.\n\nNow, let's look at the sentence structure and word choice to create clearer sentences and improve clarity.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n\"The effects of human activity on our planet's temperature have been becoming increasingly apparent. Please edit my essay on climate change.\"\n\n*   Use active voice - Instead of \"are becoming,\" use \"have become.\"\n*   Choose clear words - For words like \"becoming,\" choose a more descriptive word to avoid ambiguity.\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance with your writing."
