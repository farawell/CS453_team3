  "output": "I'll provide an overview of my approach before giving you the categorized feedback.\n\n**Overall Feedback**\n\nYour text seems to be stating a clear objective, which is to receive feedback on two essays. However, it appears that there's a repetition in your sentence structure, as you've mentioned having \"an essay that needs feedback about grammar and tense consistency\" twice without adding any new information. To rephrase this for better clarity, consider starting with a single sentence that clearly states the purpose of the text.\n\n**Spelling Edits**\n\n* The word \"needs\" is correctly spelled.\n* No spelling errors were found in this passage.\n\n**Grammar Edits**\n\n* In your first sentence, you've used a comma after \"essay.\" While it's not an error per se, it's worth noting that some style guides (e.g., Chicago Manual of Style) recommend using semicolons instead of commas to separate items in a list. However, in this case, the comma is correct.\n* In your second sentence, the repetition makes it seem like you're stating the same information twice without adding anything new. Consider rephrasing this sentence or removing the repetition altogether for better clarity.\n\n\n**Structural Suggestions**\n\nConsider combining the two sentences into one to improve flow and reduce repetition.\n\nExample: \"I have an essay that needs feedback on grammar and tense consistency, specifically from identifying areas where I can improve.\"\n\nDo you want me to proceed with generating edited text incorporating these suggestions or would you like me to elaborate further?"
