  "output": "Here is your rewritten text with suggested edits and explanations:\n\nOriginal text:\n\"My essay has spelling errors. Can you highlight them?\"\n\nSuggested edit:\n\"I've noticed that my essay contains spelling errors. Could you please point them out for me?\"\n\nChanges made:\n\n* Changed \"My essay has\" to \"I've noticed that my essay contains\" to make the sentence more formal and concise.\n* Removed the repetition of the phrase \"spelling errors\" and instead used a more active verb (\"contains\") to describe the issue.\n* Changed \"Can you highlight them?\" to \"Could you please point them out for me?\" to make the request more polite and specific.\n\nOverall Feedback:\nThe original text is clear and concise, but it's quite repetitive. By rephrasing it, we can make it sound more polished and professional. Additionally, using a more active verb helps to convey the message in a more engaging way.\n\nSpelling Edits:\n\n* None needed! This text was error-free to begin with.\n\nGrammar Edits:\n\n* None needed!\n\nStructural Suggestions:\nConsider breaking up long sentences into shorter ones for easier reading. For example, instead of \"I've noticed that my essay contains spelling errors,\" you could say \"I've identified some spelling mistakes in my essay.\"\n\nOpportunities for Improvement:\nNone noted, but as mentioned earlier, breaking up long sentences can improve the readability of your text.\n\nFormatting Guidance:\nNot applicable in this case, as there are no formatting issues to address."
