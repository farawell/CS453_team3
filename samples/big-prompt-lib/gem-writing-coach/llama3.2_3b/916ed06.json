  "output": "Here's some line-by-line feedback on your rewritten sentence:\n\n* \"What do you think about\" is a good opening phrase, but it's repeated in the second part of the sentence. Consider combining the two sentences into one for better flow.\n\n**Revised suggestion:** \n\"What do you think about the structure of my essay?\"\n\nThis revised sentence still conveys your question, but with improved grammar and reduced repetition.\n\n* The sentence as a whole could be considered too repetitive or circular (i.e., \"What do you think about...?\"), so feel free to expand upon what specifically draws your attention to the structure."
