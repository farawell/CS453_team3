  "output": "Here's my feedback:\n\n**Overall Feedback**\nYour request is clear, but there's a minor issue with word repetition. You've mentioned \"essay\" twice, which isn't necessary. I'll provide you with the edited text, but first, let me give you some suggestions.\n\n**Spelling Edits**\n\n* None\n\n**Grammar Edits**\n\n* The sentence \"I have a essay that needs feedback about grammar and tense consistency.\" is missing an article (\"a\") before \"essay\". It should be \"I have an essay...\". Consider using the word \"an\" instead of \"a\" to make it more polished. Here's the corrected sentence:\n\"I have an essay that needs feedback about grammar and tense consistency.\"\n\n**Structural Suggestions**\n\n* The second instance of \"essay\" is unnecessary, as I mentioned earlier.\n\n**Opportunities for Improvement**\n\n* Consider adding a brief description or explanation of what type of essay you're working on (e.g., argumentative, analytical, persuasive). This will help me provide more targeted feedback.\n* If you'd like to provide the actual essay text, I'd be happy to give you line-by-line edits and suggestions for improvement.\n\nWould you like to share the actual essay text or get further assistance?"
