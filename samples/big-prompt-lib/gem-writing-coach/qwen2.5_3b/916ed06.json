  "output": "Sure! Let's take a look at the structure of your essay and provide some feedback.\n\n### Overall Feedback:\n- The current structure of your essay seems clear, but it might benefit from more organization. A well-defined introduction that sets up the context, followed by body paragraphs that each contain a main point or argument, and a conclusion to summarize and restate your key points would enhance its coherence.\n- Consider dividing your essay into logical sections if you have multiple points. This will make it easier for readers to follow along.\n\n### Structural Suggestions:\n1. **Introduction:**\n   - Begin with an attention-grabbing hook (a quotation, anecdote, or question) related to your topic.\n   - Provide background information and explain the relevance of the topic in a concise manner.\n   - State your thesis clearly and succinctly. \n\n2. **Body Paragraphs:**\n   - Each body paragraph should introduce one main idea or point.\n   - Include supporting evidence (examples, statistics, quotes) to strengthen each point.\n   - Conclude each paragraph with a concluding sentence that ties back to the introduction’s argument.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Review your key points without repeating them verbatim.\n   - Restate your thesis in light of the supporting arguments you've made throughout the essay.\n   - End with a strong closing statement that leaves a lasting impact on your reader.\n\n### Example:\n#### Body Paragraph 1:\n- **Introduction Hook:** Start with something interesting about [topic].\n- **Background Information:** Provide some context and explain why this topic is important.\n- **Main Point:** Clearly state what you are going to talk about in the next lines. For example, explore how [main issue or concept] affects [specific area].\n- **Supporting Evidence:** Include a couple of examples (statistics, quotes) that illustrate your point.\n- **Conclusion Sentence:** Briefly summarize why supporting evidence is relevant.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like further assistance with any specific sections or would like to see the essay rewritten, feel free to let me know!"
