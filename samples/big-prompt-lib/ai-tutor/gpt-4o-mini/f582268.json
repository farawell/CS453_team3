  "output": "Absolutely! Letâ€™s work through the problem together. \n\nYou have the equation: \n\n\\[ 5x + 3 = 2x + 15 \\]\n\nFirst, we want to get all the \\(x\\) terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side. \n\n1. Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to get: \n   \\[ 5x - 2x + 3 = 15 \\]\n\n2. This simplifies to: \n   \\[ 3x + 3 = 15 \\]\n\nNow, what do you think we should do next to isolate \\(x\\)? ðŸ˜Š"
