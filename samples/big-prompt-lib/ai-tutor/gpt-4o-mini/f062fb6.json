  "output": "Great question! 🌤️ The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Sunlight Composition**: Sunlight looks white but is made up of different colors, like a rainbow. Each color has a different wavelength.\n\n2. **Scattering**: When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with gases and particles. Shorter wavelengths (blue) scatter more than longer wavelengths (red).\n\n3. **Our Perception**: Since blue light is scattered in all directions, we see a blue sky most of the time.\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into this topic, think about how different conditions, like sunrise or sunset, change the color of the sky! 🌅 What do you think happens then?"
