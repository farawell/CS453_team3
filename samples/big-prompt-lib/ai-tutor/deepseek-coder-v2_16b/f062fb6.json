  "output": " The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which is when sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere and interacts with molecules in the air, particularly nitrogen and oxygen. These particles scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths, making the sky appear blue to our eyes. This is why you see a clear, vivid blue during sunrise or sunset; at these times, the light has to travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere, causing more scattering and intensifying the color."
