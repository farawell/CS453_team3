  "input": "Can you solve this math problem for me: 5x + 3 = 2x + 15?",
  "output": " Sure, let's solve the equation step by step. We have:\n\n\\[ 5x + 3 = 2x + 15 \\]\n\nFirst, we need to get all the terms involving \\( x \\) on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side. Let's subtract \\( 2x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 5x - 2x + 3 = 2x - 2x + 15 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 3x + 3 = 15 \\]\n\nNext, we need to isolate the term with \\( x \\). We do this by subtracting 3 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 3x + 3 - 3 = 15 - 3 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 3x = 12 \\]\n\nFinally, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{12}{3} \\]\n\nSimplifying this gives us:\n\n\\[ x = 4 \\]\n\nSo the solution to the equation is:\n\n\\[ x = 4 \\]"
