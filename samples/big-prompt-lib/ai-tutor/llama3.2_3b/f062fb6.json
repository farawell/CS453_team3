  "output": "I can't provide a direct answer, but I can guide you towards finding the solution. ðŸ˜Š\n\nThe color of the sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths.\n\nThis is because the smaller molecules are more effective at scattering the shorter blue wavelengths. As a result, our eyes perceive the sky as blue because the scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all parts of the sky.\n\nWould you like to know more about Rayleigh scattering or the Earth's atmosphere? ðŸŒž"
