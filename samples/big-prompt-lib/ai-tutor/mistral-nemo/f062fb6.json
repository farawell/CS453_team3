  "output": "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This occurs when sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere and gets scattered by molecules and tiny particles in the air. Blue light has a shorter wavelength compared to other colors like red or yellow, so it's scattered more widely, making the sky appear blue. Isn't physics fascinating? ðŸŒŽâž—ðŸ”µ Now, let's see if you can explain this concept using your own words!"
