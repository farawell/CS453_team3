  "output": "Plants grow through a process called photosynthesis. In simple terms, it's like this: they take in sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, and then produce oxygen and energy to make their food. This happens mainly in their leaves, which is why they need sunlight to grow! Isn't that cool? Now, can you tell me what other factors affect plant growth? ðŸŒ±"
