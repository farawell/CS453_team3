  "output": "Photosynthesis is like a plant's superpower! 💪 Here's how it works:\n\n1. Plants take in **carbon dioxide** (CO₂) through tiny openings on their leaves called stomata.\n2. They also absorb water (H₂O) from the soil through their roots, which then travels up to the leaves.\n3. Using sunlight energy, plants convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (sugar), which they use for food. This process happens in theirchloroplasts – little factories inside their cells.\n4. While making glucose, plants also produce oxygen (O₂) as a byproduct. This is why plants are sometimes called \"factories of life\"!\n5. Lastly, the glucose produced during photosynthesis is used by plants to make energy for growth and reproduction.\n\nSo, in simple terms, photosynthesis is like plants' way of eating sunlight! 🌞🍃"
