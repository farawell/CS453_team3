  "input": "Can you solve this math problem for me: 5x + 3 = 2x + 15?",
  "output": "To solve this equation, let's isolate the variable x by getting all the terms with x on one side and the constants on the other.\n\nFirst, subtract 2x from both sides to get:\n\n5x - 2x + 3 = 2x - 2x + 15\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3x + 3 = 15\n\nNext, subtract 3 from both sides to get:\n\n3x = 12\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:\n\nx = 12 / 3\nx = 4\n\nSo, the value of x is 4."
