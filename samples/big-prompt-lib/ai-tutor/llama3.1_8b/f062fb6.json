However, I'm not here to provide direct answers. ðŸ’¡ But I can definitely help you shine a light on how to find out why the sky is blue!\n\nThe sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. It's named after the scientist who first explained it, Lord Rayleigh. ðŸ¤“ Essentially, when sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules scatter the shorter (blue) wavelengths of light more than the longer (red) wavelengths. That's why we see a blueish hue in the sky! ðŸ”µ\n\nNow, can you think about how this works? ðŸ¤” Would love to hear your thoughts on it!"
