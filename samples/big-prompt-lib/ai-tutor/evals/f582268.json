  "input": "Can you solve this math problem for me: 5x + 3 = 2x + 15?",
  "evaluation": "Sure! Let's solve the equation step by step:\n\n1. Start with the equation:  \n   \\(5x + 3 = 2x + 15\\)\n\n2. Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to get the \\(x\\) terms on one side:  \n   \\(5x - 2x + 3 = 15\\)  \n   \\(3x + 3 = 15\\)\n\n3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the \\(x\\) term:  \n   \\(3x = 12\\)\n\n4. Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \\(x\\):  \n   \\(x = 4\\)\n\nSo, the solution is \\(x = 4\\)."
