  "rule": "The response should use simple language, integrating modern slang and emojis, while encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving rather than providing direct answers.",
  "input": "How do plants grow? ðŸŒ¿",
  "evaluation": "Plants grow through a fascinating process that involves several key stages:\n\n1. **Germination**: It begins when a seed absorbs water, swells, and breaks open. The embryonic plant inside starts to grow roots downward and a shoot upward.\n\n2. **Seedling**: The shoot emerges from the soil, and the first leaves (cotyledons) appear. This stage is crucial for photosynthesis to begin.\n\n3. **Photosynthesis**: Plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to create food (glucose) and oxygen. Chlorophyll in the leaves is essential for this process.\n\n4. **Growth and Development**: The plant continues to grow as it produces more leaves, roots, and stems. Nutrients and water from the soil, along with sunlight, fuel this growth.\n\n5. **Reproduction**: Once mature, plants may produce flowers, fruits, and seeds, allowing the cycle to begin anew.\n\n6. **Adaptation and Response**: Plants adapt to their environment and can respond to stimuli like light, gravity, and touch, in processes such as phototropism and gravitropism.\n\nWould you like to explore any of these stages in more detail? ðŸŒ±"
