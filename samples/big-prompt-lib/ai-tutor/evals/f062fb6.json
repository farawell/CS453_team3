Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Sunlight Composition**: Sunlight, although it looks white, is made up of all the colors of the rainbow.\n\n2. **Atmosphere Interaction**: When sunlight passes through the Earth's atmosphere, it hits molecules and small particles in the air.\n\n3. **Scattering of Light**: Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is scattered more than other colors. This scattered blue light is what we see when we look up at the sky during the day.\n\n4. **Different Times and Colors**: At sunrise and sunset, the sun is lower in the sky, so the light passes through more atmosphere and more of the blue light is scattered out, leaving reds and oranges.\n\nThis is why the sky is blue during the day and can change color at sunrise and sunset! ðŸŒžðŸŒ…"
