  "output": "Sure, I can help with that! Let's solve the equation step by step.\n\nGiven:\n\\[ 5x + 3 = 2x + 15 \\]\n\nFirst, we want to get all the \\( x \\) terms on one side and the constant numbers on the other side. We'll subtract \\( 2x \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 5x - 2x + 3 = 2x - 2x + 15 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 3x + 3 = 15 \\]\n\nNext, we'll isolate the term with \\( x \\) by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 3x + 3 - 3 = 15 - 3 \\]\n\nSimplifying this gives us:\n\\[ 3x = 12 \\]\n\nFinally, to solve for \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3x}{3} = \\frac{12}{3} \\]\n\nSo,\n\\[ x = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation \\( 5x + 3 = 2x + 15 \\) is:\n\\[ x = 4 \\]"
