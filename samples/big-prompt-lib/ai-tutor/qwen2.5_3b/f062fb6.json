  "output": "That's a great question! The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Let me explain it to you in a simple way.\n\nWhen sunlight enters Earthâ€™s atmosphere, it hits molecules and tiny particles like water droplets or dust in the air. Light travels in straight lines, but when it encounters these small things in the air, it gets bent slightly due to its interaction with those tiny particles. \n\nBlue light has shorter wavelengths than other colors of visible light. Because blue light waves are shorter, they scatter more easily and more widely as they pass through the air compared to other colors like red or orange.\n\nAs a result, when you look up at the sky on most days, you see mostly scattered blue light, which gives it its characteristic blue color during the day. This is why the sky often appears blue!"
