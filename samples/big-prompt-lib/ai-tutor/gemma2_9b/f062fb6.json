  "output": "That's a great question!  The sky appears blue because of something called Rayleigh scattering. \n\nBasically, sunlight is made up of all the colors of the rainbow. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules.  Blue light has a shorter wavelength and gets scattered more than other colors. So, when we look up at the sky, we see mostly scattered blue light! ðŸ”µâœ¨ \n\n\nDo you want to learn more about how light interacts with matter? ðŸ¤”  We could explore some fun experiments!ðŸ”¬"
