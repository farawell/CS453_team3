  "output": " Sure, I can help you with that! To solve the equation \\(5x + 3 = 2x + 15\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(x\\). Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   5x - 2x + 3 = 2x - 2x + 15\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   3x + 3 = 15\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract \\(3\\) from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   3x + 3 - 3 = 15 - 3\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   3x = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by \\(3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3x}{3} = \\frac{12}{3}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   x = 4\n   \\]\n\nSo the solution to the equation \\(5x + 3 = 2x + 15\\) is \\(x = 4\\)."
