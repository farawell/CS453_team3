  "output": " Photosynthesis is a fascinating process where plants convert light energy into chemical energy! Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Light absorption**: It all starts with sunlight. Special pigments in plant cells, like chlorophyll, absorb light energy and pass it on to other molecules. 🌞\n2. **Water splitting**: Using the absorbed energy, water (H₂O) molecules are split into oxygen (O₂), released into the air, and hydrogen (H⁺). 💦\n3. **Calvin Cycle**: The hydrogen from step 2 combines with carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air to create glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆), a type of sugar that plants use for energy and growth. 🍃\n\nAnd there you have it! This process not only provides food for plants but also releases oxygen, which is essential for life on Earth. Pretty cool, huh? 🌍"
