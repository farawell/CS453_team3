  "output": " That's a great question! The sky appears blue due to a process called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it is scattered in all directions by the tiny molecules and particles in the air. Blue light has a shorter wavelength than other colors, so it gets scattered more. This is why we perceive the sky as blue. ðŸŒžðŸ’™"
