  "validityText": "The input provided is a joke. It consists of two sentences: \"I threw a boomerang a few years ago. I now live in constant fear.\" The joke plays on the idea that boomerangs return to the thrower, humorously suggesting an exaggerated and ongoing anticipation of its return after many years. This structure fits into the category of a joke. There are no restrictions on the content or length of the joke according to the specification, as humor is subjective. The input is coherent and clearly categorizable as a joke.\n\nOK",
