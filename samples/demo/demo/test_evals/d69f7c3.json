  "validityText": "The input is a joke: \"What do you call a fish with no eyes? Fsh.\" This consists of a setup question followed by a punchline, which matches the structure commonly seen in jokes. Humor is subjective, and there are no content restrictions in the input specification. The joke is coherent enough to be categorized, as it follows a recognizable format and communicates an attempt at humor through language play. As such, it complies with all the points outlined in the input specification that describe what constitutes a valid input.\n\nOK",
