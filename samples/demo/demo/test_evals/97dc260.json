  "validityText": "The input \"Parallel lines have so much in common. It’s a shame they’ll never meet.\" is a textual statement and follows the format of a joke. It plays on the concept of parallel lines in geometry, which never intersect, to create a humorous situation by personifying the lines as entities with commonalities that will never 'meet'. This aligns with the input specification which states that the input must be a joke, can be in text format, and can include any type of content, such as a pun. There are no restrictions on joke length, and the input fits within the definition of a pun, making it a valid joke as per the specification.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
