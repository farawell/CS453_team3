  "validityText": "This input is a joke. It consists of two sentences, with a setup \"Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself?\" and a punchline \"It was two tired.\" The wordplay on \"two tired\" (sounding like \"too tired\") is a typical construction in humor, which aligns with the input specification that humor can be expressed using any language constructs and there are no restrictions on content. The joke is coherent and categorically fits as a joke, satisfying the specification requirements.\n\nOK",
