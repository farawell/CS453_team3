  "input": "What do you call fake spaghetti? An im-pasta.",
  "coverage": "funny",
  "validity": "The input consists of a text string that is structured as a joke. The question \"What do you call fake spaghetti?\" sets up the premise, and \"An im-pasta.\" serves as the punchline, which involves a play on words (\"im-pasta\" sounding like \"imposter\"). According to the input specification, the input is indeed a joke and is provided as a text string. There are no restrictions on length or language, and thus, the input meets all the given criteria.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
