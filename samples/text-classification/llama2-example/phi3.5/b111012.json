  "input": "World leaders discuss climate action at summit",
  "output": "The provided text should be classified under the \"World\" category. The classification is based on the content of the sentence which talks about world leaders engaging in a discussion concerning global environmental issues, particularly related to climate change during an international meeting or summit. This directly aligns with current events and topics that are typically covered within World news coverage.\n\nHere's how this can be done:\n\n1. Read the input text carefully - \"World leaders discuss climate action at summit\"\n2. Identify key elements in it â€“ 'world leaders', discussion, and a global issue (climate change), all of which indicates that these are international topics usually covered by World news category outlets or resources such as Reuters, BBC News etc.. \n3. Match the context with predefined categories - Here our options include: \"World\", \"Sports\",\"Business\" and \"Sci/Tech\". When compared to other possibilities like sports events (involving competitive matches), business affairs which revolve around commercial or corporate developments, sci-tech news typically focuses on technological advancements. The input text clearly does not fall under these categories as it concerns global climate issues discussed by leaders at a summit - an international political event that is generally featured in worldwide current events coverage..\n4. Based upon this analysis the article should be classified into \"World\" category, thus providing context-specific relevance and comprehension to where news stories are typically reported or focused on within global media platforms; furthermore indicating a sense of public interest and understanding about these environmental concerns that require urgent international attention as world leaders convene.\n\nThe final classification is: World"
