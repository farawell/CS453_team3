  "Test Input": "Tech giant unveils ambitious plan: What does it mean for consumers?",
  "Expected Output": "Business - Focus on consumer impact",
  "Reasoning": "Tests if additional commentary is incorrectly included.",
  "model": "phi3.5",
  "actualOutput": "Given the context of the provided information and its content focusing on a significant technological initiative that directly impacts consumer experience, this news article can be classified under \"Sci/Tech\". This category usually covers developments in technology companies' plans or changes. However, given tech giant here could also slightly relate to business aspects as it discusses the implications for consumers — a bridge between Sci/Tech and Business categories might occur often with such news articles due to their dual nature affecting both technological development (Sci/Tech) and consumer market dynamics (Business). In this case, without additional context specifying economic or corporate strategy aspects explicitly stated in the text snippet provided, I would lean slightly more towards \"Sci/Tech\" given its core topic.\n\nHere is how you could structure an example output:\n\nCategory: Sci/Tech\nReasoning: The article's subject matter centers around a technological development—a plan being unveiled by what I assume to be a significant industry player, often tech companies referred in the examples. It further delves into aspects of this advancement and its consequences for end-users or consumers engaging with technology daily which typically falls under Sci/Tech journalism because it involves technological innovation reporting.\n \nPlease note: If there was more context about whether a business strategy, consumer implications in economic terms, financial impacts, etc., were discussed at length within the news article excerpt provided—this could affect classification toward 'Business'. However, with limited information available from your request here, Sci/Tech is selected for its primary focus on technology development.",
