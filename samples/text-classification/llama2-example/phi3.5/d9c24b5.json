  "actualOutput": "Business: \"Economics and Ethics: Balancing Profit and Social Responsibility\" This classification is based on the primary focus of balancing economic aspects (profit) with moral considerations, which typically falls under business news as they often discuss corporate strategies, impacts, ethical dilemmas in trade-offs between profitability for organizations versus their societal responsibilities. However, since this piece also delves into an aspect of social consideration and responsibility (ethics), it slightly overlaps with Sci/Tech due to these interdisciplinary discussions occasionally taking place within science or technology sectors too when they deal with issues like data privacy, artificial intelligence ethics etc., but the core topic remains in economic activities. Hence, Business is most appropriate for this classification.",
