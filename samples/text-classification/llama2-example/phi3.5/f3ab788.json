  "output": "Given the context and content provided in your input text about artificial intelligence (AI) affecting contemporary military strategies or tactics, I would classify this news article under \"Sci/Tech\". This category is selected because it mostly relates to advancements, researches, issues related to technology such as AI which falls specifically within the realm of science and technology.\n\nHere's how we can break down your text for a clearer understanding: \n1. \"The impact\" indicates an analysis or evaluation taking place; it frequently appears in academic articles where new technologies are being studied, hence this points to something educational (sci/tech).\n2. AI is the central subject of discussion here - which directly relates to technology and advancements within that area ('Sci/Tech'). \n3. Modern warfare typically implies a current state or trend in science-related fields, particularly where it integrates advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence for strategies (sci/tech).  \n4. \"A dual perspective\" suggests differing viewpoints on the matter; this approach is often used within research articles to provide comprehensive analysis which aligns with 'Sci/Tech' reports or studies discussions about emergent technologies and their implications, like AI in warfare scenarios here.\n\nRemember that classification can sometimes be subjective depending upon specific instructions for the topic at hand but based on standard normative practices of categorization under these guidelines Iâ€™ve deduced this particular input as 'Sci/Tech'."
