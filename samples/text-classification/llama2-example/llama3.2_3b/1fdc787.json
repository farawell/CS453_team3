  "output": "I would classify the given text as a Business category. Although the topic is \"veganism\" and there may be some cultural or lifestyle aspects to it, the word \"trend\" suggests a broader societal or economic influence, which is more typical of business news or analysis.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that this classification could also fit into other categories like Sci/Tech or Lifestyle, depending on the specific focus of the article. But based on the provided examples and the general tone of the text, I would lean towards Business as the most appropriate category."
