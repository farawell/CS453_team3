  "input": "evidence: A detailed analysis of the climate data from the past 50 years is included. question: Is there evidence of climate change in the last century?",
  "output": "No.\n\nThe question asks about the last century, but the text only mentions the past 50 years. While 50 years could be considered a part of the last century, it's not specifically stated that climate data from the entire last century was analyzed. Therefore, there is not sufficient evidence in this text to confirm that there is evidence of climate change in the last century.\n\nIn addition, even if we assume that \"past 50 years\" refers to the last half of the last century, this still does not cover the whole period asked for in the question. Thus, the answer remains No."
