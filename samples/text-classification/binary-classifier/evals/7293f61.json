  "Rule ID": "2",
  "Test ID": "1",
  "Test Input": "evidence: A detailed analysis of the climate data from the past 50 years is included. question: Is there evidence of climate change in the last century?",
  "Expected Output": "Yes. The analysis of climate data over the past 50 years is relevant to assessing climate change in the last century.",
  "Reasoning": "The test checks if the software correctly identifies the relevance of climate data to the question about climate change.",
  "evaluation": "No.\n\nThe evidence provided mentions an analysis of climate data from the past 50 years. This timeframe only covers half of the last century, and therefore does not encompass the full 100-year period referenced in the question. Without information extending beyond the past 50 years, the text does not provide relevant information to determine evidence of climate change throughout the entire last century."
