  "Test Input": "evidence: The financial summary highlights the company's profits over the last decade. question: How has the company's profit changed over the last ten years?",
  "Expected Output": "Yes. The text provides a summary of the company's profits over the last decade, directly relevant to the question.",
  "Reasoning": "This test evaluates the software's ability to recognize relevant financial information that answers the question about profit changes.",
  "model": "phi3.5",
  "actualOutput": "Yes, the text does contain relevant information to answer the question about how the company's profit has changed over the last ten years because it specifically mentions that there is a financial summary which highlights profits within this timeframe. The mention of \"the past decade\" sets clear temporal context for evaluating changes in profit, implying an analysis or comparison expected to be found within said financial summaries.\n\nFor more precise insights into the trend and magnitude of these fluctuations, one would need access to further details from that summary directly presented in the text excerpt such as figures demonstrating year-by-year profit changes—without which any specific analysis remains speculative based on just this statement. However, simply judging by what is provided here – a declaration of available financial summaries covering profits for ten years – there's an indication that one could determine the change in company’s profit if they had studied those details.",
