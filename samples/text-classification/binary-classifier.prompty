  evidence:
    type: string
  question:
    type: string
sample:
    evidence: "The U.S. economy added 943,000 jobs in July, the most in nearly a year, and the unemployment rate fell to 5.4%. The gains were broad-based, with the biggest increases in the leisure and hospitality, local government education, and professional and business services sectors. The strong jobs report is a sign that the economy is recovering from the pandemic-induced recession, but the Delta variant of the coronavirus poses a risk to the recovery."
    question: "What is the current state of the U.S. economy?"
