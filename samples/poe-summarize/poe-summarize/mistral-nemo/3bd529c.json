Il met en évidence des avantages économiques et environnementaux.\n\n### English Summary\nThe article discusses the impact of renewable energies on global markets, highlighting economic and environmental benefits.\n\n## Summary\n\nRenewable energies have significant positive impacts on global markets from both an economic and environmental perspective.\n\n## Deep Dive Analysis\n\n### Market Disruption & Shift\n- Rapid adoption of renewable energies is disrupting traditional energy markets by reducing demand for fossil fuels.\n- This shift is leading to closure of coal plants in countries like the USA, China, and India.\n- Solar and wind powers are increasingly becoming competitive with conventional sources due to falling costs.\n\n### Economic Benefits\n- Renewable energy jobs are outpacing those in fossil fuel industries. In 2021, global renewable energy employment reached around 12 million jobs.\n- Investments in renewables stimulate economic growth by creating new revenue streams and attracting businesses to regions with clean energy resources.\n- Countries can save billions on energy imports by switching to renewable sources.\n\n### Environmental Impact\n- Renewable energies significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, helping combat climate change and improving air quality.\n- They lower water usage and pollution compared to fossil fuels, benefiting local ecosystems.\n- According to the IEA, accelerated renewables deployment could limit warming to 1.5°C if complemented by energy efficiency efforts.\n\n### Implications for Policy & Industry\n- Governments worldwide increasingly recognize the economic and environmental benefits of renewable energies, driving policies such as feed-in tariffs, net-metering, and carbon pricing.\n- The global energy industry is evolving, with companies investing in clean technologies to future-proof their business models.\n- Countries that lead in renewables innovation and adoption may gain competitive advantages in exports, manufacturing jobs, and attracting investments."
