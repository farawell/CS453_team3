  "actualOutput": "Company names: Apple Inc.\nPeople names: -Tim Cook-\nSpecific topics: product release\nGeneral themes: Innovation and leadership in technology sector\n\nHere's how I extracted each element from your text following the instructions provided:\n\n1. Company Names: The only company mentioned is \"Apple Inc.\" Therefore, it stands alone as a single entity within this context without additional entities to pair with for extraction purposes. \n\n2. People names: Tim Cook has been specifically identified here by mention of his role 'CEO', which distinctly connects him directly with the activities or events in question (new product release). Consequently, I isolated \"Tim Cook\" as a person name relevant to this text snippet.\n\n3. Specific topics: The announcement regarding a new product puts forth an identifiable subject matter for extraction; thus 'product release' is extracted under specific topics since it refers directly to the content-related event that occurred today within our document of interest, here represented by Apple Inc.'s action. \n\n4. General themes: Drawing from multiple cues in this narrative provides a broad understanding beyond discrete words; hence 'Innovation and leadership' emerges as general overarching themes because they encomp each aspect mentioned—today’s announcement of new products by Apple, led under the guidance (and reputation) of their CEO Tim Cook.\n   \nPlease note that topics like innovation are often broad but in this context linked to product releases which indicates a corporate pursuit for advancement and market positioning – an aspect fundamental enough within business discourse as general themes; similarly, leadership is implied from the presence of key figureheads such as CEOs. \n\nIn summary: The structured text extraction focused on pinpointed elements specific to your task—identifying named entities relevant across company mentions and individual roles while distinguishing between discrete events (specific topics) that occurred within this slice of narrative, ultimately framing these findings under broader thematic strokes indicative of industry behaviors or attitudes. \n",
