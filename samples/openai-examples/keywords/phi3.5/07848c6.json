  "Rule ID": "1",
  "Test ID": "3",
  "Test Input": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with carbon dioxide and water.",
  "Expected Output": "Keywords 3: Photosynthesis, green plants, sunlight, carbon dioxide, water",
  "Reasoning": "This test highlights the extraction of significant scientific concepts, ensuring adherence to the rule by focusing on nouns and noun phrases.",
  "model": "phi3.5",
  "actualOutput": "Keywords related to the given text about photosynthesis are: Photosynthesis, green plants, organisms, sunlight, synthesize foods, carbon dioxide, and water. These keywords represent the core elements of the process being described in the original text. Here's a breakdown for clarity:\n\n1. Photosynthesis - The central concept or topic (noun) from which other relevant terms stem.\n2. Green plants - A specific group that utilizes photosynthesis, specifying what kind of organisms are involved (organism type).\n3. Some others - Implies additional types beyond green plants but not specified here; indicates broader scope within the subject matter \n4. Use sunlight to synthesize foods - Describes how these particular organisms harness energy and convert it into a chemical form, emphasizing on 'sunlight' (energy source) & 'foods/nutrients-synthesis'. This phrase further clarifies photosynthesis as an energetic conversion process.\n5. Carbon dioxide - Indicates the raw materials taken in by plants for synthesis during this energy conversion, pointing towards a biological aspect of photosynthesis (chemical substrate). \n6. Water - Another essential input or ingredient required for the chemical reactions involved in producing food through Photosynthesis, thus linking to bio-physicochemistry part of process explanation here(substance used & reactant/product relationship)\n\nThese keywords should effectively summarize and capture key information from your provided text about photosynthesis.",
