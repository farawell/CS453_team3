  "output": "## Empathizing with the User\nAs a budget-conscious student attending college, I can imagine that my primary concerns when considering a laptop would be affordability and value for money. I want to ensure that I can manage my finances effectively while still having access to reliable computing resources.\n\n## Imagining a Situation\nI'm sitting in my dorm room, surrounded by textbooks and notes from previous classes, and I need to compare different laptops on my phone to find one that fits within my limited budget of $500. I've heard good things about this laptop model, but I want to make sure it meets all my needs before making a purchase.\n\n## Generating Questions\nBased on the user's situation and concerns, here are two questions they might have about the laptop:\n\n```\n{\"question\": \"Can I use this laptop for online classes and general college work within a budget of $500?\"}\n{\"question\": \"Are there any deals or discounts available on this laptop from the college bookstore or online retailers that could help me stay within my budget?\"}\n```"
