A tale of valor bold, \nA knight's adventure to be told!\nSir Gareth, strong and true of heart,\nSet forth on journeys set apart.\n\n**(Chorus)**\nOver hill and dale he rode,\nBy dragon's breath his courage glowed,\nThrough forests dark and shadows deep,\nHis loyalty, a promise to keep.\n\nA maiden fair, in peril caught,\nFrom wicked sorcerer she fought.\nSir Gareth heard her mournful plea,\nAnd swore to rescue her, you see.\n\n**(Chorus)**\nOver hill and dale he rode,\nBy dragon's breath his courage glowed,\nThrough forests dark and shadows deep,\nHis loyalty, a promise to keep.\n\n\nHe faced the fiend in twisted hall,\nWith blade of silver, answered call.\nThe sorcerer fell with mighty roar,\nAnd Gareth set the maiden free for evermore!\n\n**(Chorus)**\nOver hill and dale he rode,\nBy dragon's breath his courage glowed,\nThrough forests dark and shadows deep,\nHis loyalty, a promise to keep.\n\n\n\n\nThough trials came and dangers sought,\nSir Gareth rose, with valor wrought. \nA noble knight, forever known, \nIn legends sung, on every throne!\n\n\n"
