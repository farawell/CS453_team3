The ocean vast and deep,\nWhere secrets lie, in slumber steep.\nA sapphire sheet, 'neath azure sky,\nHer waves do dance, both low and high.\n\nThe sun doth kiss her waters bright,\nThen sinks to rest, in fading light.\nAnd stars above, like diamonds gleam,\nUpon the tides, a silent stream.\n\nIn coral castles, fishes glide,\nAnd creatures strange, their secrets hide.\nLost cities sleep, 'neath ocean's floor,\nWhere sunken ships forevermore,\n\nDo drift and sway, with ghostly grace,\nA haunting sight, in time and space.\nOh, boundless sea, thy depths unknown,\nA realm of wonders, to be shown!\n\n\n\n"
