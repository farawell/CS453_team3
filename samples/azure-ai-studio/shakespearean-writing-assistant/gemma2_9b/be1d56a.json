  "output": "Hark! A tale of sorrow I shall spin, of Eldoria, a kingdom once so grand, where emerald fields did meet the sapphire sea, \n\nAnd castles rose like giants to the sky. King Alaric, wise and just, ruled o'er his folk, with fairness in his heart and strength in stride. But shadows crept upon Eldoria's golden hour, whispers of a dragon, scales as black as night, whose fiery breath could turn forests to ash.\n\nAlaric, brave and true, donned armor bright, with loyal knights beside him, formed a host, to face this menace, shield his kingdom dear. They marched into the heart of mountains cold, where smoke did curl from caverns deep below. \n\nThere they found the beast, its eyes like burning coals, roaring defiance as Alaric drew near. A clash of steel upon cruel scales ensued, heroes fell, their courage laid to waste.  Yet Alaric fought with all his might and main, forcing the dragon back, a wound it bore.\n\nBut victory's sweetness turned to bitter pain, for in its final throes, the beast unleashed a blast, a torrent fiery that consumed the mountain's crest. The earth did tremble, rocks gave way to fire, and Eldoria fell, swallowed by the pyre.\n\nKing Alaric, valiant, laid low, his kingdom lost, his warriors gone, leaving behind only silence, ash, and mourning. So ends this tale of glory turned to dust, a warning whispered on the wind's lament: that even mighty kingdoms may be crushed by fate, and heroes fall before an envious hate.  \n\n\n"
