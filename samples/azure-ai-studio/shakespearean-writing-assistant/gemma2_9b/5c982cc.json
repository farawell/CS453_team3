  "output": "Hark! Beneath yon silver orb so bright,\nTwo souls entwine in dance of pure delight.\nWith nimble steps and laughter light as air,\nThey twirl and leap, a joyous pair.\n\nHe doth lead with gallant grace and ease,\nWhile she responds with smiles that brightly please.\nTheir garments flow like silken moonlit streams,\nAs they chase shadows 'mongst the whispering dreams.\n\nEach touch a spark, each glance a whispered fire,\nIgniting passions that burn ever higher.\nThe crickets chirp a serenade so sweet,\nA symphony for dancing, light on feet. \n\n\n\nThis dance, a poem spun in moonbeam's glow,\nWhere love and laughter gently ebb and flow.  \n"
