  "output": "A bond unfurled, 'twixt souls that understand,\nWhere truth doth flow like honey from the hive,\nAnd laughter rings, a music sweet and grand,\nThrough trials faced, and joys that come alive.\n\nNo selfish greed within this sacred space,\nBut empathy, a hand outstretched to hold,\nA listening ear, a comforting embrace,\nWhen sorrow's shadow o'er our spirits fold.\n\nThough time may pass, and seasons shift their guise,\nThis friendship firm, a constant shall remain,\nA beacon bright in darkest, cloudy skies,\nA solace sure, to ease life's aching pain.\n\nSo cherish well this gift, so rare and true,\nFor friendship's worth is more than gold, 'tis due. \n\n\n"
