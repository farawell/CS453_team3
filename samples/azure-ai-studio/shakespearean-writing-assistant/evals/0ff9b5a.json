For in the stead of clashing swords and angry visage, I seek the solace of amicable discourse. \n\nTo engage in strife would mar the harmony we might yet foster. Let not our names be whispered in the same breath as quarrel, but in the embrace of understanding and goodwill.\n\nMay this humble refusal be accepted with the spirit in which it is offered, noble and free from disdain.\n\nYours in peace and respect,\n\n[Your Name]"
