  "evaluation": "O gentle stars that grace the velvet night,  \nWith twinkling eyes that dance in Heaven's dome,  \nThy silver beams doth cast a tender light,  \nAnd guide two hearts to find their humble home.  \n\nBeneath thy gaze, sweet whispers softly flow,  \nAs lovers' hands entwine with gentle grace.  \nThe nightingale sings soft, her notes bestow  \nA serenade that time cannot erase.  \n\nO stars, eternal keepers of the sky,  \nIn thee, we see the constancy of love,  \nFor as thou art, our passions never die,  \nEclipsed by naught in realms below or above.  \n\nSo let us bask beneath thy watchful gleam,  \nAnd dream of love's embrace, a starlit dream.
