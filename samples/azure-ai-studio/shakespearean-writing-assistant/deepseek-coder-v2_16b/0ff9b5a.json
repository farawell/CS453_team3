Personal matters have arisen which cannot be resolved within such a brief time frame, and thus, I am unable to attend.\nPlease accept my apology for any inconvenience this may cause. As a gentleman of honor, I would hate for there to be bad blood between us. Let's leave the matter as an exchange of words on paper rather than actual bloodshed. \nWith all due respect and friendship,  \nYours truly,"
