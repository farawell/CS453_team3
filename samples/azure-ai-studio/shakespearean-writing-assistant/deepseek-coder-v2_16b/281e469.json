  "output": " Upon the vast and boundless sea,\nThere lies its mystery deep to thee.\nThe waves that crash against the shore,\nAre but whispers of the world more furrowed.\n\nThe depths where no man has ever set foot,\nHold secrets untold by any lipped tongue.\nThe creatures that dwell there in the night,\nHave eyes like stars and scales so bright.\n\nThe currents that flow with relentless might,\nCan take you far from all your loved sights.\nBut it's these same waters where ships do ride,\nAnd sailors find their life within its tide.\n\nSo let us marvel at this sea's grand design,\nAnd be awed by the tales it doth divine.\nFor in its mysteries there are more left to learn,\nAnd we who wander on its watery field, must heed for our own safety's sakes."
