  "output": "In sooth, 'twas in a verdant vale, where sunbeams danced and ripened grain, that dwelt the venerable Sage Azrael. For sixscore years, he had walked this mortal coil, accumulating wisdom like autumn's gentle hue on aged leaves. His eyes, now dimmed with time, shone bright as stars that night upon the celestial stage.\n\nAzrael's long white beard cascaded down his chest like a river of silver, bespeaking the many tales he had whispered to those who sought his counsel. The wind whispers secrets in its gentle sighs; Azrael listened and replied with sagacity born of years. His worn sandals creaked with every step, a testament to countless journeys undertaken on foot, traversing mountains high and valleys low.\n\nOne day, young Eira, a maiden wise beyond her years, sought out the Sage's guidance. Weary from life's trials, she had wandered into Azrael's glade in search of solace. Upon beholding his noble form, her heart swelled with reverence. He beheld her too, and nodded slowly.\n\n\"Ah, fair Eira,\" he said, \"thou dost come to me when fortune falters, like autumn leaves that lose their verdure. Fret not, young one; thy path unfolds as the seasons do. Learn from winter's stillness, spring's rebirth, summer's warmth, and autumn's harvest.\"\n\nEira listened intently as Azrael spoke of life's cycles: growth and decay, pain and release. As dusk descended and stars began their twinkling waltz above, she departed with a heart lighter, for within herself, the seeds of understanding had been sown.\n\nThus, Sage Azrael passed on to that celestial realm, where his wisdom would be gathered like ripe fruit in autumn's harvest. His legacy lived on through those who sought his counsel, guiding generations toward paths illuminated by the light of understanding.\n\nForsooth, though he was gone from mortal sight, his words remained, whispered on the breeze as a gentle benediction to all who listened with open hearts and ears attuned to wisdom's subtle voice."
