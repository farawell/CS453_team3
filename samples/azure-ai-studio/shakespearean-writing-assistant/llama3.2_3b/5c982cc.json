  "output": "O, fairest night, when lunar beams doth play\nUpon the earth, in silvery array.\n'Tis then that merriment and joy take hold,\nAnd in this dance, my heart is made of gold.\n\nWith steps so light, as if I floated on air,\nI twirl and spin, without a single care.\nThe moon above, a glowing orb doth shine,\nAs I, with laughter and with music's rhyme.\n\nMy feet, they barely touch the ground below,\nAs in this waltz, of mirth and joy, I flow.\nWith every step, my cares and woes depart,\nAnd in their place, happiness doth fill my heart.\n\nThe world, it seems, is full of magic that night,\nAnd in this dance, beneath the moon's pale light,\nI find my spirit free, and soul takes flight.\nFor in this moonlit waltz, I am made whole and bright."
