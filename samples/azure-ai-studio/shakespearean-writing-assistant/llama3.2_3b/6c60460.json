  "output": "In twilight's hush, where ancient trees do stand,\nA mystic wood, with whispered secrets grand,\nDid beckon mortal feet to wander free,\nInto realms unseen, where magic dwelt with glee.\n\n'Twas called the Shadowglade, a domain of might,\nWhere faeries danced beneath moon's silver light,\nAnd whispers wove a tapestry of wonder wide,\nThat drew the curious and brave inside.\n\nA winding path, where wildflowers bloomed in hue,\nDid lead the traveler on an enchanted route anew;\nThe trees, with gnarled branches, twisted high and low,\nDid seem to whisper secrets, as the wind did blow.\n\nAs twilight deepened, shadows grew long and cold,\nAnd starlight flickered like a fire that unfold;\nIn this ethereal realm, where mystic magic held sway,\nMortal hearts did beat in time with nature's own way.\n\nOne eve, a wanderer chanced upon a clearing bright,\nWhere faeries gathered 'neath the moon's pale light;\nTheir wings, like feathers of the dawn's first blush, did shine,\nAs they sang hymns to life, and love divine.\n\nThe wanderer joined their chorus, lost in sweet delight,\nAs words and laughter mingled with the forest's mystic night;\nAnd as the song did fade, a gift was offered true,\nA token from the faeries, born of magic anew.\n\nThe gift, a flower, whose petals bloomed like sun's own fire,\nDid symbolize the promise made 'neath love's desire;\nFor in this mystic wood, where hearts were free to roam,\nLies hidden magic, waiting for those who dare to home.\n\nThus, as the wanderer departed Shadowglade's hush,\nA piece of wonder stayed within their heart's gentle rush;\nAnd when they looked upon that flower, aglow with secret fire,\nThey knew the magic of the mystic wood would never tire."
