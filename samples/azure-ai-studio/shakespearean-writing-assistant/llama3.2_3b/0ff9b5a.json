Forsooth, I value our mutual acquaintance and esteem above all else, and would not see us engage in combat that may only serve to mar our noble reputation.\n\nMethinks 'twould be more becoming for us to resolve any differences through parley and discourse, rather than the shedding of blood on hallowed ground. Pray, let us turn aside from this notion and seek a peaceful resolution to whatever grievance may have caused thy ire.\n\nMayhap we might meet in a neutral forum, where our words may be heard and understood without the sword's dark shadow looming o'er our heads? In that manner, we might find a way to end this dispute honourably and with our consciences clear.\n\nWith sincerest regrets for any inconvenience my refusal may cause thee, I remain,\n\n[Your Name]"
