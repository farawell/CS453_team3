Verily, thou hast shown great honour in asking, yet I must decline with all due respect.\n\nIn lieu of steel and sinew, I choose instead the path of peace and discourse. Let us eschew violence and seek resolution through words and wisdom.\n\nI hope this decision finds favour in thine eyes, and that our paths may cross again under more amiable circumstances.\n\nWith humble deference,\nThy servant"
