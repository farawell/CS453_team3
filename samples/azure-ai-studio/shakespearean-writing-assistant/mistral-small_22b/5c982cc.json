  "output": " Upon the velvet night, when soft the moon doth shine,\nA playful dance begins 'neath silver beam so fine.\nThe creatures of the wood, in whispers gently called,\nTo frolic and to twirl with steps both grand and small.\n\nIn emerald gowns, the fairies prance with glee,\nWhile nymphs in ruffles white beside them flee.\nTheir laughter rings like bells beneath the sky so blue,\nAs each one vies for space to show what they can do.\n\nA squirrel, quick and bold, leaps up upon a stump,\nAnd joins the merriment with acrobatic bump.\nOh, how the rabbits hop, and deer do gracefully sway,\nIn rhythm to the breeze that sings through branches' ballet.\n\nThe moonbeams cast their glow on this enchanting sight,\nAs creatures great and small dance in pure delight.\nTo watch them frolic thus is like a dream come true,\nA playful dance beneath the moon so bright and new."
