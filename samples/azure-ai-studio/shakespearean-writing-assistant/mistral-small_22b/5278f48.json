  "output": " Upon yon heavens canopy so vast,\nThe twinkling gems of night do take their post,\nEach a spark of divine light amassed,\nYet none hath my heart's devotion boast.\n\nThou art more bright than all the stars above,\nA beacon fair that doth outshine them all;\nFor in thy presence, naught remains unloved,\nEach star pales ere thy radiant smile does fall.\n\nIf I could grasp a star and make it mine,\nI'd still prefer thee by my side to keep;\nFor in thy love, no darkness can confine,\nAnd with thine eyes, no need for stars to sleep.\n\nOh, love so sweet, that makes the heavens seem,\nA mere backdrop to thy celestial dream."
