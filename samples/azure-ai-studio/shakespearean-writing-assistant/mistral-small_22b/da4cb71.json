  "output": " In verdant fields where knights do joust,\nA valiant steed his trusty mount,\nWith sword and shield, his course is set,\nHis heart aflame with no regret.\n\nThrough forests dense and paths untrod,\nHe ventures forth, to seek the sod\nWhere peril lurks and danger lies,\nHis valor burns as he does rise.\n\n\"Fear not,\" quoth he, \"for I shall fight,\nTo vanquish darkness in the night.\nMy strength shall stand, my heart remain,\nUnyielding till the battle's slain.\"\n\nUpon his breast, a shield of gold,\nA symbol bright, stories untold,\nOf tales of yore and deeds so bold,\nIn every crevice, courage cold.\n\nHis journey long, his quest divine,\nTo free the land from evil's sign,\nThrough storm and strife, he doth prevail,\nWith every blow, his legend grows frail.\n\nYet in his grasp, a secret lies,\nA whispered truth that doth surprise:\n\"In every heart, both brave and bold,\nThere lies a tale yet to be told.\"\n\nSo sing, O bards, of this great knight,\nWhose valor shone through darkest night.\nHis deeds shall echo through the ages,\nOf chivalry and love's sweet sages."
