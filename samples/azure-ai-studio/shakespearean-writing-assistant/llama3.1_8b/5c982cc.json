  "output": "Amidst the silvery glow of yonder moon's pale face,\nA merry dance didst unfold in secret place.\nWith steps as light as whispers on the night,\nWe twirled and leapt, our joy taking flight.\n\nOur feet, a-tap with merriment, didst play\nA lively tune upon the dewy grass below that day.\nThe moon, a silver crescent in the sky's dark frame,\nDidst look down on us, her gentle smile aflame.\n\nWith arms entwined, we moved in perfect time,\nAs if the stars themselves hadst written out this rhyme.\nOur laughter echoed through the night's quiet hush,\nA joyous symphony that didst make the heart rush.\n\nThus, beneath the moon's enchanting light,\nWe danced, a carefree pair, on that enchanted night."
