Though thou hast proposed a trial by combat, wherein our honor and prowess shall be weighed, I do humbly decline thy challenge.\n\nMy heart doth not incline towards the shedding of blood, nor do I desire to engage in any contest that mayhap bring harm or ill fortune upon myself or those dear unto me. Furthermore, I deem it more prudent to seek resolution through peaceful means and calm discourse, where wisdom and reason may guide us towards a just and noble conclusion.\n\nI pray thee, good sir, accept my sincerest apologies for not accepting thy duel, and let us instead strive to maintain the bonds of friendship and respect that have long existed 'twixt our households.\n\nThine in amity,\n\n[Your Name]"
