The brave knight's on his way\nThrough mountains steep, and valleys grey\nHe'll face each challenge, with a heart full of might\nAnd in the end, he'll emerge, a shining light\n\n(Verse 2)\nHe traversed forests dark, where beasts didst roam\nAnd crossed great rivers wide, to reach his distant home\nWith every step, his spirit grew more bold\nAnd though the path was fraught with danger, young and old\n\n(Chorus)\nHear ye, hear ye! The brave knight's on his way\nThrough mountains steep, and valleys grey\nHe'll face each challenge, with a heart full of might\nAnd in the end, he'll emerge, a shining light\n\n(Bridge)\nAs sunset fell, upon his weary eyes\nHe spied a maiden fair, with beauty that surprised\nHer smile didst illuminate, the darkening day\nAnd thus, the brave knight's journey took a wondrous way\n\n(Verse 3)\nWith honor in his heart, and virtue as his guide\nThe knight rode on, through night and stormy tide\nFor love and justice called him forth to stand\nA shining beacon, in an uncertain land\n\n(Chorus)\nHear ye, hear ye! The brave knight's on his way\nThrough mountains steep, and valleys grey\nHe'll face each challenge, with a heart full of might\nAnd in the end, he'll emerge, a shining light"
