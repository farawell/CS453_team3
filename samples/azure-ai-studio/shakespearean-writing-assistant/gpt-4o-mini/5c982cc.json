  "output": "In yonder glade, where moonlight glimmers bright,  \nA merry throng doth gather 'neath the night.  \nWith laughter sweet as nightingale's soft song,  \nThey twirl and leap, as though the night were long.  \n\nTheir silken gowns and breeches twine and sway,  \nEach step a whisper, each twirl a ballet.  \nThe silver orb, a watchful eye above,  \nDoth cast a glow, enchanting like sweet love.  \n\nAs gentle breezes kiss their cheeks so fair,  \nThey spin and glide, with naught a single care.  \nIn joyous revelry, their hearts entwined,  \nIn moonlit harmony, their souls aligned.  \n\nThus, under stars, their playful spirits dance,  \nA splendid waltz, a fleeting, sweet romance.  \nLet time stand still, let night in beauty bloom,  \nFor in this moment, they forget all gloom.
