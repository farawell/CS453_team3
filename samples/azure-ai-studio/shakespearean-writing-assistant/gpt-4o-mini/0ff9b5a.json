However, it is with a heavy heart that I must decline thy honorable invitation to duel. \n\nThe path of enmity yields naught but sorrow, and I seek not to mar our fates with such strife. Let us, instead, strive for peace, and find resolution in discourse rather than in conflict.\n\nWith the utmost respect,\n[Your Name]"
