  "output": "In the tale of hope, a gentle spirit doth shine,  \nThrough darkest nights and tempestâ€™s cruel design.  \nThe moral, dear friend, is this truth we find:  \nHope, like a beacon, doth guide the blind.  \n\nWhen trials beset and shadows loom near,  \nLet not thy heart quake, nor yield to fear.  \nFor even in depths where despair seems rife,  \nHope be the flame that kindles new life.  \n\nThus, hold fast to dreams, in thy heart take flight,  \nFor hope is the dawn that conquers the night.  \nIn every sorrow, a seed it shall sow,  \nTo blossom in joy, as the winds of fate blow."
