  "output": "(To the tune of \"Greensleeves\")\n\n1. In days of yore, when valour was in vogue,\n  There lived a knight, of noble hue;\n  His heart did yearn for deeds of renown,\n  And honour's path he'd fain pursue.\n\n2. \"Farewell,\" quoth he to fair maid and kin,\n  \"I'll seek the dragon, fierce and fell;\n  In battle brave, his wrath shall cease,\n  Or ne'er return my story to tell.\"\n\n3.Upon a steed of fiery red,\n  He rode forthwith to face the foe;\n  His lance was strong, his armour bright,\n  And courage burned within his breast below.\n\n4.In castle grim, where shadows held reign,\n  The dragon lay in slumber deep;\n  But ere he woke, our doughty knight\n  Did challenge him with dauntless steed to keep.\n\n5. With fiery breath, the beast did roar,\n  And flames flew forth like deadly rain;\n  Yet ne'er did waver knights so bold,\n  Who faced his fury without stain.\n\n6. Two hearts aflame, they clashed and fought,\n  Each vying for the upper hand;\n  Until at last, with lance well-thrown,\n  The hero pierced the monster's band.\n\n7. Defeated, prone, the dragon lay,\n  Its dying breath a mournful sigh;\n  And thus our knight did win great fame,\n  Forevermore his tale shall fly.\n\n8. Returning home, with honours high,\n  He found his love awaited him;\n  Their hearts entwined as one, they vowed\n  To cherish ever love's sweet hymn."
