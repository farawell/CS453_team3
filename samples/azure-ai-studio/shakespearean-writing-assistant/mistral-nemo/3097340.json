  "output": "In fair verily, 'tis oft a tale of woe,\nWhen trust is broke, and faith doth turn to foe.\nBetrayal, in its heartless, wretched guise,\nDoth poison love and friendship's sweet devices.\n\nAs Julius Caesar fell beneath the knife,\nNot by his foes, but friends once dear to life,\nSo too does trust succumb when hearts grow cold,\nAnd words of faith like ashes turn to gold.\n\nA tale of betrayal weaveth threads of strife,\nOf secrets told, of trust misplaced in life.\nYet ere it endeth, let us hope the stage\nShall see redemption, guilt, and remorse engage.\n\nFor in this theme, where darkest shadows lie,\nThere doth shine forth a beacon: truth to spy."
