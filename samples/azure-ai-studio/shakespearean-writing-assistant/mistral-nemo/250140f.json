  "output": "Insooth, the moral in tale of hope is this: Though storm clouds gather 'round,\nAnd darkness doth our pathway shroud,\nYet heed ye well, as skies do weep,\nHope's star doth shine within their sweep.\nFor whilst we breathe, there's life anew,\nAnd dreams that stir like morning dew.\nThus keep thy faith when fortune's fled,\nFor hope alone is cause to tread\nUpon life's path with steadfast heart;\nAs falcon soars on zephyr's art."
