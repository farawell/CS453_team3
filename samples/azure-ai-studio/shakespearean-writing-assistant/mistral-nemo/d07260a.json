  "output": "In fair Verona town there lived a knave,\nWhose heart was black as pitch, his soul depraved.\nHis name was Mercutio, once noble knight,\nYet fallen prey to vice's darkest night.\n\nA rogue and thief, he stole with impunity,\nHis crimes unchecked, his conscience free.\nBut lo, one fateful eve beneath the moon,\nHe met a maiden fair, by Fortune crooned.\n\nHer name was Juliet, her beauty rare,\nLike blossom blooming 'midst the winter's care.\nIn her sweet gaze, he saw redemption's gleam,\nA light that banished darkness, like a dream.\n\n\"Thou art my soul,\" she whispered soft and low,\n\"I'll save thee from thine own self-destructive glow.\"\nWith every word, his heart began to melt,\nFrom depths of sin, love's power did excel.\n\nHe vowed henceforth to cast off former ways,\nAnd strive towards the light that Juliet praise.\nYet still, old habits haunted him like shadows cast,\nTempting him back toward paths erstwhile embrac'd.\n\nBut love proved stronger than base appetites,\nGuiding him true, through day's bright lights.\nHe fought temptation, conquered sinful thought,\nHis journey to redemption slowly wrought.\n\nOne fateful night, as Juliet lay asleep,\nMercutio stole forth, his purpose deep.\nTo Romeo's house he went, with stealthy tread,\nAnd there he found that nobleman long dead.\n\nTaking his sword, he vowed to keep it safe,\nA symbol of the past he'd strive to escape.\nThen turning back toward Juliet's loving arms,\nHe cast off guilt and fears like mortal charms.\n\nAt last, redemption ne'er did seem so near,\nAs Mercutio knelt before his lady dear.\nHis journey done, his soul set free from stain,\nHe pledged his love anew, as day breaks in."
