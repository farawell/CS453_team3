  "output": "Verily, mine heart doth weigh heavy with regret,\nBut in this matter of honor's challenge, I must decline.\nNot from lack of courage or fear of perilous fate,\nBut rather 'tis my faith in peaceful resolution.\n\nLet not our hearts be steeled with hate nor swords unsheathed,\nFor words, though sharp as blades, have power to heal and sway.\nIn lieu of combat, let us meet on fields of discourse,\nAnd settle this discord with reason's steady hand.\n\nI trust thou wilt understand mine stance, dear foe,\nAnd in thy heart, find room for friendship once more."
