  "output": "Upon yonder hillock green doth sit\nA fair maiden fairer than the sky,\nHer tresses dark like raven's wing'd flight,\nAnd eyes that shine with stars' celestial sigh.\n\nThe lark ascends with melody divine,\nTo sing his matins to the morn anew;\nWhilst silver rills their whispered tales incline,\nIn gentle babble to the willows true.\n\nThe forests ancient, clad in emerald hue,\nDo whisper secrets to the zephyr soft,\nAnd dappled light doth dance on verdant view,\nAs through the leaves the sun doth gently aloft.\n\nO nature's beauty, thou art a sight\nThat stirreth mine heart with wond'rous delight!"
