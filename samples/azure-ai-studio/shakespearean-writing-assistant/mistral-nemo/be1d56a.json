  "output": "In realms where once proud towers did stand,\nThere lay a kingdom fair, now lost to sand.\nIts walls of stone, by time eroded,\nEchoed tales of glory long since moistened.\n\nA monarch wise did reign o'er verdant lands,\nHis wisdom vast as ocean's vast expanse.\n\"Fair subjects,\" quoth he, \"thy welfare's mine,\nIn joy and sorrow, thou art ever mine.\"\n\nYet pride doth breed deceitful seeds within,\nAnd in the royal court, a serpent slithers.\nA traitor vile did plot with venomous tongue,\nTo rend the kingdom asunder ere the sun\nHad set on eve of solstice's darkest night.\n\nThe king, betrayer warned by loyal knight,\nRode forth to face his foe 'neath moonlit sky,\nBut treachery's net was cast wide and sly.\nIn battle fierce, beset by enemies,\nOur sovereign fell, his kingdom lost with him.\n\nHis subjects scattered like leaves in autumn,\nTheir once-proud banners tattered, torn asunder.\nThe great halls silent stood, their stones weeping,\nAs shadows crept across the sunlit meadows.\n\nNo more did laughter echo through the courts,\nNor minstrels sing of ancient lore anew.\nNaught remained but memories haunting winds\nThat swept o'er empty fields where once grew grains.\n\nOh, kingdom lost! Thy tale doth chill our hearts,\nAnd teach us well to guard against deceit.\nYet still, like phoenix from its ashes rise,\nHope springs eternal in the human breast."
