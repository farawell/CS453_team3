  "output": "In realm where magic doth entwine,\nThere lived a maiden fair, a unicorn's kin,\nHer locks like silver, eyes that shimmered bright,\nYet cold her heart, by cruel fate did harden.\n\nForsook she once her true love, swift and fierce,\nHis heart she clave with words of bitter gall,\nUpon his dying breath, he cursed the sky,\n\"From henceforth, never sun shall warm thy face!\"\n\nLo! Eclipsed grew day, night's shroud descended,\nHer beauty wilted, like a rose untended.\nYet hope remained, for 'neath her window slept\nA dragon old, his scales like autumn leaves.\n\nTo dragon went the maiden, humbled low,\n\"Pray, ancient one,\" quoth she, \"what boon may break\nThis curse that hangs o'er my sorrowful head?\"\nDragon, with wisdom old as time itself,\n\n\"Love's flame can burn away coldest curse,\nYet doth such fire not burn without cause just.\nThou mustst love another true and pure,\nWithout thought of self or gain immure.\"\n\nWith heavy heart, she sought a humble knight,\nWhose love was steadfast, pure, and shining bright.\nAnd as she loved him, sun again took wing,\nIts golden rays upon her face did sing.\n\nThus learn we all, fair folken, ne'er forget:\nLove conquers all, both curse and shadow's dread."
