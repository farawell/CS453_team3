  "output": "Upon the sapphire canvas of the main,\nWhere Neptune doth his trident sway,\nDoth lie a realm of mystery untold,\nWhose secrets none canully convey.\n\nWhat mariners hath sailed those briny paths,\nAnd witnessed wonders unseen by land?\nThey speak of leviathans that slumber deep,\nTheir eyes like moons in darkness grand.\n\nThe sea hath singing sirens fair and foul,\nWho lure with melody the hapless soul.\nAnd ships entomb'd in watery tombs lie still,\nAs silent whispers from their timbers roll.\n\nWhat treasures lie concealed 'neath Neptune's reign?\nAnd what strange creatures yet await discovery?\nWe mortals scarce have scratched the surface wide,\nOf ocean's mysteries, endless store."
