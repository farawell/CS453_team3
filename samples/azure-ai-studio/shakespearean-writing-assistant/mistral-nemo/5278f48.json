  "output": "Upon yonder heavens' vast and twinkling stage,\nThe stars do dance, as lovers in embrace;\nYet not like they, for distance doth engage\nEach orb in lonely solitude, apace.\n\nBut lo! When night's velvet cloak doth wrap the earth,\nAnd shadows blend with silence's gentle sigh,\nThen from mine eyes doth steal a soft rebirth,\nAs stars above do mirror love's sweet lie.\n\nFor thou art as the morning star that shineth bright,\nGuiding lost souls through darkest hours anight;\nAnd like the evening star, thou gildest day's decline,\nBestowing warmth where once was cold and confine.\n\nOur hearts entwined like constellations fair,\nEternal in their love, forever there."
