  "output": "Upon mine heart, a bond doth closely grow,\nA tie of warmth that ebbs not with the sun;\nNot kin by blood, yet closer than those who show\nThe face of family in days undone.\n\nIn joyous times, thou art my merry sun,\nShining thy light upon my sorrows' face;\nAnd when I weep, thou art mine only one,\nWho seest me thus and loveth me apace.\n\nThou hast seen me at mine lowest ebb, yet still\nRemainst a faithful beacon in the night;\nMine honour, trust, and truest heart, thou fillst\nMy life with warmth, with hope's eternal light.\n\nSo here I pledge, till death doth us part:\nOur friendship shall, like stars, forever shine apart."
