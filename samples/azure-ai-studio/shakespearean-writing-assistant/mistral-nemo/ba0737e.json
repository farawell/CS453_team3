  "output": "In yonder ancient grove there stood a hut,\nWhere dwelled an sage, his wisdom old as oak,\nWhose beard did reach his toes, white as fresh snow,\nEyes held the depth of seas, vast, profound their look.\n\n\"Good morrow, venerable one,\" quoth I,\n\"What counsel hast thou to bestow on me?\"\nHe spake, his voice like thunder's rumble low,\nYet gentle as zephyr's breath in May.\n\n\"Thou seekest wisdom's path,\" quoth he, \"but see,\nIt lieth not in books alone nor yet\nIn words of men, be they wise or foolish.\n'Tis within thy heart, its beat thou knowst well.\"\n\nThen sage and I communed on life's great stage,\nOf love and loss, of joy and sorrow's pang,\nHis tales as old as time itself did flow,\nAnd in mine ear he planted seeds of wisdom."
