  "output": "In twilight's veil, where shadows weave their dance,\nLies Elderglen, a forest antique and vast.\nIts boughs entwine in ancient embrace, whilst leaves\nOf emerald hue do whisper secrets to the breeze.\n\nBy light of moon, the silvered path doth gleam,\nGuiding wand'ring feet through woods where fey do play.\nThe air is filled with melodies supreme,\nAs nature's minstrels sing both day and night.\n\nLo! Methinks I spied a creature strange and rare,\nWith coat as white as snow that doth fall in winter's reign.\nIts eyes did glow like embers burning bright,\nYet ne'er did harm befall those in its sight.\n\nFor 'tis said this beast, the unicorn divine,\nDoth lend its power to heal both mind and heart.\nIn Elderglen, such wonders dost abound,\nIf thou art pure of soul, thou shalt find them bound."
