  "output": "Upon the canvas of night's dark embrace,\nWhere stars do dance in ethereal grace,\nIllumed by thy loveliness once more,\nIn heavens' choir, thine voice I'd adore.\n\nThe silver threads from realms where thou dost dwell,\nBy my own eyes now softly feel.\nEach twinkling glimmer a tender kiss,\nA star's perpetual love and bliss.\n\nOh fair one, how the stars doth speak,\nOf thee alone in such sweet speech,\n\nTheir gentle whisper tells of thee,\nAs countless lovers have been seen to be.\nThus, as I gaze upon the night so bright,\nI vow my heart will ne'er forget."
