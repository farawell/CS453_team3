  "output": "My dearest Esteemed,\nTo accept the challenge of this duel would be to dishonor thee and myself in public eye.\nThou knowest well my heart hath no intent for such mortal conflict. Rather, I must plead that peace prevail in our discourse.\nRegrettably, my answer shall stand thus: thou mayest seek a different adversary, for none doth stand more ready than I to avoid this unsightly encounter.\nI offer thee this humble apology and respect as best I can when speech itself oft fails to ease the heart's lament."
