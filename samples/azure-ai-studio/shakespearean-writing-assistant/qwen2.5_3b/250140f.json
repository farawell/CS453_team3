  "output": "In tales where hope doth find its place,\nWhere hearts are broken yet not lost in space,\nWe often see as themes of joy and grace:\nFor in the darkest hours, hope is there to face.\n\nA beacon light it oft does shine,\nGuiding souls who wander through all time.\n'Tis seen by those in darkest plight,\nAnd brings them courage when they think themselves outlived.\n\nYet shall we say that all is well,\nThat hope alone doth bring us all our peace and heal?\nNot so, for hope, though bright and fair,\nIs tempered with the trials of despair.\n\nFor even as it guides our path,\nHope also asks us to pay.\nIt calls upon us to be strong,\nTo find within ourselves that wondrous song.\n\nThus, in its ways, it teaches well,\nOf what it is to truly dwell\nWithin the crucible of life's own tears and strife.\nTherefore, hope doth not alone bestow,\nBut rather, it doth teach the way.\n\nOft does it whisper calm and rest,\nAs shadows pass away at last;\nAnd in its wake doth leave a space,\nFor what true peace and tranquility can trace.\n\nSo, let us embrace this teaching well,\nOf how in hope's embrace we dwell.\nIt is within our very hearts that grace\nIs born, and from it doth we take our place."
