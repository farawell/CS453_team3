  "output": "Thou seest how bitter is the bite\nOf hate that doth within th' heart take its flight,\nAnd how deceitful are our hearts, oft times:\nA traitor's tongue will flatter as with honey flows.\nIn such a drama, we might explore themes\nOf trust betrayed, love lost in false disguise,\nAnd honor tarnished by the venom of spite.\n\nThou seest, how often is it thus?\nThe serpent bites the lamb, and virtue doth seem vile;\nFalsity takes on semblance of benign intent.\nThus, from a theme so deep and dark,\nWe glean lessons dire concerning men's hearts and their deeds."
