  "output": "In verdant fields where silver beams do twine,\nThou dost appear as graceful as a sheen,\nWith every step and turn, it seems we dive\nInto delights that sweet, yet subtle lie.\nThus dances gently o'er the velvet floor,\nOur steps in harmony with skies so clear.\nWhat nightingales we are! In song so free,\nThat music from each flutter doth ensue."
