  "output": "Once upon a time in a realm afar,\nThere dwelt a land where magic did mar,\nWithin its walls the fairest sights appear,\nOf wondrous creatures and of spells as clear.\n\nThis realm was known by all, for oft it heard\nThe whispers of old tales from the hearth.\nIn this grand domain, there lay a place\nWhere one might walk unchallenged night or day.\n\nThere stood a tower of glass-built height,\nIts surface reflecting light so bright.\nThrough its vast expanse did many come,\nTo gaze upon its gleaming girth.\n\nWithin this tower was an alcove known,\nThe source of all the realm's enchantment, \nWhere sat a guardian of old and wise,\nWho bore a staff with power to dispense.\n\nBy his decree it had been decreed\nThat only those who were true of heart might see.\nEach day did many more arrive,\nYet seldom was one granted this sight.\n\nThus did our tale take flight,\nNigh unto twilight's end, as dusk took its flight.\nA maiden came from far and wide,\nHer visage fair indeed, her voice a chime so fine.  \n\nShe sought to gain the realmâ€™s domain,\nBut her true worthness no man had known.\n\nAs she approached the tower at night,\nAnd with her hand did reach for light.\nThus she beheld this mystical sight,\nIts magic more than mortal man could withstand.\n\nFrom his throne within, the guardian did look down,\nUpon this questing maiden on her own.\nHe saw a heart of pure and true intent,\nWhich in many could not match or find.\n\nAnd thus he granted her her will,\nTo behold the marvels that her eye had filled.\nThus came to pass, upon her time there spent,\nHer gratitude was matched never more. \n\nAnd so from then on did she abide,\nWithin this realm, forevermore.\nFor though beyond its walls she wandered free,\nNever far her heart would stray.\n\nThis maiden's tale in lore shall be\nA beacon of hope and truth for all men brave."
