  "output": "O brave Sir Cedric, of honor and might,\nIn verdant glades didst thou adventure with gait.\nWith shield aloft and sword keenly bared,\nThou leaptest from thine quest, through strife and scarred war.\n\nThe woods whispered tales in the dim twilight's light,\nWhere shadows danced o'er mossy earth, not a sight.\nFrom perilous paths to gliding streams so fair,\nTo realms wherein brave beasts oft did their lair.\n\nSir Cedric, with heart bold as valor's own bedeque,\nFaced foes and dangers that none might conceive.\nWith every step, the land he trod became more strange,\nYet evermore his spirit was true and of flame.\n\nUpon this quest, Sir Cedric ne'er did repent to have gone,\nFor in thine journey, thou hast done much to be known.\nA knight who never fear'd nor held back or delay'd,\nBut strode with might on the path that doth thy name slay."
