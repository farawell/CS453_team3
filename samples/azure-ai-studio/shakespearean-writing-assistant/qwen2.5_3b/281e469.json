  "output": "In waters deep and dark where shadows dwell,\nThou art as veiled as secrets in night's helm.\nThe foam that dances light upon thy face,\nDoth hint at depths more still and secrets stale.\n\nThere, where the waves their ceaseless serenade,\nSeals with a seal of silence all who dare to roam.\nThrice has my heart unto those mysteries yearned,\nYet naught it hath beheld but sea's benign frown.\n\nThe sea, in her vast expanse, doth hide\nBoth treasures fair and horrors fraught within.\nShe whispers lore to him that may understand,\nAnd hides them from the gaze of vulgar sin."
