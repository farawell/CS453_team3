  "output": "In yonder days of ancient time past,\nThere dwelt a sage, whose wisdom did not lack,\nA philosopher, with lore untold,\nWhose eyes had learned from every dark and bright.\n\nHe wandered through the realms untroubled,\nWhere shadows danced upon the sunward lands,\nAnd winds whispered tales that were but heard,\nFor he alone could hear the secrets laid.\n\nHis temples stood at ebb and flow of seasons,\nA sacred spot, where time did cease to move.\nThere gathered many who sought his wisdom,\nSeeking counsel from a sage's profound,\n\nThough oft his ways were hidden in their heart,\nAnd oft they whispered not what it was that spoke,\nFor he whose tongue could speak the silent truth,\nWas ever held in awe as one of gods.\n\nTheir days did pass, and many a year went by,\nUnto the sage his wisdom still doth bear.\nYet even to this day, a tale remaineth,\nOf how from yonder sage men sought not only lore but also care."
