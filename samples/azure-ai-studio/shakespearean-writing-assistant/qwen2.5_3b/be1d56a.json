  "output": "Upon the plains of old Britannia, where once did flourish kingdoms, now lies but shadows of yore. A tale so dire as to be half forgotten in annals of time doth unfold.\n\nOnce, did reign a realm called Thynnoruth, whose borders stretched from green hills to sea's embrace. The people of that land were skilled in song and sword, and there was naught they could not achieve with their unyielding spirit. Their King, Valereius, though just and mighty, had eyes set upon lands beyond his own realm.\n\nThe tales of Thynnoruth are many, but the greatest is that which speaks of a fair maiden named Adeline. She was a beacon of beauty and grace in Thynnoruth's midst, her heart as pure as the azure skies above them.\n\nIt was rumored the King had eyes only for her, yet no man could say so without fear to his life. Yet Valereius, though he loved her well, sought not merely with one wife but a dominion beyond the bounds of Thynnoruth's land. He wished to marry many fair maidens, and take their lands in marriage as hostages to his own.\n\nIn the end, Adeline saw what was before her eyes, for all her grace could say otherwise. She knew that Valereius sought not her heart - only its riches. And so she fled from him, in sorrow of her kindred's plight. Her father and brothers both beseeched her to stay, but no plea did have power over the winds blowing cold through their home.\n\nThynnoruth fell into disarray after this departure, for without a King who held dominion over them all, they were at the mercy of marauders from far off lands. The once-thriving realm, rich in fields and treasure, now lay barren under skies dark with war and famine's scathe.\n\nAnd so it came to pass that Adeline returned not to her homeland again. For this is the tale of Thynnoruth, where a King's love for riches led to its ruin."
