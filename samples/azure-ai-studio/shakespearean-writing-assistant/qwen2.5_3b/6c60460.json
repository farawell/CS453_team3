  "output": "Within the realm where shadows dance and whispers weave,\nThere lies a wood, in mystery veiled with verdant leaves,\nIts borders thick as sentinels of ancient lore doth stand,\nWhere secrets whispered by the winds within its hallowed land.\n\nIn this enchanted glen, beneath a canopy so green,\nLies a silent kingdom of old, where dreams and deeds are seen.\nA path not tread by mortals, in twilight's softest light,\nGuides those who dare to venture forth into that sacred night.\n\nHere time doth halt its relentless pace, as if it must be seen,\nIn moments brief, profound and fraught with magic and serene.\nThe air is thick with fragrance of the rarest blooms outspread,\nAnd every branch does touch the sky in gentlest, fanned array.\n\nOft will one upon this path entreat a glance toward that height,\nTo see a form transfigure into mist, which softly doth subside.\nIts eyes are veiled and golden, in their light no shadow falls,\nOn those who dare to gaze where none should gape unbidden calls.\n\nYet caution ever hangs about, for peril lurks unseen and near,\nShould one but cross that line, a peril not easily discerned by ear.\nThus wanderers must be wise as well to tread with eyes aglow,\nFor in this realm, the boundaries of known doth softly shroud and sow."
