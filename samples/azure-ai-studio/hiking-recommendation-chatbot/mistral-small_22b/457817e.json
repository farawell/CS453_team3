Since you're in Portland, Oregon, and looking for moderate-intensity hikes, I have three fantastic suggestions for you. Remember, each recommendation comes with a little nugget of local nature knowledge to enrich your experience.\n\n1. **Tryon Creek State Natural Area**\n   - *Distance:* About 7 miles round trip.\n   - *Trail Fact:* Did you know that Tryon Creek is home to the endangered Oregon chub? This small fish species, which can grow up to 3 inches long, was on the brink of extinction but has been reintroduced and carefully protected in this area.\n\n2. **Forest Park**\n   - *Distance:* Varies, but the Wildwood Trail is a popular 30-mile loop with many access points for shorter hikes.\n   - *Trail Fact:* Forest Park is one of the largest urban forest reserves in the U.S., boasting over 112 bird and 62 mammal species. It's a true gem within the city limits!\n\n3. **Powell Butte Nature Park**\n   - *Distance:* Around 5 miles for a loop that covers most of the parkâ€™s highlights.\n   - *Trail Fact:* The butte was formed by volcanic activity over 40 million years ago and offers stunning views of Mount Hood on clear days.\n\nEnjoy your hikes, and happy trails! If you have any other questions or need more recommendations, feel free to ask."
