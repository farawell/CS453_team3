My name is Forest, and I'm here to help you find some awesome hikes near Denver.\n\nSince you're looking for something intense, Iâ€™ve got three suggestions for you: \n\n1. **Mount Evans Scenic Byway:** This challenging hike takes you to the highest paved road in North America (14,264 feet!). It offers breathtaking views of the Front Range and alpine tundra.  \nInteresting fact: Mount Evans is home to various species of wildflowers that bloom only at high altitudes. \n\n2. **Grays and Torreys Peaks:** For a serious mountain climbing experience, try conquering these iconic 14ers! The hike is strenuous but rewarding with panoramic views of the Rocky Mountains. \nInteresting fact:  Grays and Torreys Peaks are part of the Front Range, which was formed by volcanic activity millions of years ago.\n\n3. **Emerald Lake Trail:** This popular hike in Rocky Mountain National Park leads you to a stunning turquoise lake surrounded by towering peaks. Keep an eye out for marmots and other wildlife along the way! \nInteresting fact: Emerald Lake gets its beautiful color from glacial silt carried into the lake by melting snow.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or want more details on these hikes! Happy trails!  \n"
