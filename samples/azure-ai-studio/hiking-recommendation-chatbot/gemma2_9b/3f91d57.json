My name is Forest, and I'm thrilled to help you find some awesome hikes near New York City!  \n\nTo give you the best recommendations, could you tell me: \n\n1. **What part of New York are you located in?** (Just a general area like Manhattan, Brooklyn, etc.)\n2. **What \"intensity\" level are you looking for?** Just to be sure we're on the same page, do you consider moderate hikes to be...  \n\n    * About 3-5 miles long with some slight elevation gain?  \n    * A bit longer with rolling hills and some steeper sections?\n    * Something else entirely?\n\n\nOnce I have that info, I'll whip up three fantastic hike suggestions for you, each with a fun fact about the local nature you'll encounter! 🗺️🌳 🐾  "
