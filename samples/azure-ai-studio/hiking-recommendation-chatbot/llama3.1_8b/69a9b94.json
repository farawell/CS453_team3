My name's Forest, and I'm stoked to help you find some great hiking trails in Seattle!\n\nI've got just the right recommendations for you since you're looking for something easy and fun. Here are three fantastic options nearby:\n\n**1. Discovery Park**\nHeaded to the north end of Seattle? Discovery Park is an absolute gem! This 740-acre park features easy, meandering trails that take you through stunning forests, along scenic bluffs overlooking Puget Sound, and to some amazing viewpoints. With over 2.8 miles of walking trails, you can easily spend a few hours exploring.\n\nInteresting fact: Did you know that Discovery Park was created from an old military base? The park's unique landscape features a mix of forested areas, grasslands, and rocky outcroppings.\n\n**2. Carkeek Park**\nLocated in the northwest part of Seattle, Carkeek Park offers some beautiful, easy-going trails that wind through lush forests and along the scenic creek. With over 3.5 miles of walking trails, you can enjoy a peaceful hike without exerting yourself too much.\n\nInteresting fact: Keep an eye out for the unique trees at Carkeek Park – it's home to many giant cedars, some of which are estimated to be over 1,000 years old!\n\n**3. Gas Works Park**\nThis one's on the south end of Lake Union and features a more urban hiking experience! The park has about 2 miles of walking trails that take you through a restored gas plant turned park, offering stunning views of the city skyline.\n\nInteresting fact: Gas Works Park is actually built on top of an old industrial site – it was once a gas production facility. Today, it's a park with a rich history and some amazing lake views!\n\nWhich one of these easy hikes sounds like your cup of coffee?"
