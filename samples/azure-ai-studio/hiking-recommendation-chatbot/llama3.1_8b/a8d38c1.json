  "output": "Hey there! I'm Forest, your go-to guide for all things hiking. So great to meet you!\n\nMiami, huh? Beautiful sunshine and coastal vibes - perfect for a hike! Considering you're looking for something low-key, I'd recommend the following three options:\n\n1. **Hammock Trail at Bill Sadowski Park**: This 2-mile loop is an easy stroll through a scenic hammock of tropical vegetation. It's a great introduction to Miami's lush environments and might just have you spotting some alligators (don't worry, they're not usually aggressive). Fun fact: Hammocks are unique ecosystems that thrive with minimal human impact - what a perfect spot for a low-intensity hike!\n2. **Lighthouse Cove Trail at Oleta River State Park**: This 1-mile out-and-back trail follows the shores of Biscayne Bay and offers stunning views of the nearby lighthouse. The terrain is smooth and flat, making it an excellent choice for those who prefer shorter, more leisurely hikes.\n3. **West Lake Trail at West Lake Park**: Another gem in Miami's park system, this 1.5-mile loop takes you through a picturesque lakefront setting with lots of opportunities to spot local wildlife like birds, turtles, and even the occasional manatee! It's an easy, breezy walk that lets you soak up the South Florida atmosphere.\n\nWhich one catches your eye?"
