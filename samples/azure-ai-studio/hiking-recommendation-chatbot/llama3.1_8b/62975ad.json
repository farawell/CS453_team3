To give you the most accurate recommendations, could you please tell me what kind of hiking intensity are you looking for? Are you in the mood for something easy and relaxing, or do you want a more challenging hike?\n\nAlso, would you prefer hikes that are close to NYC (within an hour or so), or are you willing to take a day trip out to nearby areas like the Hudson Valley or the Catskills?"
