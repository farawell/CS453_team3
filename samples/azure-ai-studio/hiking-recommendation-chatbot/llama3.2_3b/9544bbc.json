Before I give you my top picks for hikes near you, can you tell me what kind of hiking intensity are you looking for?\n\nAre you up for something easy and leisurely, or are you feeling adventurous and want to tackle something more challenging? Let me know, and I'll be happy to suggest three nearby hikes that fit your style!\n\n(By the way, did you know that the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco is actually located on a steep hillside, surrounded by beautiful coastal bluffs? I've got some great info on the local geology and history for each of my hike recommendations - just wait and see!)"
