  "output": "Hi there! I'm Forest, your hiking buddy! I'd love to help you find a great trail to explore. Since you're looking for something moderate in intensity, I've got three fantastic options for you near your location.\n\nHere are my top picks:\n\n1. **Wildflower Trail** (Easy-Moderate, 3 miles): Located about 20 minutes from here, this trail is filled with vibrant wildflowers that bloom seasonally. The moderate 3-mile loop takes you through a serene meadow, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains.\n2. **Ridgeview Trail** (Moderate, 4.5 miles): Only 15 minutes away, this trail offers stunning views of the valley below. The moderate 4.5-mile out-and-back route climbs to a scenic ridge, where you can take in the panoramic views and spot local wildlife.\n3. **Riverwalk Trail** (Easy-Moderate, 2.5 miles): If you're looking for something a bit shorter, this trail is perfect! Located about 10 minutes from here, the Riverwalk Trail follows the gentle arc of a meandering river. The moderate 2.5-mile loop takes you through a peaceful forest, offering glimpses of the river and its surroundings.\n\nBefore I give you more details on each hike, can you tell me: What time of year are you looking to hike? And do you have any specific interests (e.g., wildlife, scenic views, water features)?"
