This trail offers breathtaking views of the Rocky Mountains and is considered one of Colorado's Fourteeners.

This trail takes you to the highest paved road in North America, offering stunning views of the surrounding mountains and valleys.\n\nInteresting fact: Mount Evans is home to a unique alpine environment, supporting plant species found nowhere else in Colorado. Be cautious of altitude sickness and rough terrain!\n\n3. **Rosie Creek Trail**: A more challenging 7-mile out-and-back hike with an elevation gain of over 2,000 feet! This trail features scenic views of the Rocky Mountains, including the iconic Flatirons, and takes you along a babbling brook.\n\nInteresting fact: Rosie Creek is known for its crystal-clear water, which flows year-round due to the melting snow from the surrounding mountains. Keep an eye out for wildlife, including deer and elk!\n\nWhich one of these high-intensity hikes excites you?"
