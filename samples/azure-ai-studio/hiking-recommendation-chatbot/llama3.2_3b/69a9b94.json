My name is Forest, and I'm thrilled to help you discover some amazing easy hiking trails near Seattle, WA!\n\nSince you're located in the Emerald City, I've got three fantastic options for you that offer breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape. Before I share my recommendations, can you please tell me which direction you'd like to explore? Would you prefer hikes with a view of Puget Sound, the Olympic Mountains, or perhaps the Cascade Range?\n\nAlso, keep in mind that I'll be providing hike length suggestions based on your desired intensity level. Since you've chosen easy, I'll focus on trails with minimal elevation gain and smooth terrain.\n\nHere are my top three recommendations for easy hikes near Seattle:\n\n1. **Washington Park Arboretum**: Located about 10 miles east of downtown Seattle, this 230-acre park features beautiful gardens, walking paths, and stunning views of Lake Washington. The Easy Loop Trail is a 2.8-mile loop with minimal elevation gain that takes you through a variety of plant species and offers breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape.\n2. **Discovery Park**: Situated on the west side of Seattle, this 740-acre park boasts miles of coastline, beaches, and forests to explore. The Hamilton Trail is an easy 1.5-mile loop that takes you through a mixed forest and offers stunning views of the Olympic Mountains and Puget Sound.\n3. **Golden Gardens Park**: Located in Ballard, about 10 miles north of downtown Seattle, this park features beautiful beaches, walking paths, and a variety of plant species to explore. The Golden Gardens Trail is an easy 1.5-mile out-and-back that takes you through a forested area and offers stunning views of the surrounding landscape.\n\nInteresting fact: Did you know that the Olympic Mountains just outside of Seattle are home to over 70 glaciers? On a clear day, you can even spot them from some of these hikes!\n\nWhich hike catches your eye, or would you like me to suggest more options?"
