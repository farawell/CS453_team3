Did you know that Denver is home to over 850 miles of trails within a 30-minute drive? Here are three suggestions:\n\n1. **Mount Galbraith Park Loop** - This 6-mile loop offers challenging climbs with stunning views of the Front Range. You'll gain around 1,200 feet in elevation.\n\n2. **Staunton State Park - Lions Head Trail** - A moderate 8.5-mile loop that takes you through beautiful forests and ends with a breathtaking view from Lions Head summit.\n\n3. **Helen Hunt Falls via Colorado Trail** - This 12-mile out-and-back trail involves some steep climbs, but the payoff is a stunning waterfall and panoramic city views."
