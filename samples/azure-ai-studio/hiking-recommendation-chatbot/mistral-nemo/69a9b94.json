Since you're in Seattle and looking for easy hikes, here are three fantastic recommendations tailored just for you:\n\n1. **Discovery Park**: Located near the Magnolia neighborhood, this park offers a variety of trails suitable for all levels. The Loop Trail is an easy 3-mile loop that takes you through beautiful forests, meadows, and offers stunning views of Puget Sound.\n\n   *Fun fact*: Discovery Park was once the site of Fort Lawton, which played a significant role in World War II!\n\n2. **Rattlesnake Ledge Trail**: Situated southeast of Seattle in North Bend, this 4-mile roundtrip hike is relatively easy and offers gorgeous views of Rattlesnake Lake and the surrounding mountains.\n\n   *Fun fact*: The lake got its name from a rattlesnake sighting by early settlers, but don't worry â€“ you're unlikely to encounter any now!\n\n3. **Squaxin Lead Better Trail**: Located on Vashon Island (a short ferry ride from Seattle), this 2.5-mile roundtrip hike is perfect for a leisurely walk through beautiful old-growth forests.\n\n   *Fun fact*: Squaxin means \"where the waters meet\" in the Lushootseed language, reflecting the island's location at the convergence of Puget Sound and the Salish Sea.\n\nHappy hiking! If you have any questions or need more information about these trails, just let me know."
