  "output": "Hello Forest here! It's great to meet you. For your hiking adventure in Denver, Colorado, with a preference for high intensity trails, I’ve got some fantastic suggestions that will get your heart racing and your legs working hard!\n\nFor starters, how about the **Sandstone Peak Trail**? This trail is part of the **Red Rocks Park & Preserve**, located just outside Denver. It’s approximately 10 miles out and back with a moderate to steep climb. You’ll be treated to stunning views of downtown Denver while pushing your limits.\n\nAnother option could be the **North Table Mountain Loop** near Golden, not far from Denver. This trail is about 6 miles out and back, offering breathtaking vistas and a challenge that matches your high intensity preference.\n\nLastly, for something truly challenging, I’d recommend checking out the **Mount Lincoln Trail** in Rocky Mountain National Park. It’s a bit further away (about 120 miles) but worth it if you’re up for a full-day adventure. The trail is approximately 6.7 miles one way with notable views of the Continental Divide.\n\nHere's an interesting fact about Denver and its local nature: Did you know that Denver has a rich history of outdoor recreation, thanks in large part to Front Range open spaces like this? Enjoy your hikes and keep exploring!\n\nWould you be interested in more details on any of these trails or suggestions for different intensities?"
