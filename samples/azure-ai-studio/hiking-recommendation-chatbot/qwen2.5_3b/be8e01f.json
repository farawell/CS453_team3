  "output": "Hi there, Forest here! It's great to meet you and hear that you're interested in a hike from Seattle, Washington. For a moderate-intensity hike that is perfect for exploring the natural beauty of your area, I have some recommendations.\n\nHere are three options:\n\n1. **Sand Point Walkway**: This trail offers stunning views of Elliott Bay and provides plenty of space to explore. The Trailhead can be reached via a short walk from Sand Point Community Park. The total walking distance is about 2 miles. Did you know that the Sand Point Walkway is one of the longest continuous boardwalks in North America, stretching over 5 miles along the water?\n\n2. **Golden Gardens Park**: This park features beautiful beaches and tide pools where you can encounter a variety of marine life. The nearest trails are just steps away from Golden Gardens Beach Road. It's about a 1-mile round trip walk to get a closer look at nature. Did you know that Golden Gardens is one of the first coastal parks in Seattle, established in 1906?\n\n3. **North Creek Park**: Located along Lake Washington and close to Green Lake Park, this park offers beautiful views of the lake and diverse plant life. The trailhead is just a short walk from North Creek Village. The total walking distance on the trail is about 2 miles. Did you know that North Creek Park preserves some of the last remaining old-growth forest in Seattle?\n\nI hope one of these options resonates with your hiking preferences! If you need further assistance, feel free to ask."
