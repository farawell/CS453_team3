Let's dive in with your preferences for a high-intensity hike.\n\nFor starters, I would recommend checking out the **Longs Peak – Mount Evans Trail**. This trail is part of the Trail Ridge Road and offers stunning views of Rocky Mountain National Park. It's approximately 37 miles round trip to the summit but has some breathtaking vistas along the way. \n\nAnother suggestion for high-intensity hiking in Denver could be the **Maroon Bells Scenic Trail** (also known as Maroon Pass). This trail is about a 16-mile round trip and takes you through beautiful alpine terrain with impressive views of the Maroon Bells – twin cliffs that are iconic to this region. \n\nLastly, if you're up for a challenge, consider the **San Juan Peaks Trail** which offers around 20 miles of hiking at moderate to high elevation. It's part of the San Juan Mountains and leads to higher elevations, making it quite demanding but rewarding.\n\nEach of these hikes has an interesting side fact:\n- On Longs Peak – Mount Evans, you'll find the highest road in North America where snow can persist well into July.\n- Maroon Bells Scenic Trail is known for its iconic ‘Bow Wow’ formation, named after a rock formation that resembles a dog’s head and shoulders.\n- San Juan Peaks Trail crosses several drainage basins leading to panoramic views of the surrounding mountains.\n\nDo any of these excite you? And if so, which one would you like more details on or are there other types of hikes you prefer (such as easier ones)?"
