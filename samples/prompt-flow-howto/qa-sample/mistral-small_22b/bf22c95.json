  "output": " Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy! Here's a brief breakdown: 🌞\n\n1. **Light-dependent reactions**: Chlorophyll in plant cells absorbs light, and this energy is used to split water molecules (H₂O), releasing oxygen (O₂) as a waste product.\n2. **Light-independent reactions** (Calvin cycle): The energy from the light-dependent reactions is used to convert carbon dioxide (CO₂) into glucose (sugar), which the plant uses for food and growth. 🍃\n\nPretty neat, huh? Nature's own power plant! 😊"
