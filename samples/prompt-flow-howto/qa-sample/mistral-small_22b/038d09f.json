  "output": " Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It introduces concepts like wave-particle duality, superposition, and entanglement, which challenge our everyday intuition but are crucial for understanding how the universe works at its most basic level. ðŸš€"
