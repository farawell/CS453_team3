  "output": " Sure, let's break down how the human digestive system works! üçΩÔ∏è\n\n1. **Mouth**: Digestion begins here when you chew your food, breaking it down into smaller pieces. Saliva in your mouth helps to start the chemical breakdown of starches.\n\n2. **Esophagus**: Once chewed and mixed with saliva, food travels through the esophagus to the stomach by a process called peristalsis‚Äîwavelike muscle contractions.\n\n3. **Stomach**: The stomach uses hydrochloric acid and enzymes to further break down the food into a soup-like mixture called chyme. This helps in killing bacteria and denaturing proteins.\n\n4. **Small Intestine**: The chyme then moves into the small intestine, where most of the digestion and absorption occur. Enzymes secreted by the pancreas and bile from the liver help break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Nutrients are absorbed through the walls of the intestine.\n\n5. **Large Intestine**: What‚Äôs left after the nutrients have been absorbed moves into the large intestine (colon). The primary function here is to absorb water from the remaining food waste and prepare it for elimination as feces.\n\n6. **Rectum and Anus**: Finally, the waste material is stored in the rectum until it's eliminated through the anus during a bowel movement.\n\nAnd that's how our body processes the food we eat! üß†"
