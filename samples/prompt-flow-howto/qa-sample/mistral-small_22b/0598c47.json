  "output": " Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates underneath the Earth's surface suddenly shift, causing the ground above them to shake. These shifts can happen along fault lines, which are areas where two of these massive plates meet. There are three main types of earthquakes based on their origin: tectonic (caused by plate movements), volcanic (triggered by magma movement), and explosion-related (resulting from human activities like mining or nuclear testing). ðŸŒŽðŸ’¥"
