  "output": " ðŸ¦© Why are flamingos pink?\n\nFlamingos get their pink color from the carotenoids in their diet! These chemicals, including canthaxanthin and astaxanthin, are responsible for the vibrant hues. Interestingly, they also play a role in maintaining the bird's health, affecting its immune system and even influencing mate selection. Isn't that fascinating? ðŸŒº"
