  "output": " Alrighty! The Theory of Relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, is actually two related theories:\n\n1. **Special Relativity**: This one focuses on objects moving at constant speeds. It's famous for its equation \\( E=mc^2 \\), which shows the relationship between mass and energy. Special Relativity also introduces the idea that time can slow down or speed up depending on how fast you're moving relative to something else. 🕰️🌟\n\n2. **General Relativity**: This theory deals with gravity as a property of space and time, or spacetime. It says that massive objects cause a distortion in spacetime, which we perceive as gravity. Think of it like a heavy ball placed on a stretched rubber sheet—the ball causes the sheet to curve around it. 🌍💫\n\nTogether, these theories have revolutionized our understanding of the universe! If you've got more questions, just let me know! 😊"
