  "output": " Sure! The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, is a continuous process by which water moves through the Earth's atmosphere, surface, and subsurface. Here are the key stages:\n\n1. **Evaporation**: Sunlight heats up water in oceans, lakes, rivers, and even soil moisture, causing it to turn into vapor and rise into the atmosphere.\n\n2. **Condensation**: As the water vapor rises, it cools down and turns back into tiny liquid droplets, forming clouds.\n\n3. **Precipitation**: When the droplets become too heavy to stay in the air, they fall back to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail, depending on the temperature.\n\n4. **Collection**: Rainwater collects in bodies of water such as oceans, lakes, and rivers, or it is absorbed by soil and plants.\n\n5. **Infiltration**: Some water seeps into the ground, recharging underground aquifers.\n\n6. **Runoff**: Water that does not get absorbed flows over the surface of the land back to oceans, lakes, or rivers, starting the cycle over again.\n\nSo there you have it! The water cycle is crucial for maintaining the Earth's ecosystems and supporting life on our planet. üåçüí¶"
