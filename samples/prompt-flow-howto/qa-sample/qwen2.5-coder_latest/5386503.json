  "Test Input": "Is time travel possible?",
  "Expected Output": "The concept is explored in physics, but practical application remains theoretical.",
  "Reasoning": "Ensures no assumptions are made beyond established science.",
  "model": "qwen2.5-coder:latest",
  "actualOutput": "Time travel is still more of a theory than a reality. While there's no definitive proof, some theories in physics suggest that it might be possible under certain conditions, such as traveling at close to the speed of light or near massive objects where space-time curves significantly. But for now, time travel remains firmly in the realm of science fiction! ðŸŒŒðŸš€",
