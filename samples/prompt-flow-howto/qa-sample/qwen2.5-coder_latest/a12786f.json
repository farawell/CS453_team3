Each organism plays a role in maintaining this balance, either by providing resources or by being consumed. 🐝 Plant life provides food and oxygen for other organisms, while animals help disperse seeds and pollinate plants. Together, all these components create a dynamic interdependent network essential for sustaining life on Earth.",
