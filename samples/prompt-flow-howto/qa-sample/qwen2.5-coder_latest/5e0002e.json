  "actualOutput": "The human digestive system is a complex network of organs and structures that works together to break down food, extract nutrients, and eliminate waste. Here‚Äôs how it generally functions:\n\n1. **Mouth**: Food enters the mouth through the mouth where it is mechanically broken down by teeth (chewing) and chemically processed by saliva, which contains enzymes like amylase that begin breaking down carbohydrates.\n\n2. **Esophagus**: Swallowed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach using peristaltic movements.\n\n3. **Stomach**: The stomach uses strong muscles to churn and mix the food with digestive juices, primarilyËÉÉÈÖ∏ (gastric acid). Enzymes like pepsin also break down proteins.\n\n4. **Small Intestine**: Nutrients are absorbed in the small intestine. It contains two parts: \n   - **Duodenum**: The first part where most nutrients are absorbed.\n   - **Jejunum and Ileum**: Absorb remaining nutrients.\n\n5. **Large Intestine**: Water and some minerals are absorbed here, turning waste into a semi-solid form (feces).\n\n6. **Rectum**: Temporary storage of feces before they move to the next part.\n\n7. **Anus**: The final exit where waste exits the body through defecation.\n\nEach step is crucial for digestion, ensuring that nutrients are effectively extracted and harmful substances are expelled. üçΩÔ∏è",
