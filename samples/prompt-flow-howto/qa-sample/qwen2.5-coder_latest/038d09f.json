  "Test Input": "What is quantum mechanics?",
  "Expected Output": "Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics dealing with phenomena...",
  "Reasoning": "Checks for formal language and presentation.",
  "model": "qwen2.5-coder:latest",
  "actualOutput": "Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. This field uses principles of probability and uncertainty, which means that not all properties of a particle can be precisely known at the same time. It includes the famous Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that you cannot simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle.\n\nQuantum mechanics was developed in the early 20th century to explain phenomena that were not understandable by classical physics, such as the structure of atoms and the behavior of electrons. Its principles are fundamental to many areas of modern technology, including semiconductors, lasers, and MRI machines.",
