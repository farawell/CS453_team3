  "actualOutput": "The Theory of Relativity is a set of two theories developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century: the Special Theory of Relativity and the General Theory of Relativity.\n\n### Special Theory of Relativity (1905)\nThe Special Theory of Relativity deals with objects moving at constant speeds, particularly those approaching the speed of light. The key postulates include:\n1. **Principle of Relativity**: The laws of physics are uniformly valid in all inertial frames of reference.\n2. **Speed of Light Constancy**: The speed of light is constant and independent of the motion of the source or observer.\n\nFrom these principles, several fascinating consequences arise:\n- **Time Dilation**: Time appears to pass slower for an object moving at high speeds relative to a stationary observer.\n- **Length Contraction**: Objects in motion appear shorter along the direction of motion as observed from a stationary frame.\n- **Mass-Energy Equivalence**: Matter and energy are interchangeable, expressed by the equation \\( E = mc^2 \\).\n\n### General Theory of Relativity (1915)\nThe General Theory of Relativity extends the principles of Special Relativity to accelerating frames of reference and gravity. It posits:\n1. **Equivalence Principle**: Gravity is not a force but a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.\n\nThis theory predicts several phenomena:\n- **Gravitational Waves**: Ripples in spacetime created by massive objects accelerating through space.\n- **Black Holes**: Regions from which nothing can escape, including light, due to intense gravitational pull.\n- **Gravitational Lensing**: The bending of light by gravity, causing stars and galaxies to appear magnified or distorted.\n\n### Applications\nThe predictions of General Relativity have been confirmed and tested repeatedly:\n- GPS satellites must account for time dilation and the curvature of spacetime.\n- Accurately predicted gravitational waves from merging black holes were detected in 2015.\n- The shape of the universe has also been influenced by theories of relativity.\n\nIn essence, the Theory of Relativity fundamentally changed our understanding of space, time, gravity, and causality.",
