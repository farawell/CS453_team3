  "Test Input": "What causes earthquakes?",
  "Expected Output": "Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust...",
  "Reasoning": "Evaluates detailed response explaining the phenomenon.",
  "model": "qwen2.5-coder:latest",
  "actualOutput": "Earthquakes occur due to the constant movement of tectonic plates on Earth's surface. These massive slabs of rock, floating on the semi-fluid layer beneath them (the asthenosphere), are in a state of constant motion, driven by convection and heat from deep within the Earth.\n\nThe energy produced as these plates move causes stress to build up along their edges. This build-up occurs because the plates do not always move smoothly; sometimes they get stuck or slide past each other slowly. When too much stress accumulates and the rocks can't hold it any longer, a sudden release of energy occurs, causing an earthquake.\n\nHere’s how earthquakes happen:\n1. **Stress Accumulation**: Tectonic plates push, pull, or slide against each other, building up stress.\n2. **Fault Lines**: Stress becomes concentrated along boundaries where plates meet (fault lines).\n3. **Elastic Rebound Theory**: When too much stress builds up and the rocks can't stretch any further, they snap back suddenly. This sudden release of energy travels through the Earth in the form of seismic waves, causing an earthquake.\n\nDifferent types of earthquakes occur due to various conditions:\n- **Tsunamis**: Caused by large underwater landslides or earthquakes near the ocean floor.\n- **Volcanic Earthquakes**: Triggered by volcanic activity like magma movement or gas release.\n- **Induced Earthquakes**: Caused by human activities such as oil and gas extraction, reservoir蓄水, or waste injection.\n\nUnderstanding these causes helps in predicting earthquakes better and implementing measures to mitigate their impact.",
