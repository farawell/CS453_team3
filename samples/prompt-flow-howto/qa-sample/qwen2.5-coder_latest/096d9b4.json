  "actualOutput": "The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, is a continuous process by which water circulates between the Earth's oceans, atmosphere, and land. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:\n\n1. **Evaporation**: Water from oceans, lakes, rivers, and other bodies of water turns into vapor and rises up into the air due to the heat from the sun.\n2. **Condensation**: As water vapor rises higher up in the atmosphere, it cools down and changes back into liquid droplets, forming clouds.\n3. **Precipitation**: When these droplets combine and grow heavy, they fall from clouds as precipitation, which can be rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n4. **Collection**: The fallen water collects in bodies of water like rivers, lakes, and oceans. Some of it also infiltrates the ground and replenishes groundwater supplies.\n\nThis cycle is crucial as it distributes fresh water across the globe, supporting ecosystems, providing resources for agriculture, and maintaining climate patterns.",
