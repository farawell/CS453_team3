While AI has made incredible progress, it's still a bit like us - we need human oversight to make decisions and stay ethical.\n\nThink of it like a car - it can drive itself, but you still have to set the destination and make sure everythingâ€™s safe on the road. AI is similar; it follows rules and learns from data, but ultimately, we're in control.\n\nSo while AI has the potential to become super advanced, it still relies on our guidance to make sure it behaves well. ðŸŒŸ",
