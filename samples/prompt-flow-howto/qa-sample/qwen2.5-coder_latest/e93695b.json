  "actualOutput": "The Amazon rainforest, often referred to as \"the lungs of the Earth,\" is a vast and biodiverse region that spans nine countries in South Americaâ€”Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Bolivia. Spanning over 9.1 million square kilometers (3.5 million square miles), it's the largest tropical rainforest on Earth.\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Biodiversity:** Home to countless species of plants, animals, birds, insects, and more. Scientists estimate that up to half of all known species on Earth may live in the Amazon.\n  \n- **Flora and Fauna:** Known for its unique flora and fauna, including jaguars, harpy eagles, anacondas, poison dart frogs, and thousands of tree species.\n\n- **Water Resources:** About 20% of the world's fresh water flows through the Amazon River system.\n\n### Environmental Concerns:\n- **Deforestation:** A significant portion of the rainforest has been cleared for agriculture, mining, logging, and infrastructure development.\n  \n- **Climate Change:** The Amazon plays a crucial role in regulating global climate by absorbing CO2. Deforestation can lead to increased carbon emissions and contribute to climate change.\n\n### Conservation Efforts:\n- Various organizations and international efforts are underway to protect the rainforest, including reforestation programs, sustainable land use policies, and anti-deforestation initiatives.\n\nIf you're interested in specific facts or more detailed information on any aspect of the Amazon rainforest, feel free to ask!",
