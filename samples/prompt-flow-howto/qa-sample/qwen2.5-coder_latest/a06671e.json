  "actualOutput": "Sure! The states of matter are three: **solid**, **liquid**, and **gas**. Each state has distinct properties:\n\n- **Solid**: In a solid, particles are tightly packed together with minimal movement. They have a fixed shape and volume. Examples include ice, rock, and metals.\n\n- **Liquid**: Liquids have particles that can move around each other but remain relatively close to one another. They take the shape of their container and have a fixed volume. Water is an example of a liquid.\n\n- **Gas**: Gases have particles that are far apart and moving freely in all directions. They expand to fill any container they occupy and have neither a fixed shape nor volume. Air is an example of a gas.",
