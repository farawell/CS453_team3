  "actualOutput": "Flamingos get their pink color from the food they eat! 😊 Their diet mainly consists of tiny shrimp-like creatures called brine shrimp and algae, which contain a pigment called beta-carotene. This pigment is converted into red or orange pigments in the birds' bodies and gives them their distinctive pink feathers.\n\nSo, it's not magic—just a tasty meal that makes flamingos look like they're wearing a pink dress-up! 🌸",
