  "Test Input": "Can penguins fly?",
  "Expected Output": "No, penguins are flightless birds.",
  "Reasoning": "Ensures factual statements without assumptions.",
  "model": "qwen2.5-coder:latest",
  "actualOutput": "No, penguins can't fly! 🐧 They're flightless birds that are adapted for swimming and living in icy environments. Their bodies are shaped like streamlined rockets for the water, but they don't have wings that allow them to fly through the air. Instead, they use their strong legs to 'paddle' through the water with incredible speed. So while penguins can't fly, they're very skilled at swimming and maneuvering in the ocean! 🌊",
