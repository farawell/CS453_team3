  "actualOutput": "Sure! üå± Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and energy in the form of sugar. Here‚Äôs how it works:\n\n1. **Absorption of Light**: Chlorophyll, a pigment found in chloroplasts (structures inside plant cells), absorbs light primarily from blue and red wavelengths.\n\n2. **Water Splitting (Photolysis)**: The absorbed light energy is used to split water molecules into oxygen, protons, and electrons. Oxygen is released as a byproduct; protons and electrons are used to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH.\n\n3. **Carbon Dioxide Fixation**: In the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is taken in and converted into glucose through a series of chemical reactions facilitated by enzymes. This process uses the ATP and NADPH generated during the light-dependent reactions.\n\n4. **Glucose Production**: The final step involves using energy stored in ATP and NADPH to convert simple molecules like 3-phosphoglycerate into glucose and other sugars.\n\nSo, in essence, photosynthesis helps plants produce their own food while also providing oxygen for us to breathe! üåç‚ú®",
