This expansion was first observed by Edwin Hubble in 1929, and since then, we've confirmed it through various observations and experiments.\n\nAs galaxies move away from each other, they're not just drifting apart – they're actually stretching out like rubber bands! This expansion is happening at a rate of about 1 kilometer per second per megaparsec. That's really fast!\n\nSo, what does this mean for us? Well, it means that the universe is constantly changing and evolving, and there's still so much to explore and discover 🔍.\n\nWould you like to learn more space facts? 🤔"
