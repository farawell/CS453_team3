According to [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/nasahqorg/nope-the-sun-is-not-a-planet), our solar system has 8 planets (Mercury to Neptune) and the sun is the center of it all as a massive ball of hot, glowing gas. So, while the sun is super important for us planet-dwellers, it's not a planet itself ðŸŒŠ"
