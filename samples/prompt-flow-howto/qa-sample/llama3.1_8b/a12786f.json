It's like a big team working together! ðŸ‘«\n\n* **Living components**: Plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms (like bacteria and algae) that live in the ecosystem.\n* **Non-living components**: Water, air, soil, sunlight, and minerals that provide what living things need to survive.\n\nThink of it like a big house with many rooms. Each room has its own special function, but they all work together to create a comfortable home. In an ecosystem, all the living and non-living \"rooms\" work together to support life! ðŸŒ¸"
