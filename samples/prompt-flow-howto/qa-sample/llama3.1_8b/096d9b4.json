It's a vital process that sustains all life on Earth! 🌸\n\nHere's a brief overview:\n\n### **Step 1: Evaporation 💧**\nWater from oceans, lakes, rivers, and the ground surface evaporates into the atmosphere as water vapor. This happens when the temperature and humidity are just right.\n\n### **Step 2: Condensation ☁️**\nAs water vapor rises into the air, it cools down and condenses into tiny droplets, forming clouds.\n\n### **Step 3: Precipitation 🌂**\nWhen the clouds become saturated with water, precipitation occurs in various forms - rain, snow, sleet, or hail. This water falls back to the Earth's surface!\n\n### **Step 4: Runoff and Infiltration 💧**\nOnce the precipitation reaches the ground, some of it flows over the surface as runoff, eventually returning to bodies of water. The rest seeps into the soil and becomes groundwater.\n\n### **Step 5: Transpiration 🌱**\nPlants absorb this water through their roots and release it back into the air as water vapor through a process called transpiration.\n\nAnd then... **THE WATER CYCLE REPEATS ITSELF**! 🔄\n\nThis incredible journey of water is essential for life on Earth. Water evaporates, condenses, precipitates, runs off, infiltrates, and gets transpired - all connected in this never-ending cycle! 💪"
