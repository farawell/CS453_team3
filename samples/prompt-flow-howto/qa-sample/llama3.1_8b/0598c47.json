  "output": "**The Earth's Shaky Secrets ðŸŒŽ**\n\nEarthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates in the Earth's lithosphere (the outermost solid layer). These plates can move suddenly, causing stress to build up. When this stress is released, it creates seismic waves that we feel as an earthquake! ðŸ’¥\n\nSome possible triggers for earthquakes include:\n\n* **Plate Tectonics**: The movement of tectonic plates against each other, creating friction and releasing pent-up energy.\n* **Volcanic Activity**: The buildup and release of magma from volcanoes can also cause earthquakes.\n* **Human Activities**: Human activities like injection of fluids (e.g., fracking) or mining can alter the stress on faults and trigger earthquakes.\n\nBut don't worry! Most earthquakes are relatively small, and scientists work hard to monitor and predict seismic activity. ðŸŒŠ"
