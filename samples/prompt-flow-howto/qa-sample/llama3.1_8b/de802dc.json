  "output": "**Evolution: A Brief Overview** 🐠🔬\n\nEvolution is the scientifically supported theory that all living organisms have developed from a common ancestor through **natural selection**, genetic variation, and other mechanisms over millions of years. This fundamental concept in biology explains how species change and adapt to their environment.\n\nThink of it like this: imagine a tree with many branches (species) growing out of a single trunk (common ancestor). As time passes, the branches grow, split, and evolve into new forms, shaped by factors such as:\n\n* **Adaptation**: Developing traits that help individuals survive and reproduce in their environment.\n* **Variation**: Genetic differences among individuals within a population.\n* **Heritability**: Traits are passed down from parents to offspring.\n\nEvolution is not just about humans; it's also the story of all living things, from bacteria to plants and animals! 🌎"
