  "output": "🌴 Ah, the beautiful flamingo! 🦅\n\nFlamingos get their distinctive pink feathers from carotenoid pigments, specifically astaxanthin and canthaxanthin, which they obtain by eating algae, brine shrimp, and small crustaceans. These tiny organisms contain these pigments, and when the flamingos ingest them, the pigments are absorbed into their liver, then deposited into their fatty tissues and finally, into their feathers! 💁‍♀️\n\nThe more carotenoid-rich food they eat, the brighter pink their feathers become. So, in essence, a flamingo's rosy hue is a testament to its vibrant diet 🌿👍!"
