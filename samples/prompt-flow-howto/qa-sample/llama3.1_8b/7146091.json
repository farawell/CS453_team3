The theory consists of two main parts: **Special Relativity** (1905) and **General Relativity** (1915).\n\n### Special Relativity üöÄ\nIn Special Relativity, Einstein challenged the long-held notion of absolute time and space. He proposed that:\n\n* **Time dilation**: Time is relative, and its measurement depends on the observer's frame of reference.\n* **Length contraction**: Objects appear shorter to an observer in motion relative to the object.\n* **Relativity of simultaneity**: Two events that are simultaneous for one observer may not be simultaneous for another observer in a different state of motion.\n\n### General Relativity üåê\nIn General Relativity, Einstein built upon Special Relativity and introduced the concept of gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. He showed that:\n\n* **Gravity is not a force**: It's an inherent property of spacetime, which responds to mass and energy.\n* **Spacetime is curved**: The presence of massive objects warps spacetime, leading to gravitational fields.\n\n**Key Implications** ü§î\n\n1. **Equivalence principle**: All observers, regardless of their state of motion or position in a gravitational field, will measure the same laws of physics.\n2. **Speed of light is constant**: The speed of light remains the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion.\n\nThe Theory of Relativity has had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe, from the smallest subatomic particles to the vast expanse of cosmic scales. üí´"
