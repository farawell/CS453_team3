  "output": "No, dolphins aren't actually fish 🐬! They're mammals, just like us humans! 😊 While they live in the water and have some fish-like features, they breathe air, give birth to live young (like all mammals), and produce milk to feed their babies. So, technically, dolphins are cetaceans - a group of marine mammals that includes whales and porpoises too! 🐳"
