  "output": "**Quantum Mechanics 101 🤔**\n\nQuantum mechanics is a branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at an atomic and subatomic level. It's a mind-bending world where particles can be in multiple places at once, and observing them changes their behavior! 🌐\n\nIn simple terms, quantum mechanics is what happens when we get to the really small scale (think atoms and electrons). At this level, the rules of classical physics don't apply, and weird, probabilistic stuff starts to happen. It's like a whole different universe down there! 🔮"
