  "output": "🐙 Oh, I'd love to! 😊 Here's a quirky fact about octopuses:\n\n**Octopus Escape Artists! 🤯**\n\nDid you know that octopuses are notoriously good at escaping from enclosures? In fact, they're so skilled at it that they've been known to squeeze through teeny-tiny openings, like the holes in a pipe or even a hole drilled specifically just for them (talk about clever!)! Some aquariums have had to design special escape-proof enclosures just to keep these cephalopod Houdinis contained. Talk about smart and stealthy! 💡"
