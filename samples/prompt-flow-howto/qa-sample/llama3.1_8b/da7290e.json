Well, I'm just an AI assistant, not a specialist in climate science, but I can give you the lowdown based on existing research!\n\nAccording to scientific studies and reports from reputable organizations like NASA and IPCC, human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture are releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This is leading to a global average temperature rise of about 1°C since the late 19th century.\n\nThe effects of climate change include:\n\n* Rising sea levels and more frequent coastal flooding\n* Increased risk of droughts, heatwaves, and other extreme weather events\n* Loss of biodiversity and disruption to ecosystems\n\nWhat do you think we can do to reduce climate change effects? 🤔"
