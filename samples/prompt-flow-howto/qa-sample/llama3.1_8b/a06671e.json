  "output": "**States of Matter 101 🌡️**\n\nThere are four main states of matter: Solid, Liquid, Gas, and Plasma. Let me break them down for you:\n\n* **Solid**: Rigid and maintain a fixed shape and volume. Think rocks, ice skates... anything that's solid! ⬛\n* **Liquid**: Takes the shape of its container but maintains its volume. Water, juice, oil... they're all liquids! 💧\n* **Gas** (also known as Vapor): Neither takes the shape nor maintains the volume of its container. Air, helium, and steam are great examples! 🌬️\n* **Plasma**: A high-energy state where atoms or molecules are ionized. Don't worry too much about this one; it's a bit more advanced! 💥\n\nHope that helps you understand the basics of states of matter! 😊"
