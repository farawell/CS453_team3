  "output": "ðŸ¤” The human digestive system is like a wonderful, complex machine that breaks down food into nutrients our body can use! ðŸŒ® Here's a brief rundown:\n\n**Step 1: Mouth**\nFood enters our mouth where teeth chomp it into smaller pieces and saliva (with enzymes) starts to break down carbs.\n\n**Step 2: Esophagus**\nSwallowed food passes through the esophagus, a muscle-lined tube, into the...\n\n**Step 3: Stomach**\nThe stomach is like a big mixing bowl that churns and churns food with acidic digestive juices for about an hour. The stomach lining also protects itself from these harsh chemicals ðŸ˜….\n\n**Step 4: Small Intestine**\nNow we get to the good stuff! Pancreatic juice (rich in enzymes) and bile from the liver help break down proteins, carbs, and fats into tiny nutrients that can be absorbed by our body.\n\n**Step 5: Large Intestine (Colon)**\nThe remaining waste goes into the colon where water is absorbed, and what's left becomes feces. The colon also houses a community of good bacteria that helps us digest food and stay healthy ðŸŒ¿\n\nThat's the basic process! Of course, there are many details and intricacies to the human digestive system, but this should give you a general idea ðŸ˜Š."
