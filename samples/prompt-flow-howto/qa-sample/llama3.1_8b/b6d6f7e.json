  "output": "**Gravity 101 ðŸŒŽ**\n\nGravity is a fundamental force of nature that's always at play, but often gets overlooked in our daily lives! ðŸ˜Š It's the reason why you don't float off into space when you're standing on Earth (or any other massive object).\n\nIn short, **gravity** is the attraction between two objects with mass. The more massive the objects, and the closer they are to each other, the stronger the gravitational pull.\n\nThink of it like this: if you've ever dropped something, like a ball or a pen, and it falls towards the ground, that's gravity in action! ðŸ’ª The Earth is pulling on the object with its mass, keeping it grounded (pun intended).\n\nGravity is what keeps our feet on the ground, what makes objects fall, and even what holds planets together. It's an incredible force that shapes our universe, and we're still learning more about its secrets.\n\nSo, to sum it up: **gravity** is a universal force that attracts massive objects towards each other, keeping us all connected! ðŸŒŸ"
