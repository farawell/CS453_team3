  "output": " The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, is the continuous process through which water moves between the Earth's atmosphere, land surface, and bodies of water like oceans, lakes, and rivers. It involves various stages including evaporation, condensation, precipitation, collection, and infiltration back into the ground. Here‚Äôs a simple breakdown:\n\n1. **Evaporation**: Water from Earth's surfaces (land, ocean, ice) absorbs heat energy from the sun and turns directly into water vapor. This is the main way water enters the atmosphere.\n2. **Condensation**: As water vapor cools in the atmosphere, it forms tiny droplets around particles like dust or smoke, creating clouds.\n3. **Precipitation**: When cloud droplets combine and become too heavy to remain suspended in the air, they fall back to Earth as rain (or snow, sleet, hail) depending on atmospheric conditions.\n4. **Collection**: This precipitation can either collect directly into rivers, lakes, or oceans, or it can infiltrate into the ground, becoming groundwater.\n5. **Infiltration and Collection**: Groundwater eventually seeps back to the surface through a process called percolation or rises as springs.\n6. **Transpiration**: Plants also contribute to the water cycle by absorbing water through their roots and releasing it into the atmosphere through small openings on leaves called stomata, contributing to local humidity and regional precipitation patterns.\n\nThis continuous cycle is essential for sustaining life on Earth, providing fresh water, regulating temperatures, and creating diverse ecosystems that support all kinds of flora and fauna. üåêüíß"
