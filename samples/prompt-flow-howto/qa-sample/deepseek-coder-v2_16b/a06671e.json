  "output": " The three common states of matter are **solid**, **liquid**, and **gas**. Each state has unique properties and characteristics, which can be influenced by factors such as temperature and pressure. Here's a brief overview:\n\n- **Solid**: A solid has a fixed shape and volume. Its particles are tightly packed together and held in place by strong intermolecular forces. Solids have a definite structure and maintain their shape regardless of the container they are in. Examples include ice, wood, and metal.\n\n- **Liquid**: A liquid takes the shape of its container but has a fixed volume. Its particles are close together but can move past each other, allowing liquids to flow. The intermolecular forces in liquids are not as strong as those in solids, which is why liquids can flow. Examples include water, oil, and milk.\n\n- **Gas**: A gas does not have a fixed shape or volume; it expands to fill its container. Its particles are far apart and move rapidly, colliding with each other and the walls of the container. Gas particles can be compressed because there is a lot of empty space between them. Examples include air, helium, and hydrogen.\n\nUnderstanding these states of matter helps explain many everyday observations and phenomena, such as why objects float in water or why some materials expand when heated. üß™üå°Ô∏è"
