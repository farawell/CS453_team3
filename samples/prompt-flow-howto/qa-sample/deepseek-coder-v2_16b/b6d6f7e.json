  "output": " Hey there! 🌍 Gravitation, commonly known as gravity, is the natural force that attracts two bodies with mass towards each other. It's what keeps us grounded and the moon in orbit around Earth. Imagine if you could throw a ball straight up — without gravity, it would keep going forever! But thanks to gravity, it falls back down. Pretty neat, right?"
