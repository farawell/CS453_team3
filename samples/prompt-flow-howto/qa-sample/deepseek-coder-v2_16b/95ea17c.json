  "input": "Why are flamingos pink?",
  "output": " Flamingos get their distinctive pink color from the pigments in their diet! These colorful birds feed on tiny shrimp-like creatures called crustaceans, which contain beta carotene â€“ a pigment that gives these animals their vibrant hues. When flamingos digest these crustaceans, the beta carotene is converted into various other compounds, resulting in the pink color we know and love. ðŸŒŸðŸ¦©"
