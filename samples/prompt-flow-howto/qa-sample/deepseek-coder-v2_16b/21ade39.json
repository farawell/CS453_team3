  "output": " The Sun is actually not a planet; it's a star! ðŸŒž Stars are massive, hot balls of gas that produce light and heat through nuclear fusion reactions in their cores. Planets, on the other hand, are smaller bodies that orbit stars and do not have their own light or significant atmosphere like Earth does. So, while we often think of planets as being out there in space, the Sun is much closer to us and is a star at the center of our solar system."
