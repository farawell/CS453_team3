  "output": " Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose (sugar). This process involves two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions.\n\n1. **Light-Dependent Reactions**: During this stage, light energy is absorbed by pigments called chlorophylls located in structures called thylakoids within chloroplasts. These pigments capture specific wavelengths of light that are used to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). Additionally, during this stage, water molecules are split, releasing oxygen gas as a byproduct‚Äîthis is why photosynthesis is often referred to as \"oxygenic\" because it produces oxygen.\n\n2. **Light-Independent Reactions**: In the second stage, also known as the Calvin cycle or carbon fixation, ATP and NADPH generated during the light-dependent reactions are used to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into glucose (C6H12O6). This process does not require light but relies on the energy stored in ATP and NADPH.\n\nOverall, photosynthesis is a complex biochemical process that harnesses sunlight to produce essential nutrients like glucose for plants and other organisms that consume them. üåûüçÉ"
