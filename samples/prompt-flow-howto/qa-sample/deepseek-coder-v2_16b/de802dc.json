  "output": " Hey there! ðŸŒ± Evolution is the process by which organisms change over time through small, gradual changes in their genetic makeup (DNA). These changes accumulate and can lead to the appearance of new traits or characteristics that help species adapt to their environment. It's like a \"survival of the fittest\" story, where advantageous traits are passed on to future generations, making life forms more fit for their specific environments."
