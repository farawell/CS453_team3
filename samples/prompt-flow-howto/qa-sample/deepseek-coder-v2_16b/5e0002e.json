  "output": " The human digestive system is an intricate network of organs responsible for breaking down food into nutrients that the body can absorb and use for energy. Hereâ€™s a simplified overview of its main functions:\n\n1. **Ingestion**: This is the process of taking in food, which usually starts with eating. \n2. **Digestion**: The breakdown of food into smaller components through mechanical and chemical processes. \n3. **Absorption**: Nutrients from digested food are absorbed into the bloodstream via the walls of the small intestine. \n4. **Elimination**: Undigested materials pass into the large intestine, where water is absorbed, forming solid waste that is eventually eliminated as stool. \n\nItâ€™s fascinating how our bodies can turn what we eat into something we can use to keep going! ðŸ˜Š"
