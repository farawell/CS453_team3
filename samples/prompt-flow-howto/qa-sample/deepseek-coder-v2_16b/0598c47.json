  "input": "What causes earthquakes?",
  "output": " Earthquakes are primarily caused by the sudden release of built-up energy in the Earth's crust, which results from movements along geological faults or discontinuities. These movements can be due to the movement of tectonic plates, and they often occur as a result of **plate boundaries**, where one plate moves over another, causing stress along their interface. This stress builds up over time until it becomes too great for the rock material between the plates to withstand, resulting in an earthquake.\n\nRemember, earthquakes are a natural phenomenon, and while scientists can predict some aspects, they cannot accurately forecast when and where individual quakes will occur with certainty."
