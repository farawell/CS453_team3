  "output": " The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, consists of two main pillars: **Special Relativity** and **General Relativity**.\n\n1. **Special Relativity (1905)**:\n   - This theory focuses on objects moving at constant speeds, particularly those close to the speed of light.\n   - It introduces two fundamental concepts:\n     - **Time dilation**: Time passes slower for an object in motion relative to a stationary observer.\n     - **Length contraction**: Objects in motion appear shorter to an observer than they do to someone who is at rest relative to the object.\n   - The theory also presents the famous equation \\( E = mc^2 \\), which relates energy (E) to mass (m) and the speed of light (c). This formula states that even a small amount of mass can be converted into a large amount of energy, highlighting the fundamental relationship between mass and energy.\n\n2. **General Relativity (1915)**:\n   - General Relativity extends Special Relativity to include gravity.\n   - According to this theory, gravity is not a force but rather a curvature in spacetime caused by mass or energy. Massive objects cause the fabric of space-time to curve, and any other object moving along a curved path follows this curvature. This explains phenomena such as planetary orbits and the bending of light around massive objects.\n   - The field equations of General Relativity are:\n     \\[ G_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{8\\pi G}{c^4} T_{\\mu\\nu} \\]\n     Here, \\( G_{\\mu\\nu} \\) is the Einstein tensor representing spacetime curvature, and \\( T_{\\mu\\nu} \\) is the stress-energy tensor representing matter distribution.\n\nThe theory of relativity has profound implications for our understanding of space, time, and gravity, laying the foundation for modern physics and astronomy."
