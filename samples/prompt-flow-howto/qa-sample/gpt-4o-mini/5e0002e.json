  "output": "The human digestive system is a complex network that breaks down food, absorbs nutrients, and eliminates waste. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\n\n1. **Mouth**: Digestion begins here. Chewing breaks food into smaller pieces, and saliva (containing enzymes) starts to break down carbohydrates.\n\n2. **Esophagus**: The food travels down this muscular tube through a process called peristalsis, which is a series of wave-like muscle contractions.\n\n3. **Stomach**: Food is mixed with gastric juices, which include hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes. This acidic environment helps break down proteins and kill harmful bacteria.\n\n4. **Small Intestine**: This is where most nutrient absorption occurs. Digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver help further digest food. The walls of the small intestine absorb nutrients into the bloodstream.\n\n5. **Large Intestine**: Remaining waste products enter here. Water and electrolytes are absorbed, and the leftover material is formed into stool.\n\n6. **Rectum and Anus**: Finally, waste is stored in the rectum until itâ€™s expelled through the anus during a bowel movement. ðŸš½\n\nAnd voilÃ ! That's how the human digestive system works! If you have more questions, feel free to ask! ðŸŒŸ"
