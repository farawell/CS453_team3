  "output": "The states of matter are the distinct forms that different phases of matter take on. The most commonly recognized states include:\n\n1. **Solid**: Has a fixed shape and volume. The particles are closely packed together and vibrate in place.\n   \n2. **Liquid**: Has a definite volume but takes the shape of its container. The particles are close together but can move past each other.\n   \n3. **Gas**: Has neither a fixed shape nor a fixed volume. The particles are far apart and move freely.\n\n4. **Plasma**: A superheated state where electrons are stripped from atoms, resulting in a mixture of charged particles. Found in stars, including the sun! ðŸŒŸ\n\n5. **Bose-Einstein Condensate**: A state of matter formed at temperatures close to absolute zero, where particles occupy the same space and quantum state.\n\n6. **Fermionic Condensate**: Similar to Bose-Einstein condensate, but formed with fermions instead of bosons, also at very low temperatures.\n\nEach state has unique properties based on the arrangement and energy of its particles! If you have any further questions, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š"
