  "output": "Absolutely! Did you know that octopuses have three hearts? ❤️💙💚 Two of the hearts pump blood to the gills, where it picks up oxygen, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. And when they swim, the heart that delivers blood to the body actually stops, which is why they prefer to crawl rather than swim! Isn’t that fascinating? 🐙✨"
