  "output": "Sure! The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, is a continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere. Here's a breakdown of its main processes:\n\n1. **Evaporation** ☀️: Water from oceans, rivers, and lakes turns into vapor due to the sun's heat.\n\n2. **Transpiration** 🌱: Plants release water vapor into the air from their leaves.\n\n3. **Condensation** ☁️: Water vapor cools and forms tiny droplets, creating clouds.\n\n4. **Precipitation** 🌧️: Water falls back to Earth in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n\n5. **Collection** 🌊: Water collects in bodies like rivers, lakes, and oceans, where it can begin the cycle again.\n\nThis cycle is essential for maintaining the environment and supporting life on Earth! 💧"
