  "output": "Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that attracts two bodies with mass toward each other. It's what keeps us grounded on Earth, makes objects fall when dropped, and governs the motion of planets, stars, and galaxies in space. ðŸŒŒ\n\nIn simple terms, itâ€™s the reason why when you jump, you come back down! The more massive an object, the stronger its gravitational pull. For instance, the Earth has a much stronger gravitational pull than a small ball. \n\nIs there anything specific about gravity youâ€™d like to know more about? ðŸ˜Š"
