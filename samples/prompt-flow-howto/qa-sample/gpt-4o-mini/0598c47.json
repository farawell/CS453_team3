  "output": "Earthquakes are primarily caused by the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth's surface. Here are some key factors:\n\n1. **Tectonic Plate Movements**: The Earth's crust is divided into large plates that float on the semi-fluid mantle beneath. When these plates move, they can collide, pull apart, or slide past each other, causing stress that leads to earthquakes.\n\n2. **Fault Lines**: Most earthquakes occur along faults, which are fractures in the Earth's crust. When stress builds up along these faults and exceeds the strength of the rocks, it results in a sudden release of energy, generating seismic waves.\n\n3. **Volcanic Activity**: Earthquakes can also occur in volcanic regions due to the movement of magma, which can create pressure and lead to seismic activity.\n\n4. **Human Activities**: Activities like mining, reservoir-induced seismicity (due to large reservoirs), and geothermal energy extraction can also induce earthquakes.\n\n5. **Natural Factors**: Other natural factors include landslides, rockfalls, or the collapse of underground caves.\n\nFeel free to ask if you want to know more about any specific aspect! üåç‚ú®"
