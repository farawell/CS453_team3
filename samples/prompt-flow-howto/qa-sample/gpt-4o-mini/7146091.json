  "output": "The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century, consists of two main parts: **Special Relativity** and **General Relativity**.\n\n### Special Relativity (1905)\n- **Key Concepts**: Time dilation, length contraction, and the equivalence of mass and energy (E=mcÂ²).\n- **Principle**: The laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, and the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless of their motion.\n\n### General Relativity (1915)\n- **Key Concepts**: Gravity as a curvature of spacetime rather than a force.\n- **Principle**: Massive objects like planets and stars warp the fabric of spacetime, causing objects to follow curved paths. This explains phenomena such as the bending of light around massive bodies.\n\n### Impact\nEinstein's theories revolutionized our understanding of time, space, and gravity, leading to advancements in various fields, including astrophysics and cosmology. ðŸŒŒ\n\nIf you have any specific questions about the theory, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š"
