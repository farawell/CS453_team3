  "output": "Flamingos are pink primarily due to their diet! ðŸ¦© They consume a lot of carotenoid-rich foods, like algae and shrimp, which contain pigments that give them their distinctive color. The more carotenoids they ingest, the pinker they become! \n\nInterestingly, when flamingos are born, they are actually gray and develop their pink hue over time as they eat these pigment-rich foods. ðŸŒˆ"
