  "output": "Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. Here are some key points:\n\n- **Wave-Particle Duality**: Particles can exhibit properties of both waves and particles.\n- **Uncertainty Principle**: You cannot simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty.\n- **Superposition**: Particles can exist in multiple states at the same time until measured.\n- **Entanglement**: Particles can be interconnected in such a way that the state of one instantly influences the state of another, no matter the distance.\n\nQuantum mechanics has led to advancements in technology, such as semiconductors and quantum computing. ðŸŒŒâœ¨ If you have more questions or need specifics, feel free to ask!"
