Did you know that a day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus? ðŸŒŒ\n\nVenus takes about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but only about 225 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun. So, if you were standing on Venus, you'd experience a single day stretching longer than its year! Isn't that fascinating? ðŸŒŸ"
