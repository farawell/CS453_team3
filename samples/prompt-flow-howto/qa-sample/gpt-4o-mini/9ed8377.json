  "input": "Are dolphins fish?",
  "output": "No, dolphins are not fish! 🐬 They are mammals, which means they breathe air, give live birth, and nurse their young with milk. Unlike fish, dolphins have lungs instead of gills and need to surface for air. So, while they live in the water, they're more closely related to humans than to fish! 🌊"
