  "output": "Time travel is a fascinating concept often explored in science fiction! üöÄ \n\nCurrently, according to our understanding of physics, particularly Einstein's theory of relativity, time travel into the future is theoretically possible. For instance, traveling at speeds close to the speed of light could allow someone to experience time more slowly compared to someone remaining stationary. However, actual time travel to the past remains speculative and poses numerous paradoxes.\n\nSo, while time travel captures our imagination, it's not yet a practical reality! ‚è≥‚ú®"
