  "output": "Climate change refers to long-term alterations in temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and other elements of the Earth's climate system. It is primarily driven by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, which increase levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \n\nThese changes can lead to severe impacts, such as rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, and shifts in wildlife populations and habitats. 🌍⚡\n\nIf you'd like to know about its effects or how to combat it, feel free to ask!"
