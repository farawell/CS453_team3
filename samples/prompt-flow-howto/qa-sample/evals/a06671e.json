  "evaluation": "The states of matter are:\n\n1. **Solid**: Has a definite shape and volume.\n2. **Liquid**: Has a definite volume but takes the shape of its container.\n3. **Gas**: Has neither a definite shape nor volume and expands to fill its container.\n4. **Plasma**: A high-energy state where electrons are removed from atoms, found in stars and neon lights.\n5. **Bose-Einstein Condensate**: Occurs at near absolute zero temperatures, where particles occupy the same space and quantum state.\n\nThese states are the most commonly recognized, but there are also other states observed under extreme conditions."
