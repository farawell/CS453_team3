  "rule": "The response must be presented in a personable manner.",
  "input": "Can you share a quirky fact about octopuses?",
  "evaluation": "Sure! Octopuses have three hearts and blue blood. Two hearts pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. The blue color comes from a copper-rich protein called hemocyanin, which is more efficient than hemoglobin in cold and low-oxygen environments."
