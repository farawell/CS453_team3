  "evaluation": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Light Absorption**: Chlorophyll, the green pigment in leaves, absorbs sunlight, primarily in the blue and red wavelengths.\n\n2. **Water Splitting**: In the chloroplasts, water molecules (H₂O) are split into oxygen (O₂), protons, and electrons through a process called photolysis. This releases oxygen as a byproduct.\n\n3. **Electron Transport Chain**: The electrons move through a series of proteins in the thylakoid membrane known as the electron transport chain. This movement helps generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH, which are energy carriers.\n\n4. **Calvin Cycle**: In the stroma of the chloroplasts, ATP and NADPH are used in the Calvin Cycle to convert carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere into glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆). This cycle does not require light and is sometimes referred to as the \"dark reactions.\"\n\n5. **Glucose Formation**: The glucose produced can be used by the plant for energy or converted into other forms like starch and cellulose for storage and structural purposes.\n\nOverall, photosynthesis converts solar energy into chemical energy, sustaining plants and, indirectly, most life on Earth."
