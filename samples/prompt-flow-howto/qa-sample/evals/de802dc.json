  "input": "What is evolution?",
  "evaluation": "Evolution is the process through which species of organisms change over time through variations in their genetic makeup. These changes can occur due to mutations, natural selection, gene flow, and genetic drift. Over many generations, these changes can lead to the development of new species. The theory of evolution, primarily associated with Charles Darwin, explains how life diversifies and adapts to different environments."
