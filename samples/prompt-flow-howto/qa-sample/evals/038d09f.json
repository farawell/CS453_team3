  "input": "What is quantum mechanics?",
  "evaluation": "Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It provides a mathematical framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of systems at these small scales, where classical mechanics no longer applies.\n\nKey concepts in quantum mechanics include:\n\n1. **Wave-Particle Duality**: Particles such as electrons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.\n\n2. **Quantization**: Energy levels in a quantum system are discrete, not continuous.\n\n3. **Uncertainty Principle**: Formulated by Heisenberg, it states that certain pairs of properties, like position and momentum, cannot both be precisely measured at the same time.\n\n4. **Superposition**: Particles can exist in multiple states or locations simultaneously until measured.\n\n5. **Entanglement**: Particles can become entangled, meaning the state of one particle instantly influences the state of another, regardless of distance.\n\nQuantum mechanics has been incredibly successful in explaining phenomena at the atomic scale and forms the basis for many modern technologies, such as semiconductors and lasers."
