  "rule": "The response must be presented in a formal manner.",
  "inverse": true,
  "input": "Describe the theory of relativity.",
  "evaluation": "The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, consists of two main parts: special relativity and general relativity.\n\n### Special Relativity (1905)\n- **Principle of Relativity**: The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another.\n- **Speed of Light**: The speed of light in a vacuum is constant and is not affected by the motion of the light source or observer.\n- **Time Dilation**: Time appears to pass more slowly for objects moving at high speeds compared to those at rest.\n- **Length Contraction**: Objects appear shorter in the direction of motion as they approach the speed of light.\n- **Mass-Energy Equivalence**: Expressed by the famous equation \\(E=mc^2\\), indicating that mass and energy are interchangeable.\n\n### General Relativity (1915)\n- **Gravitational Field**: Replaces the concept of gravitational force with the curvature of spacetime caused by mass.\n- **Spacetime**: A four-dimensional continuum that combines the three dimensions of space with time.\n- **Geodesics**: Objects move along paths called geodesics, which are the shortest paths through curved spacetime.\n- **Gravitational Time Dilation**: Time runs slower in stronger gravitational fields.\n- **Predictions**: General relativity predicts phenomena such as the bending of light around massive objects (gravitational lensing), the existence of black holes, and the expansion of the universe.\n\nThese theories have been confirmed by numerous experiments and observations, profoundly influencing our understanding of space, time, and gravity."
