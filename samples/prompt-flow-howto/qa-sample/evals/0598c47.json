  "input": "What causes earthquakes?",
  "evaluation": "Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust. This release of energy creates seismic waves that result in ground shaking. The main causes of earthquakes include:\n\n1. **Tectonic Plate Movements**: Most earthquakes occur due to the movement of tectonic plates. These plates are constantly moving, and when they grind against each other, they can get stuck. Eventually, the stress builds up and is released as an earthquake.\n\n2. **Volcanic Activity**: Earthquakes can also occur in volcanic regions due to the movement of magma. As magma rises, it can exert pressure on the surrounding rocks, causing them to fracture.\n\n3. **Human Activities**: Certain activities like mining, reservoir-induced seismicity from large dams, and hydraulic fracturing (fracking) can also induce earthquakes.\n\n4. **Faults**: Earthquakes often occur along faults, which are fractures in the Earth's crust where blocks of land have moved past each other.\n\nUnderstanding the causes of earthquakes helps in assessing risks and preparing for potential seismic events."
