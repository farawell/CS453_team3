  "inverse": true,
  "input": "What do you think about climate change?",
  "evaluation": "Climate change is a significant global issue that involves long-term changes in temperature and weather patterns. These changes are largely driven by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, which increases greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It poses serious risks to natural and human systems, including rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and biodiversity loss. Addressing climate change requires coordinated global efforts to reduce emissions, transition to renewable energy, and adapt to changes."
