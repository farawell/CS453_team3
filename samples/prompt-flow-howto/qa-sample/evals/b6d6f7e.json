  "input": "What is gravity?",
  "evaluation": "Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that attracts two bodies with mass toward each other. It is what makes objects fall to the ground and keeps planets in orbit around stars. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and influences their motion. The strength of gravitational attraction between two objects depends on their masses and the distance between them, as described by Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation. Albert Einstein later expanded on this with his theory of general relativity, which explains gravity as the curvature of spacetime around massive objects."
