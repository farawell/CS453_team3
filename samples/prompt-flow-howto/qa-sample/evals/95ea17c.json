  "input": "Why are flamingos pink?",
  "evaluation": "Flamingos are pink because of the pigments in the food they eat. Their diet mainly consists of algae, crustaceans, and plankton, which contain carotenoids. These pigments are broken down in the flamingos' digestive system and then absorbed, giving their feathers that distinctive pink color."
