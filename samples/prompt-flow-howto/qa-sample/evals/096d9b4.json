  "evaluation": "The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, describes how water moves through the Earth's atmosphere, surface, and below ground. It consists of several key processes:\n\n1. **Evaporation**: Water from oceans, rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water turns into vapor due to the sunâ€™s heat. Plants also release water vapor through a process called transpiration.\n\n2. **Condensation**: The water vapor rises into the atmosphere and cools, turning back into liquid droplets, forming clouds.\n\n3. **Precipitation**: When the clouds become heavy with water droplets, they fall back to the Earth's surface as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n\n4. **Collection**: The precipitation collects in bodies of water like lakes, rivers, and oceans. Some of it infiltrates the ground, replenishing groundwater supplies.\n\n5. **Runoff**: Some water flows over the land, returning to bodies of water, and the cycle begins again.\n\nThis continuous movement of water is crucial for maintaining the balance of ecosystems and supporting life on Earth."
