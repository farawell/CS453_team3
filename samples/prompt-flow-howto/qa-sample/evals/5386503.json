  "input": "Is time travel possible?",
  "evaluation": "As of now, time travel as often depicted in science fiction—moving backward or forward through time at will—remains theoretical. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, time is relative and can be affected by speed and gravity. For example, time moves slower for objects in strong gravitational fields or at high speeds compared to those in weaker fields or at rest, a phenomenon known as time dilation.\n\nSome theoretical concepts, like wormholes and the concept of closed time-like curves, suggest possible means of time travel, but these ideas are speculative and not practically achievable with our current technology and understanding of physics."
