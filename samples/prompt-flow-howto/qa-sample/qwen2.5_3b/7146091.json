  "output": "The Theory of Relativity, primarily developed by Albert Einstein, consists of two complementary theories: Special Relativity and General Relativity.\n\n### 1. **Special Relativity**\n- **Postulates**:\n  - The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another (Principle of Relativity).\n  - The speed of light in a vacuum is constant, independent of the motion of the light source or observer.\n  \n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - Time and space are not absolute but are interwoven into a single continuum known as spacetime. Events that are simultaneous for one observer can be non-simultaneous for another observer moving relative to the first.\n  - Mass and energy are equivalent, expressed by the equation \\( E = mc^2 \\), where \\( m \\) is mass and \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\n### 2. **General Relativity**\n- **Postulates**:\n  - Gravity can be understood as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.\n  \n- **Key Concepts**:\n  - Massive objects cause a distortion in spacetime, which we perceive as gravity. This theory describes how gravity affects the motion of objects and the geometry of space itself.\n  - Spacetime is not flat but curved based on the amount of matter and energy present within it.\n\nThese theories have profound implications for our understanding of physics, particularly at very high speeds or in strong gravitational fields like near black holes."
