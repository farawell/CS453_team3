  "output": "The human digestive system is a complex process that starts in the mouth and continues through the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and ends with the elimination of waste. Here’s a brief overview:\n\n1️⃣ **Mouth**: Food enters the mouth where it's broken down by chewing into smaller pieces called bolus.\n2️⃣ **Esophagus**: The esophagus acts like a tube that moves the food to the stomach via muscle contractions.\n3️⃣ **Stomach**: Stomach acids and enzymes break down the food further. This also mixes with bile from the liver and gallbladder, which helps digest fats.\n4️⃣ **Small Intestine**: The small intestine is where most of nutrient absorption happens through tiny finger-like structures called villi. Here, pancreatic juice and other digestive substances continue breaking down food.\n5️⃣ **Large Intestine (Colon)**: Water is absorbed here, forming solid waste. It also absorbs vitamins produced by gut bacteria.\n6️⃣ **Elimination**: Waste travels through the rectum to be expelled from the body via the anus.\n\nThis process varies slightly between individuals and can become compromised in conditions like indigestion or certain digestive disorders."
