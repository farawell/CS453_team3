  "output": "Photosynthesis is the process plants use to convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. It works like this:\n\n1. **Light Absorption**: Chlorophyll in leaves absorbs sunlight.\n2. **Water Splitting (Photolysis)**: The absorbed light splits water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen ions.\n3. **Carbon Dioxide Fixation**: Hydrogen from the split water combines with carbon dioxide gas to form glucose.\n\nThis basic overview simplifies a complex process, but it covers the core steps!"
