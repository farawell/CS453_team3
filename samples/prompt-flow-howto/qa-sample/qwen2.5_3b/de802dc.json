  "output": "Evolution refers to the change in characteristics of living organisms over several generations. It's a fundamental concept in biology explaining how species develop and adapt through time.\n\nTo elaborate further:\n- Natural selection plays a key role, where traits that are advantageous for survival spread through populations.\n- Genetic variation provides the raw material for evolution to act upon.\n- Evolution explains why different species exist today and how they may change over long periods of time.\n\nIs there anything specific about evolution you'd like to know more about?"
