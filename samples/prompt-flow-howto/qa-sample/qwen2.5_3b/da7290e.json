  "output": "Climate change is a serious global issue with significant impacts on our environment and ecosystems. Many scientists agree that it's primarily caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels, leading to increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This raises temperatures and leads to changes in weather patterns. I believe we need urgent action including reducing emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and adopting more sustainable practices to mitigate its effects."
