  "output": "An ecosystem is a community of living and non-living things in an area, such as plants, animals, and rocks. It includes all the organisms in an area (like animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria) and their physical environment (like air, water, and soil). Ecosystems can vary greatly in size and complexity.\n\nFor example:\n- A small pond ecosystem might include fish, frogs, algae, and water.\n- A forest ecosystem includes trees, squirrels, insects, birds, mushrooms, etc., along with the soil, sunlight, air, and water that all depend on each other."
