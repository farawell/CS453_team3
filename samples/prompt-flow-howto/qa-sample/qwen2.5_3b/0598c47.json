  "output": "Earthquakes occur when energy builds up in the Earth's crust over time and suddenly releases, typically due to tectonic plate movements. This energy release creates seismic waves that we feel as shaking.\n\nMore specifically:\n- **Tectonic Plate Movement**: The Earth's outer layer is divided into several large and small pieces called tectonic plates. These plates move very slowly but over time this movement can cause pressure buildup at their boundaries.\n- **Faulting**: When two plates push against each other, the rocks on the fault line bend until they break suddenly, releasing stored energy as a seismic wave.\n\nThe combination of these factors leads to earthquakes."
