  "output": "The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, is a continuous process by which water circulates between Earth's oceans, atmosphere, and land. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation:\n\n1. **Evaporation**: Water from bodies of water (like oceans, lakes, and rivers) heats up by the sun and turns into vapor or steam.\n\n2. **Transpiration**: Plants also release water vapor through their leaves.\n\n3. **Condensation**: As moisture-laden air cools in the atmosphere, it condenses to form clouds.\n\n4. **Precipitation**: Water falls from clouds as rain, snow, sleet, or hail depending on conditions.\n\n5. **Collection**: The collected water (as precipitation) feeds rivers, lakes, and eventually ends up back into oceans and seas.\n\nThis cycle is crucial for sustaining life on Earth."
