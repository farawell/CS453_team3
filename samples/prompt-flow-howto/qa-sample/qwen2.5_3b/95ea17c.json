  "output": "Flamingos get their pink color from the food they eat, which contains carotenoid pigments! In nature, they primarily feed on algae and tiny crustaceans called brine shrimp (which gives them a lovely blue-gray appearance). When these foods contain high levels of beta-carotene, it turns their feathers a vibrant pink. Pink flamingos are usually more vivid in color than the gray ones that get less carotenoid-rich food! üê¶‚ú®"
