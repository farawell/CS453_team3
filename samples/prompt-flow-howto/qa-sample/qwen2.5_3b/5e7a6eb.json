  "output": "The Periodic Table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements, organized by atomic number (number of protons in an atom's nucleus), electron configuration, and sometimes other properties like electronegativity or melting point. It was first created by Dmitri Mendeleev and later filled out by others.\n\nKey features include:\n- **Rows:** These are called \"periods.\" They increase from top to bottom with atomic number.\n- **Columns:** These are called \"groups,\" also known as \"families\" of elements that share similar properties.  \n  - Example: Group 1 (Alkali Metals) includes lithium, sodium, potassium, etc., all having a +1 charge in compounds.\n- The table divides naturally into several blocks based on the type of subshell occupied by the outermost electrons:\n  - s-block (Group 1 and 2)\n  - p-block\n  - d-block (excluding Hg which fills s and f orbitals instead)\n  - f-block (Lanthanides and Actinides)\n\nPeriodic trends include changes in atomic radius, ionization energy, electron affinity, melting point, etc., as you move left to right across a period or top to bottom within a group.\n\nIt's a fundamental organizing tool for studying chemistry!"
