  "output": "Sure thing! The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, is like a big cycle where Earth's water moves from one place to another and changes its state. Here it goes:\n\n💦 **Evaporation**: The sun heats up water in oceans, lakes, rivers, and groundwater. This causes some of the water to turn into vapor (water gas) and rise into the air.\n\n🌬️ **Rising Air**: As this vapor rises, it cools and condenses, forming tiny water droplets that can't fall as rain yet because they're too small and light.\n\n💨 **Formation of Clouds**: These tiny droplets gather together to form clouds. This is where water stays in the air, waiting for a chance to come back down to Earth.\n\n☁️ → 🌧️ **Precipitation**: When conditions are right (like when it's cold or there's enough weight from other droplets), precipitation happens! This can be rain, snow, sleet, or hail. Some of this water falls directly onto the ground, while some falls into bodies of water.\n\n🌲 **Collection**: The water that falls on land either runs off (forming streams and rivers) or soaks into the ground (becoming groundwater).\n\n💦 **Evaporation Again**: And then it all starts over again! Some of the water from lakes, rivers, and oceans evaporates back into the air, ready to be a part of another cloud.\n\nAnd that's the water cycle in a nutshell! Isn't Earth's water dance fascinating? 🌍💦💨"
