  "output": "Photosynthesis is a process where plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight into energy. Here's a simple breakdown:\n\n- **Light-dependent reactions** (in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts):\n  - Light energizes electrons in chlorophyll molecules.\n  - These electrons are passed along a series of electron acceptors, releasing energy that is used to produce ATP and NADPH.\n  - Water molecules are split to replace lost electrons, releasing oxygen as a byproduct.\n\n- **Light-independent reactions** (in the stroma of chloroplasts):\n  - Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere combines with RuBP (a 5-carbon sugar) to produce an unstable 6-carbon compound.\n  - This compound is then converted into two molecules of 3-PGA, which can be used to make glucose.\n\nðŸŒ± So, sunlight + water + carbon dioxide â†’ energy (glucose) + oxygen! ðŸŒ±"
