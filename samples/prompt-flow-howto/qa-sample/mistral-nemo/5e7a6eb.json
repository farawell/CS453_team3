  "output": "The **periodic table** ðŸ”„ is like the organigram of elements â€“ it's how all the known chemical elements are organized based on their atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. Here's a simple breakdown:\n\n- There are **18 vertical columns called groups**, numbered 1-18.\n- The **7 horizontal rows are called periods**.\n- Each element has an **atomic number**, which is its unique identifier (like a driver's license for elements! ðŸ˜Š).\n- Elements in the same group have similar properties, like reactive metals on the left and nonmetals on the right.\n- The table starts with **hydrogen (H)** at the top left with an atomic number of 1, and ends with lawrencium (Lr), a newly synthesized element with an atomic number of 103.\n\nCheck out this [interactive periodic table](https://periodic.lens.org/) to explore further! ðŸŒŸ"
