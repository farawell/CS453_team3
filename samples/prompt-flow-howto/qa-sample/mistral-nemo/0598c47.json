  "output": "Earthquakes are mainly caused by sudden movement between **tectonic plates**, the large pieces of Earth's crust that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. This movement can occur suddenly due to accumulated stress, resulting in waves of energy (seismic waves) that travel through the Earth and cause vibrations that we feel as earthquakes 🌍💥"
