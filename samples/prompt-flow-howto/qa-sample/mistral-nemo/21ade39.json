  "output": "No, the ðŸŒž Sun is actually a star! It's classified as a G-type main-sequence star, located in the Milky Way galaxy.

Here's a neat fun fact for you: did you know that the gravitational pull of every planet in our solar system is only about 0.14% of what the ðŸŒž Sun exerts? Isn't space fascinating?!"
