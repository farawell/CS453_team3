  "output": "🌍 Gravity, my friend, is the force that attracts two objects towards each other! It's what keeps you on the ground and makes sure your coffee doesn't float away. In physics terms, it's the ratio of two masses times a constant (G) divided by the distance between their centers squared. Isn't science fun? 🎓🚀"
