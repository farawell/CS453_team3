  "output": "Hey there! 🌟 The states of matter are solids, liquids, and gases. Here's a quick rundown:\n\n1. **Solids** 🧱: They maintain their shape and volume.\n2. **Liquids** 💦: They take the shape of their container but maintain their volume.\n3. **Gases** ⛹️‍♂️: They don't have a definite shape or volume, they spread out in any container.\n\nPretty neat stuff! 🤓"
