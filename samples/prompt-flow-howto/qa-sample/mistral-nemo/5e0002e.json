  "output": "The human digestive system is like a superhighway for food 🚗! Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Ingestion**: You put food in your mouth (hopefully not too much at once 🍴🙅‍♂️).\n2. **Mouth/Digestive Organs**: Your saliva starts breaking down the food.\n3. **Esophagus**: Food travels here after you swallow, then moves to the stomach via peristalsis (muscle contractions) 🌊.\n4. **Stomach**: Here's where it gets churned up into a semi-liquid mixture called chyme 🍲 by stomach acids and enzymes.\n5. **Small Intestine**: Nutrients are absorbed here through tiny hairs called villi, which is like having your own personal nutrient vacuum cleaner 🧪!\n6. **Large Intestine**: Water and excess nutrients are reabsorbed, and fiber moves along to the rectum 💨.\n7. **Rectum/Anus**: The remaining waste is stored here until you... well, you know what happens next! ⏲️\n\nSo there you have it, a quick rundown of how your body turns food into energy (and waste)!"
