Here we go:**\n\n* **Special Theory of Relativity (1905):**\n\t+ Everything's relative, baby! So, if you're on a speedy journey in one direction, time will pass slower for you compared to someone sitting still.\n\t+ And guess what? Mass and energy are two sides of the same coin. E=mcÂ², fam!\n* **General Theory of Relativity (1915):**\n\t+ Gravity's not just about attraction; it's also about space-time being warped by massive objects.\n\t+ Imagine you're on a trampoline, and someone puts a heavy ball on it. It'll make a dent, right? That's what massive objects do to space-time!\n\n**Pretty wild stuff, huh? ðŸŒŒ You can read more about it [here](https://www.britannica.com/science/relativity-theory).**\n\n*Did I miss anything?*"
