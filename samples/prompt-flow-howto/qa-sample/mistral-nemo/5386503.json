  "output": "Based on our current understanding of physics, no, time travel is not possible. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, it's theoretically possible to slow down time using something called \"time dilation,\" but this only works at extreme speeds or gravitational fields, and we can't travel backwards in time. 🕰️🚫"
