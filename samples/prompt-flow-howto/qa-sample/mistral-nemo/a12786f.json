  "output": "An \"ecosystem\" is like a big, balanced community where different species interact and depend on each other and their environment 🌍🐦❤️. Here's a simple breakdown:\n\n- **Living beings**: Plants, animals, microorganisms (like bacteria and fungi)\n- **Non-living factors**: Air, water, soil, sunlight, temperature\n- **Interactions**: Food chains and webs where organisms depend on each other for food or shelter, and symbiotic relationships like mutualism and parasitism 🔗🐛🍃\n\nFor example, a rainforest ecosystem includes plants providing oxygen and homes, animals eating the plants or each other, and microorganisms breaking down dead matter. They all work together to maintain balance ⚖️.\n\nSources:\n- [National Geographic Kids: What is an Ecosystem?](https://www.natgeokids.com/za/discover/general-science/what-is-an-ecosystem/)\n- [Encyclopedia Britannica: Ecosystem](https://www.britannica.com/science/ecosystem)"
