  "output": "That's a great question!  🦩\n\nFlamingos get their rosy hue from the food they eat. 🦐 They munch on algae and shrimp that contain pigments called carotenoids. These pigments build up in their feathers, giving them that beautiful pink color. 💖  \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other curious questions! 🤔\n"
