  "output": "Earthquakes happen when tectonic plates, which are giant slabs of rock under the Earth's surface, move and grind against each other 🌎💥  Sometimes they get stuck, then suddenly slip past each other, releasing tons of energy in the form of seismic waves! That's what makes the ground shake.  \n\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions about earthquakes! 😊\n"
