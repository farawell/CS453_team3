  "output": "Hey there!  Einstein's theory of relativity is pretty mind-blowing 🤯 It basically explains how gravity works and how space and time are connected.  \n\nThere are two main parts: special relativity (deals with things moving at constant speeds) and general relativity (deals with gravity and accelerating objects). It's super complex, but it helped us understand black holes, the Big Bang, and even GPS! 🛰️🧠 \n\n\nLet me know if you want to dive deeper into a specific part – I can try my best to explain! 😊  \n"
