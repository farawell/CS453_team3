  "output": "That's a great question!  Our digestive system is pretty amazing ðŸ¤© \n\nBasically, it's a long journey food takes through our body. It starts in your mouth where you chew and mix it with saliva. Then it goes down your esophagus to your stomach where acids break it down further. Next, it moves into the small intestine where nutrients are absorbed. Finally, whatever's left goes to the large intestine where water is absorbed and waste is formed. ðŸ’©\n\nWant to learn more about a specific part of the process? ðŸ¤”  \n\n\n"
