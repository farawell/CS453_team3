  "output": "Hey there! 👋  The water cycle is pretty neat! 🌎💧 It's how water constantly moves between the Earth and the atmosphere.\n\nHere's a quick rundown:\n\n* **Evaporation:** The sun heats up water in rivers, lakes, and oceans, turning it into vapor that rises into the air.\n* **Condensation:**  As the vapor cools higher up, it turns back into tiny water droplets, forming clouds. ☁️ \n* **Precipitation:** When those droplets get too heavy, they fall back to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. 🌧️🌨️❄️\n* **Collection:** The precipitation collects in rivers, lakes, oceans, or soaks into the ground, and the cycle starts all over again! 🔄\n\n\nHope that helps! 😄  Let me know if you have any other questions! ✨"
