  "model": "llama3.2:3b",
  "actualOutput": "🐧😅 Unfortunately, the answer is no, penguins cannot fly! 🚫 They are amazing swimmers and divers, but flying is not one of their skills. Their wings have evolved to be more suited for propelling them through the water than through the air. But don't worry, they can still waddle around on land with style and charm! 😊",
