  "actualOutput": "🦅 Those iconic birds! Flamingos get their distinctive pink feathers from carotenoid pigments, specifically astaxanthin and canthaxanthin, which they obtain through their diet.\n\nThese pigments come from the algae and small crustaceans that flamingos eat. The more of these pigments they consume, the more intense their pink color becomes! 🌸\n\nInterestingly, flamingos are not born with their signature pink hue; they're actually grey or white when they hatch. The pink color develops after they start eating foods rich in carotenoids.\n\nSo, there you have it! 💛 Flamingos' pink feathers are a result of their diet's colorful contribution. 🌈",
