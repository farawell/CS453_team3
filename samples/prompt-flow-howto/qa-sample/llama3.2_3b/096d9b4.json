It's a vital process that sustains our planet's ecosystems and supports life in all its forms.\n\n**The Main Steps:**\n\n1. **Evaporation**: The sun heats up water in oceans, lakes, rivers, and even plants, causing it to evaporate into the air as water vapor.\n2. **Condensation**: As water vapor rises into the atmosphere, it cools down and condenses into tiny droplets, forming clouds.\n3. **Precipitation**: When these droplets become too heavy to stay suspended in the air, they fall back to the Earth's surface as precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, or hail).\n4. **Runoff**: Once the precipitation reaches the ground, it flows over the surface as runoff, eventually making its way into bodies of water.\n5. **Infiltration**: Some of the precipitation seeps into the soil and becomes groundwater, recharging aquifers.\n\n**The Cycle Repeats:**\n\nThe water cycle is an ongoing process that's constantly recycling water between the Earth's oceans, atmosphere, and land. This journey can take anywhere from a few hours to thousands of years, depending on the specific location and conditions.\n\nðŸŒŸ Fun Fact: The water cycle is responsible for about 1% of the Earth's energy balance, making it a vital component of our planet's climate system!",
