  "Expected Output": "100°C",
  "Reasoning": "Ensures the answer is brief and relevant without extra information.",
  "model": "llama3.2:3b",
  "actualOutput": "**Hot Stuff! 🌡️**\n\nThe boiling point of water is 100°C (212°F) at standard atmospheric pressure. However, it's worth noting that the boiling point can vary depending on factors such as:\n\n* Altitude: Water boils at a lower temperature when you're high up in the mountains.\n* Pressure: Water boils at a higher temperature when the pressure is increased, like in a pressure cooker.\n\nBut at sea level and standard conditions, 100°C (212°F) is the boiling point of water! 😊",
