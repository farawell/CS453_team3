These gases trap heat from the sun, leading to a rise in global temperatures.\n\n**The science behind it**\n\nHuman activities like burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), deforestation, and land-use changes have increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to:\n\n1. **Heat trapping**: Greenhouse gases prevent heat from escaping back into space, causing the Earth's temperature to rise.\n2. **Rising sea levels**: Melting polar ice caps and glaciers contribute to sea-level rise, which can lead to coastal erosion, flooding, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources.\n3. **Extreme weather events**: Climate change is linked to an increase in intense heatwaves, droughts, floods, and storms.\n\n**The impact**\n\nClimate change affects us all:\n\n* **Health**: Warmer temperatures increase the spread of diseases, heat stress, and other health problems.\n* **Ecosystems**: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns disrupt ecosystems, leading to species extinctions and food insecurity.\n* **Human migration**: Rising sea levels, droughts, and extreme weather events force people to migrate or face displacement.\n\n**What can we do?**\n\nIndividual actions, collective efforts, and policy changes can mitigate climate change:\n\n1. **Reduce energy consumption**: Use renewable energy sources, turn off lights, and reduce waste.\n2. **Eat sustainably**: Choose plant-based diets, reduce food waste, and support regenerative agriculture.\n3. **Use public transport or walk/bike**: Reduce carbon emissions from transportation.\n4. **Support climate policies**: Advocate for clean energy, green infrastructure, and climate-resilient development.\n\nRemember, every small action counts, and collective action can lead to significant positive change! üåü",
