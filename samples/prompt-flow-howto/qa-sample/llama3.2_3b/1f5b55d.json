It's like a secret underground internet! \n\nFor example, when one tree is attacked by insects or disease, it can release chemical signals into the fungal network, which are then picked up by nearby trees. The affected tree can even warn its neighbors about potential threats, helping them to boost their defenses.\n\nIsn't that cool? ðŸ¤¯",
