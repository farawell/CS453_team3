Australia/Oceania\n5. Europe\n6. North America\n7. South America\n\nHowever, some sources may group Europe and Asia together as a single continent, Eurasia, or consider other groupings like the 6-continent model (Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America) or even more! ðŸ¤¯ But the 7-continent model is the most widely accepted.\n\nWould you like to know more about any of these continents? ðŸ˜Š",
