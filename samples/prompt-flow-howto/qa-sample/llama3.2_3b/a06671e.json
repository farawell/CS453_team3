  "actualOutput": "🤔 Exciting question! There are 4 main states of matter, and I'm here to break them down for you in simple terms.\n\n### States of Matter:\n\n1. **Solid**\nA solid has a fixed shape and volume. The particles (atoms or molecules) in a solid are closely packed and vibrate in place. Examples: rocks, metals, ice 🧊\n\n2. **Liquid**\nA liquid takes the shape of its container, but still has a fixed volume. The particles in a liquid are close together but can move freely past each other. Examples: water, oil, juice 💧\n\n3. **Gas**\nA gas expands to fill its container and takes both shape and volume. The particles in a gas are widely spaced and are free to move in any direction. Examples: air, helium, steam ☁️\n\n4. **Plasma** (sometimes considered the 5th state of matter)\nA plasma is an ionized gas consisting of positively charged ions and free electrons. It often occurs at high temperatures or with high-energy radiation. Examples: stars, lightning 🔋\n\nThere are also some more exotic states of matter like:\n* **Bose-Einstein Condensates** (supercool liquids that exhibit quantum behavior)\n* **Superfluids** (liquids with zero viscosity that can flow without resistance)\n* **Fermionic condensates** (a type of superfluid)\n\nBut we'll stop there! 🎉 Do you have any questions about the states of matter? 😊",
