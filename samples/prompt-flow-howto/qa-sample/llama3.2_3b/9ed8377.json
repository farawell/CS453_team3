  "actualOutput": "🐬💦 Ah, a fin-tastic question! 🤣\n\nDolphins are not technically fish, despite being often referred to as \"sea horses\" or included in the marine animal family tree with them.\n\nDolphins belong to a group called cetaceans, which also includes whales and porpoises. Cetaceans are mammals, just like humans! They give birth to live young, nurse their babies with milk, and breathe air at the surface of the water.\n\nHowever, dolphins do have some characteristics that might lead you to think they're fish:\n\n* **Streamlined bodies**: Like fish, dolphins have torpedo-shaped bodies that help them swim quickly through the water.\n* **Scales**: Dolphins don't have scaly skin like fish, but they do have a thin layer of keratin (the same protein that makes up human hair and nails) on their skin.\n* **Fins and flippers**: Like fish, dolphins use fins to propel themselves through the water.\n\nSo while dolphins are not \"fish\" in the classical sense, they're certainly fascinating marine creatures with some amazing adaptations! 🌊💖",
