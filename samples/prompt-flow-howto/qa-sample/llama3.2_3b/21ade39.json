  "actualOutput": "ðŸŒž I'm happy to help clarify! ðŸ˜Š\n\nNo, the Sun is not considered a planet. A planet is typically defined as a large celestial body that orbits around a star.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The Sun is a **star**, meaning it's a massive ball of hot, glowing gas that generates its own light and heat.\n* Planets, on the other hand, are usually much smaller and cooler than stars.\n* According to our solar system's definition, planets are celestial bodies that:\n\t+ Orbit around a star.\n\t+ Are in orbit around the Sun.\n\t+ Have sufficient mass to assume a hydrostatic equilibrium shape (i.e., they're nearly round in shape).\n\t+ Have cleared the neighborhood around their orbital path.\n\nThe Sun doesn't meet this last criterion, as it's part of a binary star system with the star Proxima Centauri. Additionally, its massive size and gravitational influence make it difficult to consider it a planet in the classical sense!\n\nSo, while the Sun is the center of our solar system, it's not classified as a planet ðŸ˜Š.",
