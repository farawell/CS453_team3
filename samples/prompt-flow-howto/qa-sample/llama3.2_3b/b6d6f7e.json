It's a fundamental force of nature that affects us all, making things fall towards each other and keeping our feet on the ground.\n\nGravity is a type of attraction between objects with mass (things that take up space and have weight). The more massive the objects, the stronger their gravitational pull. ðŸ¤¯\n\nImagine you're standing on Earth, holding a ball. If you let go, what happens? The ball falls to the ground, right? That's because the Earth's mass is pulling on the ball with an invisible force called gravity.\n\nGravity is also what keeps us attached to our planet, which is why we don't float off into space! ðŸŒŠ\n\nBut here's the cool thing about gravity: it's not just limited to giant planets and stars. It's a universal force that affects everything with mass, from tiny atoms to massive galaxies!\n\nSo, there you have it â€“ gravity in a nutshell (or a ball, haha!). If you have any more questions or want to explore further, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š",
