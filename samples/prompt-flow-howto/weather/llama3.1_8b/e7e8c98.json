Yes, folks, it's going to be a drizzly day, so do pack those umbrellas and waterproof jackets (or just wear a nice poncho, we won't judge 😉).\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: 'What about tomorrow?' 🤔 Well, let me tell you, things might look up (literally!) by the time Thursday rolls around. But for now, just enjoy your coffee, grab an extra blanket, and try to find some sunshine in all this grey ☁️.\n\nStay dry out there, friends! 💦\""
