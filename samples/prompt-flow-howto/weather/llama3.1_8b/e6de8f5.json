  "output": "**Sunday Funday (Not Really)**\n\nWell, well, well! Look who's bracing themselves for a chilly Sunday morning 🌫️! It's November 19th, folks, and the forecast is calling for a crisp cold wake-up, with a temperature of 10°C. Now, I know what you're thinking... \"Is it sweater weather yet?\" And to that, I say... absolutely! 😂 It's time to break out the cozy cardigans and fluffy socks, because, let's be real, it's not exactly tropical outside 🌴.\n\nNow, if you were expecting some sun-kissed skies, I'm afraid you're in for a disappointment. The forecast is calling for mostly cloudy conditions, with just a hint of sunlight peeking through the clouds now and then ☀️. But hey, at least it's not raining... yet 🤞. So go ahead, grab that cuppa (or two, or three...) and snuggle up on your couch with a good book, because it's going to be one of those cozy Sundays where you just wanna stay indoors all day 😴.\n\n**Today's Forecast: Chilly Sunday**\n(compared to today, November 19th)"
