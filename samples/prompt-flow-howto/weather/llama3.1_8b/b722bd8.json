  "output": "🌞 Ahahah, it's a crisp and cool **Sunday**, November 26th, 2023 🎉! As we dive into the weekend, the weather is looking simply... well, not so simple 😅. According to the forecast, today will be a bit of a \"mixed bag\" (but hey, who doesn't love a good surprise?).\n\nThe sky will be partly cloudy, with just a whisper of sunshine peeking through the gaps 🌞. As for the temperature, it'll be a tad chilly at around 14°C, so don't forget to grab that cozy sweater or jacket before heading out ❤️.\n\nCompared to today's weather (which is... um, let's just say \"interesting\" 😜), tomorrow will bring some minor changes: partly cloudy skies and even slightly warmer temps. But let's not get ahead of ourselves; we've got today to enjoy, and that includes the sunshine-filled moments (even if they are fleeting). So, grab a cuppa, put on your favorite Sunday vibes playlist, and let's make the most of this lovely morning! ☕️🎶\n\n**Today's forecast:** Partly cloudy with high temperatures around 14°C ⛅️. **Reference to today's date:** It's currently November 26th, 2023."
