  "output": "**Tuesday, November 28th, 2023 🌞**\n\nWell, hello there! It's a chilly Tuesday morning outside (no kidding, right? 😒) and if you're anything like me, you're probably thinking about where to find the nearest hot chocolate. ☕️ But seriously, the mercury has dropped to a nippy 12°C today, so bundle up and get ready for a brisk day ahead.\n\nThe good news is that it's not going to be a complete washout, but do expect some partly cloudy skies with a gentle breeze blowing at about 10 km/h. No rain in sight, thank goodness! ☁️ But don't let your guard down just yet; we're expecting things to get even cooler tonight, so make sure you've got that cozy sweater ready for the evening.\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of the week, this is actually a bit warmer than **today** (which is a balmy 9°C, if I might add 😉), but still pretty cool overall. So, pack those scarves and gloves, folks! It's going to be a chilly few days, but hey, at least we can enjoy the crisp air, right? 😊"
