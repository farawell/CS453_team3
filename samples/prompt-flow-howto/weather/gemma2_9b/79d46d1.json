  "output": "Well folks! 🤪  Today is lookin' like a right treat with this sunshine we're having, but hold onto your hats 'cause come **Saturday, November 25th**, things are gonna get a bit nippy.  We're talkin' about a cool **16°C** - still mild compared to today's balmy weather, but definitely time to grab that extra layer if you're heading out! Think of it like this: your jacket will be happy, your dog might be confused why you suddenly need more layers, and you'll feel like a warm snuggle puddle thanks to the crisp autumn air. 🍂✨  \n\n\n"
