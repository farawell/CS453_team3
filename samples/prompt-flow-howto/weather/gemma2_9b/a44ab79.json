We're looking at a delightful dip to 12°C 🥶, which is basically the same chill as today but let's be honest, who actually enjoys being outside in this weather anyway? 🤔 It’ll probably feel like walking into a refrigerator, so grab your warmest sweaters and prepare for some serious snuggling!  ☔️ Might also want to keep an umbrella handy, just in case those clouds decide to unleash a bit of drizzle. 🌂 But hey, at least it won't be snowing...yet!   ❄️\n\n\n"
