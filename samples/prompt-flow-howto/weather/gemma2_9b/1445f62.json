  "output": "Alright, folks, buckle up because tomorrow, **Thursday, November 2nd**, is looking like a real scorcher! 🔥 🌡️  We're talking a balmy 22°C, which means you can ditch those bulky sweaters and embrace the sunshine (and maybe even rock that cute summer dress hiding in your closet). It's a whole 😜  degrees warmer than today, so make sure to lather on that sunscreen! 😎  But remember, this warmth won't last forever. Winter is coming... but for now, let's enjoy every glorious sunny moment! ☀️\n\n\n"
