  "output": "Okay, buckle up buttercup, because Tuesday (November 21st) is gonna be a real doozy! 🌦️ We're talking sunshine practically begging you to go outside and bask in its glorious rays. 😎 It might even tempt you to do a little dance under the clear blue skies... or at least crack open a window for some fresh air!  The temp will be hitting a pleasant 19°C, just like today 🔥 but with that crisp autumn air that means cozy sweaters are still totally in season. So go ahead, enjoy the good vibes and maybe even grab an ice cream cone – you deserve it!🍦   \n\nRemember, this forecast is based on the magical powers of AI, not actual meteorology knowledge 😉  \n"
