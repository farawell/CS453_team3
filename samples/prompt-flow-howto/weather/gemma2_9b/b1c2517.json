  "output": "Well folks, buckle up because Wednesday, November 29th is gonna be a right corker! Forget your cozy sweaters today, because a balmy 21°C will have you feeling like you're already on a tropical vacation - even if you're just walking to the bus stop.  Think sunshine beaming down, birds chirping happy little tunes, and maybe even a cheeky picnic in the park if you're feeling adventurous 🥪☀️🐦. It'll be about as delightful as today but with an extra sprinkle of \"I can finally wear sandals\" magic ✨!\n\n\n"
