Picture this: clouds swirling like a flock of confused pigeons, with sunlight peeking through like it's trying to make an escape 🤪. It'll be a breezy day, perfect for flying your kite or dramatically sweeping strands of hair out of your eyes 😉. Temperatures will hover around a cozy 14°C, so wear layers - you know, just in case those pigeons decide to stage a full-on feathered frenzy!  😎\n\n\n\n"
