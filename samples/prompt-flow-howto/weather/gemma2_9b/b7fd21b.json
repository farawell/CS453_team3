  "output": "Alright folks, buckle up because Monday's gonna be a scorcher!  🔥 We're talking about a glorious 20°C on this fine November 27th - just  a smidge warmer than the chill we're feeling today.  Get ready for sunshine practically bursting from the sky and making your plants jealous. 😎 Think picnics in the park, impromptu frisbee sessions, and maybe even breaking out those sleeveless shirts you thought were retired for the year! Just remember to slather on that sunscreen, folks - a little protection goes a long way against this beaming goodness.  ☀️😎 \n\n\n"
