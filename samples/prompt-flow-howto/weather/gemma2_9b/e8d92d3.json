  "output": "Well folks, get ready to pack those sweaters because next Wednesday (2023-11-08) is lookin' a bit chilly!  We're talkin' a crisp 17Â°C, which is a whole degree cooler than our lovely average for today. Think of it like this: imagine a light jacket with sleeves that your arms could actually fit in, 'cause that's what Wednesday's wearing.  Might want to grab a hot chocolate and curl up with a good book by the fire ðŸ”¥ ðŸ“š!\n\n\n"
