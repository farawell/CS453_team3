  "output": "Well, hey there sunshine! ☀️ It looks like this Saturday (that's TODAY for you!), November 11th, will be a wee bit chillier than our current cozy temperatures. Get ready for a crisp 14°C, so snuggle up in those sweaters – think of it as extra warmth for all those spooky Halloween candy remnants! 🎃👻  We're talking clear skies and sunshine peeking through, perfect for a leisurely stroll or maybe even a pumpkin carving contest 😉\n\n\n"
