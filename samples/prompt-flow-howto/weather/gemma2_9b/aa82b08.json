  "output": "Alright folks, buckle up for Friday, November 24th! ðŸ‘‹ It's going to be a gloriously warm one, with temperatures soaring to a balmy 23Â°C.  That's like, *basically* summer again, right? ðŸ˜Ž Ditch the heavy coat you've probably been dragging around today and break out the shorts â€“ or at least the lighter jacket.  We're talking sunshine galore, perfect for picnics in the park or maybe even a spontaneous dance party on your front lawn (judgement-free zone here ðŸ•º).  Just don't forget the sunscreen! It's going to be bright out there.  \n\n\n"
