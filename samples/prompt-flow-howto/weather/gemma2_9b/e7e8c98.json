  "output": "Alright folks, buckle up for Wednesday, November 15th! 🥶 That's just a few days from now, so make sure to dust off your cozy sweaters because things are about to get chillier.  We're looking at a brisk 18°C, which is a bit of a dip from today's pleasant vibes.   Think sweater weather, but don't worry, you won't need to trade in your sunshine for snow boots just yet.  It might be slightly cloudy with a chance of feeling like the dog days are officially over 😂🐶. \n\n\n"
