  "output": "Alright folks, buckle up!  According to my super secret weather goggles 🔮, next Monday (that's November 20th for those of you living in the past 🗓️), we're looking at a pleasant **18°C**. That means it'll be a bit warmer than today when I had to practically wear a sweater and scarf just to get across the room 🥶.  Prepare for some sunshine beaming down like disco balls ✨, perfect for grabbing an iced coffee (or a hot chocolate if you're one of *those* people) ☕ and soaking up those autumn vibes. Don't forget your shades 😎!\n\n\n"
