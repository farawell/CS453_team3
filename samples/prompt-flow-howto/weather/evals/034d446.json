Either way, your sunglasses and umbrella might make an unlikely duo! 😎🌂\n\nAfternoon: Expect temperatures to remain at a crisp 14°C, the kind of weather that's great for testing how many layers you can wear without looking like a marshmallow. 🔥🧥\n\nEvening: Snuggle time! 🌙 Temperatures will cool down, inviting you to cozy up with a hot drink. Just be cautious not to spill it all over yourself while pretending to be a weather announcer. ☕🎤\n\nEnjoy the unpredictably predictable weather of Saturday!"
