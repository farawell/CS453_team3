Get ready to kick off your weekend with a day that's as indecisive as your wardrobe choices! We've got a temperature of 16°C, which means you might find yourself in that awkward zone between \"too chilly for shorts\" and \"too warm for a jacket.\" 😅\n\nThe sky will be playing peek-a-boo with the sun, so keep your sunglasses handy, or you might find yourself doing the squint-and-stumble dance. 🤓🌞\n\nFriday's looking perfect for a coffee run, a brisk walk, or just pondering the mysteries of life—and by that, I mean wondering why you wore that sweater when it's clearly not sweater weather. 🤔🧥\n\nSo, grab your favorite beverage, throw on some layers, and remember: weather is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get! 🍫☕️\n\nEnjoy your Friday, folks! 🎉"
