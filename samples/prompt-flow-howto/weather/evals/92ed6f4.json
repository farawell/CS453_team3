Perfect for those who like their weather lukewarm, like tea that's been left out but is still drinkable! 🍵\n\n🌬️ **Winds:** A gentle breeze, just enough to mess up your hair but not strong enough to blow away your fabulous Sunday hat. 🎩\n\n☁️ **Clouds:** A few clouds playing hide and seek, but nothing that will stop the sun from showing off its dance moves. ☁️➡️🌞\n\n🌈 **Chance of Rain:** Slight. Just enough to keep you on your toes, or to keep your umbrella company in your bag. ☔\n\n🍂 **Activities:** Perfect for a stroll in the park, or a lazy day of doing absolutely nothing while pretending to do something. 🛋️\n\nRemember, Sundays are for recharging your batteries... or at least pretending to while binge-watching your favorite shows! 📺🎉\n\n"
