It's 18°C, which means it's too cold for shorts but too warm for that snazzy new winter coat. 🤔\n\nExpect a sky that’s more moody than a teenager without Wi-Fi. Clouds will be playing peek-a-boo, but don’t worry, they’re not planning on crying on your parade today! ☁️🌤️\n\nPerfect weather for sipping a hot beverage while pretending to work from home. ☕📚\n\nBe sure to enjoy this confusion of a day, and remember, it's only Monday. So if you’re feeling a bit meh, blame it on the weather! 😉"
