  "output": "Hey there, meteorology enthusiasts! 🌄 Today on our weather radar, we're looking at a chilly Tuesday where the temperatures are nipping at your heels like frosty fingers. With today's forecast coming in at an icy low of just 12°C (that’s minus 9°F for my American friends out there), you better pack those woolen jumpers and perhaps even a scarf to stay cozy as we venture into this wintry landscape! 🛁❄️ As the temperatures fall, expect some crisp morning breezes that'll make your nose crinkle with delight. So here's to cold showers and frosty mornings; it looks as though you might need to invest in one of those handy heated blankets for all-nighters ahead. Stay tuned as this forecast is updated daily, but if today feels more like a wintery winter storm than just chilly temperatures, let me know - I’d love the chance to play dress-up with snowflakes and perhaps even have some hot cocoa sessions around my crackling fireplace! 😍❄️ #weatherforecast"
