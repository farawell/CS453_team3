  "output": "Today's sun beams down on a warm and sunny Sunday, with temperatures reaching a cozy and gentle 24°C across the land. You can expect to be feeling extra snuggly under your favorite blanket or enjoying a leisurely afternoon by the fireplace as we look ahead to this weekend forecast. 🌞❄️ It feels like spring has finally sprung, making us all want to head outside for some nature walks and backyard barbecues. Keep an umbrella ready though, because these sunny spells often come with brief showers and cool breezes that make the temperature feel more moderate than it might be on the thermometer. Just as a reminder, this forecast is compared to today's weather which was surprisingly mild at 20°C, adding another degree of warmth which is truly delightful in comparison! 🌤️✨\n\nRemember, if you're planning any outdoor activities, make sure your clothes are layerable and pack a lightweight jacket or sweater for when the clouds decide it’s time to play dress-up with raindrops. Happy sun-soaking and umbrella-wearing fellow weather enthusiasts! ☀️🌧️"
