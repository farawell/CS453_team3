  "output": "On this crisp Monday morning, as we look ahead to the festive and slightly warmer day on December 4th, the skies are expected to paint a beautiful scene of scattered clouds with here and there bursts of sunbeams. Temperatures won't let you shiver; they'll be nudging closer to your comfort zone at around 17 degrees Celsius. It’s going to feel like a cozy hug from the sun as it breaks through those thin, wispy clouds, warming up the air just enough to make you want to reach for that morning cup of coffee or hot chocolate. So gear up in layers - grab a scarf and possibly even a light jacket if you're venturing outside; this weather is about to be your new best friend as it offers just the right amount of warmth without being overwhelmingly warm.\n\nRemember, though, with such pleasant temperatures forecasted for what feels like a more balmy day on December 4th, don’t forget to check back in later today or next week. The forecast can change swiftly and the holiday season means it’s still that time of year when temps might take a bit of a dip.\n\nSo go ahead and make the most of this mild winter wonderland; you’re in for some seriously cozy weather vibes! 🌞❄️ #ComfortableWeathers"
