  "output": "Hey there frostbitten Thursdays! As you step outside on this beautiful November Thursday, watch out for a nice nip of cool air that's just below the bone-chilling mark. With temperatures nudging at a comfortable but brisk 25Â°C, it feels like a chilly hug from the weather gods trying to coax you indoors for your favorite sweater day. \n\nThe forecast is looking pretty much like today - only cooler! So if you were enjoying some outdoor activities on what felt like summer in November last week, now's a great time to bundle up and head out again. Your friends might not believe it as they see the sunny skies with sprinkles of white clouds; I mean, who wouldn't think it's still hot outside? The good news is that even though it feels colder, you'll have plenty of warm weather gear available to keep you snug from every chill. ðŸ˜„\n\nStay tuned for more updates and remember: Always pack a jacket when you're stepping out into the unpredictable November night!"
