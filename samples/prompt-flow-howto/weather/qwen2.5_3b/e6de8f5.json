  "output": "Hey there, weather enthusiasts! 🌞 On our fun and frothy Sunday in the year of our Lord 2023, we're currently noshing on a chilly soup of temperatures at a frosty 10 degrees Celsius. Picture this: you wake up to see your morning cuppa tea already giving off clouds of steam as it warms from room temperature to drinkable bliss. The sky is a serene shade of blue that looks almost like someone spilled a can of Pringles on the horizon. As we look ahead at next week's forecast, expect some sunny days with just a sprinkle (or shall I say, a drizzle) of cooler temperatures. Stay cozy and bring a scarf if you're heading outside! 🌧️❄️ #SundaySeascape #WinterWear"
