  "output": "Hey there, stormy weather enthusiasts! It's a balmy Sunday greeting from the forecasters, and you can thank me for not suggesting we start our beach trips just yet. With temps at an impressively cool 19°C today, it'll feel like a gentle hug from the sun rather than a full-on embrace. \n\nGather up those cozy sweaters because while this chilly front is sweeping in mid-morning, you can expect temperatures to hover around that perfect golden hour mark by the afternoon. The sky will be clear and free of clouds, allowing your spirit to soar along with those crisp high-fives everyone's giving each other at noon.\n\nIf you were planning on playing a game of frisbee or tennis in the park later today, keep an eye out for some light breezes that might just cause your shirt to flutter ominously. But fear not, because these will only last until twilight when they'll whisk away like yesterday's rain after the sunset. So grab those beach towels and hats from yesterday’s trip tomorrow instead of planning a picnic today.\n\nAnd let's not forget about tonight. Yes, we're talking chilly tonight! Temperatures may dip as low as 10°C by then. You can expect some fine mist hovering over everything while you enjoy that warm chocolate milk in the comfort of your home or cozy up to the fireplace like it’s never been done before.\n\nThis forecast might sound a bit harsh and cold, but remember, even a good chill is better than being trapped under an oppressive heat wave! So bundle up tight tonight, and we'll all keep our fingers crossed for some warmer temps in the coming days. Stay safe out there, you weather wizards! 🌞❄️"
