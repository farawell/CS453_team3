  "output": "Hey there, citizens of the metropolis! Today’s weather is a delightful blend of sunshine and warmth that will surely leave you feeling like a king or queen on your special Tuesday. Tempting temperatures will soar to those oh-so-familiar 20°C in cozy little pockets across our town, so grab yourself a warm scarf but don't forget about the sunscreen – we've got plenty of bright, clear skies and low chance of any pesky clouds or showers. It's like basking in nature's own spa day, complete with mild breezes to keep you feeling refreshed. You thought summer was far away? Think again! The forecast looks just as inviting on 2023-12-05, so pack those flippers and sunscreen if you’re planning any beach days – or even better, just relax under a large umbrella while you work your way through that massive stack of unread books. Stay cool out there, folks!\n🌞 ☀️ 🌄 🌅 🍂"
