  "output": "Oh boy, here's what the skies are holding for you on this crisp and sunny Wednesday! 🌞 The mercury is dipping down to an icy 13°C today, making it feel like a gentle rain of icicles has just started falling from the sky. Imagine stepping outside and being enveloped in that chilly mist, ready to steal your breath away with its chilly kiss. Soak up those last rays before they turn into clouds, because by Wednesday afternoon, expect skies to clear out as we prepare for a gorgeous sunny Saturday forecast. But don't go running around like you're about to catch a chill—remember to bundle up in layers of sweaters and scarves. After all, when it comes to chilly weather, always err on the side of caution with your wardrobe choices. Stay warm, stay dry—and grab some hot cocoa! ☕️❄️ #WeatherUpdate\n\nP.S. The forecast for Saturday looks like a beautiful sunny day ahead, so no need to pack those coats just yet. Just make sure you’ve got your sunblock handy instead. 🌞💕"
