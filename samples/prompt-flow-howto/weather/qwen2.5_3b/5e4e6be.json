  "output": "Whooaaaa, Wednesday is here already! 🌞 With the forecast hitting a toasty 23 degrees Celsius, you can expect sunny skies and a blast of warmness wafting through town. I mean, who doesn't love a nice, balmy Wednesday? 😎 This heat wave looks like it's just warming up, not cooling down anytime soon. 🌬️ So grab that favorite sweater (you know the one with the bear on it) and make sure your indoor air conditioning is ready to kick in whenever you feel those first mild signs of a chill creeping into the evening. It’s looking to be another scorching Wednesday ahead, folks! 🌞🌞🌞\n\nComparing this forecast to today:\nToday (as of 2023-12-06), if we have any cooler air circulating around, it'll likely feel more like a cool breeze rather than the blazing sun rays we're looking at here for December. But either way, make sure your hat and gloves are packed because temperatures will definitely be climbing come tomorrow! 🏋️‍♀️👨‍♂️\n\nRemember to drink plenty of water so you don't end up as a weather statistician (like one too many ice cream cones on the hot days). Keep hydrated and stay cool, friends! ☕️🏊‍♂️"
