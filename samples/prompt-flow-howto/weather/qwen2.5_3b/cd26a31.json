  "output": "Hey there, fellow Thursday night warriors! 🌝 As the chill of autumn begins to really set in, you're likely snuggled up with a warm blanket and cozy socks. Today's forecast on November 23rd is sending us some lovely cool temperatures—just perfect for those gentle breezes that rustle through our town like pages turning in an old book. Temperatures tonight are dropping down to a chillier 17°C, which means you might want to wrap up in your favorite sweater before hopping into bed. Don't forget the extra socks and warm slippers – it's going to be chilly where you are! 😴❄️\n\nThe last time we checked on this forecast compared to today, things were even colder with temperatures dropping down to 15°C around mid-week. But hey, at least your cozy sweaters will stay in fashion longer now! 🧥😊\n\nStay dry and warm, folks! Let’s make the most of these crisp autumn evenings together. Enjoy a cuppa or maybe some s'mores if you can find a nice spot to roast them under those cool but pleasant skies. 😄marshmallow_notification 🍪🔥\n\nP.S.: Don’t forget your rain boots if you’re headed out tomorrow morning for that weekly grocery run! 😧👟"
