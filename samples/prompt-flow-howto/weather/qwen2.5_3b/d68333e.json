  "output": "Oh man, here we are on this frosty Friday morning as the chill from last night's nip lingers with a current temperature of a crisp and cool 13 degrees Celsius. Imagine stepping outside to find an air so cold it could make your breath disappear into thin air! Frost is creeping in on the ground like tiny white fingers as patches of ice start forming, creating a picturesque but hazardous scene for those who haven't prepared their car’s windshield with frost-melting sprays yet 🌨️❄️. \n\nThe forecast for tomorrow indicates even colder temperatures to keep it real and challenging for outdoor enthusiasts! So make sure you bundle up like a polar bear preparing to brave the frozen winds, lest we're entering the land of eternal icicles. Stay safe out there! ☃️"
