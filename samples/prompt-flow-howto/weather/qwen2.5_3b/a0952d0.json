  "output": "Hey there, folks! On this crisp and cool Monday morning, we're looking at a comfortable 18°C. Not too hot, just right after waking up. The sky is as blue as your new favorite shirt (if you haven't already picked one out), with the occasional fluffy cloud that seems to be saying \"Let's play!\" You can almost hear the leaves rustling in perfect harmony just outside your window. 🌅☀️\n\nIf you're wondering how this compares to yesterday, well, it was a bit warmer then, so let's go through some specifics. Yesterday saw temperatures pushing a degree or two higher. The wind wasn't too strong either—probably due to the forecast being a tad more predictable than my mood on Mondays! 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️\n\nBut hey, there’s always tomorrow… and what does it have in store? Well, let's keep our fingers crossed for slightly cooler temperatures. I mean, nothing beats getting caught off guard by unexpected highs after such a pleasant start to the week. Stay tuned for updates, but maybe stock up on some warm sweaters just in case we don’t meet those cooler forecasted lows! 🛋️😊"
