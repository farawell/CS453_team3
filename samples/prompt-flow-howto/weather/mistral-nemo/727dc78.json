  "output": "Alright folks, buckle up for a ride through the skies on this fine Sunday! 🌞 Today we're blasting off to December 3rd, 2023, where it's feeling like an absolutely balmy 19°C - that's like a hot water bottle for your soul! But hold onto your hats, because we've got a bit of a breeze blowing in from the east. It's not quite enough to turn you into Mary Poppins, but it might just give you a little skip in your step. Now, don't go expecting any snowflakes dancing in the air on this date, it's still too early for that kind of magic. So, pack your sunscreen and your sense of adventure, because it's going to be another sunny day in the making! 🌍💨"
