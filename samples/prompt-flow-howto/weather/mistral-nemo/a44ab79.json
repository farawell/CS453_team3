  "output": "Oh, what a day! It's like the calendar gods decided to play \"Guess The Season\" on us. Today is Tuesday, the 28th of November - that's right, it's nearly December and we're still in that \"Is it winter yet?\" limbo. But hey, don't let that stop you from embracing the chill! It's a cool 12°C out there 🌡️, perfect for those who enjoy feeling like a human icicle while sipping on their pumpkin spice latte ☕️👻."
