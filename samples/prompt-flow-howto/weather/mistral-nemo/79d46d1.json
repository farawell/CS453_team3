But hold onto your hats, because come November 25th, we're rolling back the years to when grandma used to make us wear woollies on the beach! It'll be like winter decided to take up surfing, so brace yourself for a chilly 8°C dip. Brrr, grab your scarves and snow boots – summer must've taken a wrong turn at Albuquerque! ☃️🌊"
