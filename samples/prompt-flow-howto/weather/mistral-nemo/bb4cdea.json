We're sitting pretty at 20°C - perfect for a cozy picnic or an impromptu outdoor dance-off. But remember, it's still December, so don't go flashing your pasty Northern legs just yet! 💃🥶 Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some sunbathing to attend to. Stay warm, stay happy, and remember: If the weather gets too hot, you can always resort to some cold humor, am I right? 😂⛈️"
