  "output": "Alrighty folks, buckle up for a wild weather ride, 'cause we're talking about this coming Sunday, the 12th of November! 🌞✨\n\nSo, mark your calendars, because on this fine Sunday, we're looking at a temperature that's got me thinking it might've mistaken itself for spring break in Miami! It's a toasty 19°C, so it'll feel like you're dancing on the beach with a Piña Colada in hand – sans the sand between your toes. ☀️🍹\n\nNow, comparing this to today, well, it's like going from cozy sweater weather to practically shorts and flip-flops! So, start planning that picnic, because come Sunday, Mother Nature is serving up a sunshine platter just for you! 🌷🎉"
