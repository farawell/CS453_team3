Just a heads-up, on Wednesday, 2023-11-08, it's gonna be like we're stuck in a washing machine on a spin cycle all day long! 👕💨 It'll be a whopping 17°C chillier than today, so make sure to pack that woolly jumper, grandma-style. But don't worry, even with the rain, it's still warmer than my ex's heart! 🥲☔️ So grab your umbrella and embrace the wet, because remember, every cloud has a silver lining - unless you're standing right underneath one, then it's just rainy reality! 🌨️💦"
