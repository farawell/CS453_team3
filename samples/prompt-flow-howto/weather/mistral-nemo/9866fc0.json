  "output": "Oh boy, buckle up for the weekend's forecast, folks! 🤩 It's like Mother Nature decided to have a little beach party on Friday, November 17th, but with a twist of autumn chill. ⛱️❄️ You're looking at a sunny start, but don't get too comfy, it'll be like that scene from The Day After Tomorrow by late afternoon! 🌞🔴🎬 Just kidding, it's only going to dip down to 14°C. So, still not warm enough for a tan, but perfect for some apple picking or leaf crunching! 🍏🍂 Compared to today's cozy 20°C, this is like your grandma's living room on the cold side of the house – still lovable, just not as cuddly. 🥴👵"
