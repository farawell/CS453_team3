We're expecting temperatures to hover around 19Â°C, which is quite cozy and perfect for those late afternoon picnics. Imagine that, sun-kissed days with a gentle breeze just right! Not too hot, not too cold â€” itâ€™s the goldilocks weather zone.\n\nComparing this forecast to today's conditions, the temperature seems to have cooled down slightly. If you were out there sipping coffee and soaking up the warmth last Saturday, now might be more of a chill day with a gentle chill in the air. But donâ€™t worry, itâ€™s still warm enough for those light layers!\n\nRemember, folks, always stay hydrated and protect yourself from the sun's rays ðŸŒž, even on a seemingly mild day like this one! Have a wonderful Sunday out there!",
