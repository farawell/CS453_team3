The chill is in the air like a frosty blanket, with temperatures dropping down to a chilly 18°C by midday. Imagine if you could freeze your nose off just standing outside; that’s how cold it feels!\n\nBut let's not get too gloomy! While today was cool, expect a real winter wonderland on Monday, November 20th. The forecast calls for temperatures to plummet below freezing, sending shivers down even the bravest of hearts. You might want to wrap yourself up in extra layers and maybe even consider building a cozy fort with fallen leaves.\n\nSo, if you're planning any outdoor activities today, better pack your uggs and stay warm! And remember, it’s always a good idea to carry an umbrella with you just in case the weather decides to have a tantrum. After all, who doesn't love a bit of snow or at least a hint of a whiteout?",
