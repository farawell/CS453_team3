  "actualOutput": "**Thursday, November 2nd, 2023**\n\nToday feels like a prelude to a perfect storm. The sun is playing hide and seek behind fluffy clouds, casting everything in a soft, dreamy glow. But don't be fooled by the serene sky; expect a downpour later on. It's turning into a bit of a washout but make sure you grab an umbrella just in case. With temperatures hovering around 22°C, it might feel balmy at first, but the rain will soon cool things down.\n\nSo, if you decide to venture outside, be prepared for a mix of sun and showers, much like a giant's wardrobe gone wild. Wear layers and pack a pop-up umbrella for maximum protection. Stay dry and enjoy your day, no matter what Mother Nature throws at us! 🌦️🌞",
