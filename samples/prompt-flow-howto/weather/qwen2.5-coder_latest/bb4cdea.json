  "actualOutput": "**Tuesday, December 5th - The Frosty Forecast**\n\nToday feels like a prelude to Christmas with temperatures hovering around a comfortable 20°C. It’s just enough warmth to make you put on your gloves but not so much that you want to stay indoors. 🌨️✨ If you were expecting today’s weather to be anything like the fiery summer sun we’ve been having, think again. The forecast for Tuesday suggests a delightful chill in the air, perfect for those chilly evenings by the fireplace. Pack a jacket just in case, and maybe bring out that seasonal sweater – it looks like we’re still in the grip of autumn after all! 🎄💼",
