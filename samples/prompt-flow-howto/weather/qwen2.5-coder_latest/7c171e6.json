  "actualOutput": "**Weather Forecast for Friday, November 3rd, 2023**\n\nHey there, folks! 🌋 It looks like we're in for quite the chilly weekend, and I'm not just talking about the temperature. The forecast is calling for a high of just 10°C on our beautiful Friday afternoon, which feels more like a brisk winter day than anything else. So, make sure you grab your warmest layers because it's going to feel a bit like walking into a freezer outside.\n\nNow, compare that to today’s date, and let me tell you—it's like stepping back in time! Today is warmer, with a temperature of 15°C, but don't let the heat fool you, folks. Friday is looking more like that crisp, winter air we all love (minus the snow, because we're still talking about 10°C).\n\nRemember, whether it’s warm or cool, always be prepared for anything Mother Nature throws your way! Stay cozy and stay tuned for the rest of this week's forecast. 👍",
