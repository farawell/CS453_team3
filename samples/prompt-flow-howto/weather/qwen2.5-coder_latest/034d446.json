You might want to bundle up and grab that scarf because it’s looking like temperatures will hover around a crisp 14°C. That’s about as cold as a grumpy cat on a bad day. 🐱❄️ If you're thinking of venturing outside, it's probably best to stick to the indoors with your favorite mug of hot chocolate and a good book. Stay cozy, everyone! ☕📚",
