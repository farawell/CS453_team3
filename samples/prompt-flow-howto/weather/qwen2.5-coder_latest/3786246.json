That's about as warm as you might find yourself cuddling with a cozy blanket, but just enough to make you think twice about wearing multiple layers. \n\nThe sky is clear and blue, like when you look up at night during a meteor shower. There's a gentle breeze blowing, making it feel just right for that early afternoon picnic or those lazy afternoons spent reading by the window.\n\nSo, if you're planning to hit the slopes tomorrow (because let's face it, winter is only a few steps away), make sure you pack some warm layers and maybe a scarf. But today? Just bask in the sunshine and enjoy the 19-degree warmth like everyone else ðŸŒž. Itâ€™s almost perfect for a cozy day at home with a good book and a steaming cup of hot chocolate!",
