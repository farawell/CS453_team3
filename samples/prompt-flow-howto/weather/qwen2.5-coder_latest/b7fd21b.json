But if you're planning any outdoor adventures, be prepared for a little chill in the air. The sun will keep shining bright, casting long shadows and making sure we don't get stuck in too much darkness. Just remember to grab a sweater because we might see a few clouds rolling in by afternoon, turning our sunny day into a cozy, mild Monday afternoon. So, pack up those comfy sweaters and let's make this 20th-century Monday shine bright! ðŸ’¡ #ChillaxInTheCity",
