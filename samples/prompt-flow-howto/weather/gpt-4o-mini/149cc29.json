  "output": "Ahoy, weather warriors! 🌥️ Buckle up because this Friday, November 10th, is bringing you a delightful 16°C, which is just perfect for donning that snazzy jacket you’ve been meaning to show off! It's like Mother Nature said, \"Let’s keep it cool, but not too cool—just enough for a cheeky cup of hot chocolate!\" ☕ Expect a mix of clouds and sunshine, like a celestial game of peek-a-boo! Just remember, it might be a bit breezy, so hold onto your hats and maybe consider anchoring down your plans—wind can be a feisty little rascal! So, if you see clouds gathering, don’t fret; they’re just throwing a little party up there! Get out, enjoy the day, and maybe do some pre-weekend dancing... just watch out for those gusts! 💃🕺"
