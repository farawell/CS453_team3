Ah yes, it looks like there's a 30% chance of flurries tonight, with a dusting possible by morning. ❄️ But don't get too excited - it's not like we're expecting a snowmageddon or anything! 😉\n\nComparison to today: Well, as we've got clear skies and sunshine today (2023-12-05), tomorrow is expected to be quite the opposite - partly cloudy with those pesky flurries making an appearance. So, if you want to enjoy the sun and fresh air, make sure to get out there today! 🌞\n\nStay warm and cozy, friends! ❄️☕️",
