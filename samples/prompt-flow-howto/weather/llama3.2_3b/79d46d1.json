Don't worry, it won't be too bad, but you might want to grab that extra layer of cozy just in case!\n\nNow, here's where things get interesting: compared to today, the forecast for last Saturday (November 18th) was looking quite different, with a high of 20°C and plenty of sunshine. But don't expect those golden rays to make an appearance today - it's going to be more of a gloomy, overcast affair 🌫️.\n\nSo, what does that mean for you? Well, if you're planning on hitting the great outdoors, you might want to bundle up and enjoy the crisp air (it's not too bad, we promise!). And if you're stuck indoors, don't worry - there's always a good book or a comfy movie to snuggle up with 📚🍿.\n\nStay weather-aware, my friends! 😉",
