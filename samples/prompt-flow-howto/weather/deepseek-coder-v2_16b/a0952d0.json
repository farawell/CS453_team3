  "output": " Hey there! 🌤️ It's officially Monday, and guess what? The weather gods have blessed us with a crisp, cozy 18°C today! 😊 While it might be slightly chilly, the clear skies are perfect for those cozy outdoor activities you've been itching to do. Remember to layer up if you plan on being out all day—scarves, jackets, and maybe even a beanie could come in handy! 🧣🌂\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, November 20th (that's Monday), the weather forecast promises to be just as delightful but slightly warmer. We're talking about a high of around 20°C with partly cloudy skies. So, it should feel like a nice transition into fall without totally forgetting what summer felt like! 🍂🌤️\n\nSo get your sunglasses ready for tomorrow if you can, and don't forget to enjoy the pleasant weather—it's going to be a bright day regardless of whether you choose to spend it indoors or out! 🏖️☀️"
