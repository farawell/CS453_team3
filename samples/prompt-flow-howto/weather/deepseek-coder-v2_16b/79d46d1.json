  "output": " Hey there! 🌤️ Today's the big day - November 25th, a Saturday just like any other weekend should be. But guess what? The weather is gonna be SUPER special! 😊 With a mild temperature of 16°C, it's like Mother Nature decided to give everyone a big warm hug. Remember how chilly last week was? Well, this weekend, you can comfortably step out in your favorite sweater without freezing. What's up with that, huh? 🧣☀️\n\nAs for the forecast date of 2023-11-25, it's just around the corner and guess what? The weather will still be all about comfort! So whether you're planning a day out in the park or chilling at home with some hot cocoa, Mother Nature has got your back. It'll be quite pleasant, similar to today but perhaps a tad bit more chill in the air for those who love that brisk feel. Stay cozy and enjoy your weekend, folks! 😊🍂"
