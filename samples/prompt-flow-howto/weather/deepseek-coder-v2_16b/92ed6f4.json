  "output": " Ahoy! 🏴‍☠️ It's a fine Sunday afternoon where I stand at the helm of this weather ship. Today we set sail for November 12th, 2023. The seas are calm (or maybe just mimicking my calmness), with temperatures hovering around a mild 19°C. Expect a pleasant stroll in these breezy waters! 🌬️☀️\n\nNow, let's talk specifics about tomorrow, November 12th. Prepare to set sail for some fun in the sun (or should I say weather?) where the temperature will be just as cheerful as Jack Sparrow himself - around 19°C, making it a perfect day for those who love a touch of adventure under the sunny yet not-too-harsh sky.\n\nRemember folks, with every forecast is a little bit of humor and a whole lot of flair. So dress in layers if you're feeling adventurous or snuggle up with an extra sweater just to keep that spritely 19°C company! 🎩🌤️"
