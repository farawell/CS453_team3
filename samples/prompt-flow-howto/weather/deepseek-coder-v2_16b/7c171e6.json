  "output": " Let's get into the spirit of this spooky season with a forecast that feels like it could be plucked straight from a Halloween card! ðŸŽƒ On this very FRIDAY the 3rd of November, we're expecting a mild chill in the airâ€”just around 10Â°C. It might feel almost eerie how crisp and clear the weather is shaping up to be! So bundle up if you're heading out for any trick-or-treating (make sure to share your candy with me!). And remember, no tricks, just treats in the forecastâ€”just like a well-behaved ghost at a party. ðŸ˜Š"
