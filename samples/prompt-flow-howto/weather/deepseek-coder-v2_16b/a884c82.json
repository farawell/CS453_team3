It might be a bit chilly with a chill factor of 13°C, so bundle up or you'll catch a cold! 😷☔️\n\nRemember, Wednesday (the day before Thursday, which is Friday the 13th but don’t worry, it's just a number!) keeps things spooky and sunny with spirits high. So go ahead and wear that witch hat, it won't be too scary out there! 🧙‍♂️🌈"
