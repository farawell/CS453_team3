  "output": " Hey there! 🌤️ It's about to get real cozy on Monday, December 4th. With a mild temperature of 17°C, it's like Mother Nature decided to give everyone a big warm hug around the neck. Just a heads-up, it might be sweater weather for some and shorts weather for others, but one thing's for sure: there will be plenty of cozy vibes floating in the air! So bundle up if you feel chilly, or enjoy a light jacket stroll if you're feeling summery. Either way, it's going to be a pleasant day filled with that perfect fall chill mixed with some spring warmth—just like a quirky uncle who always brings an umbrella just in case but ends up sitting outside all day anyway! 🌼☀️"
