The temperature is not chilly but rather just right at 13°C. You might want to grab an umbrella because there could be some raindrops falling from the sky like tiny, friendly reminders to stay indoors and enjoy some cozy time. Compared to today, it's gonna be a tad cooler and possibly wetter. So, grab your favorite book or movie, and let's call Friday, December 1st a perfect \"hygge\" day! 🌧️☕️"
