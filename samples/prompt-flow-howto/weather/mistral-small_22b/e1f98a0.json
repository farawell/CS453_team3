  "output": " **Detailed Weather Forecast for December 4th, 2023 (Monday)!** 📅⏰\n\nOh boy, oh boy, oh boy! If today is hotter than a toaster's mood during summer, tomorrow is going to be milder than your favorite aunt who always brings the best pie at family gatherings. We're talking about a cozy 17°C, which is perfect for wearing that new scarf you just knitted (or bought, no judgments here!). So, grab your favorite book and a cup of hot cocoa because Monday is giving us those \"I'm-not-too-hot,-not-too-cold\" vibes. Compared to today, it's like trading in your too-tight jeans for some comfy yoga pants—bliss! 📚☕"
