Current temp is a breezy 12°C, but tomorrow? Brace yourselves! 🌪️ We're talking clouds that could make a painter jealous, and winds that'll leave your hairdo looking like you just stuck your finger in a light socket. So grab an umbrella, wear some layers, and get ready for a weather party that's gonna be lit—literally! 🔥💨"
