  "output": " Alright folks, grab your umbrellas and rain boots because we're in for a wet one on November 12th! 🌧️ It's gonna be like Mother Nature got her hands on a giant watering can and decided to go wild. Compared to today's balmy 19°C, it'll feel a tad chillier out there. So, if you were planning on picnicking in the park, maybe rethink that plan. But hey, at least your plants will be happy! 🌿💦"
