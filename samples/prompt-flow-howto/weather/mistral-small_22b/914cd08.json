We're talking 25Â°C here â€“ that's like having summer's last hurrah. It's a bit warmer than today, so maybe think about breaking out the shorts and flip-flops one more time before winter knocks on our door. Just remember to slap on some sunscreen â€“ we don't want any freckles turning into permanent residents! ðŸŒžâœ¨"
