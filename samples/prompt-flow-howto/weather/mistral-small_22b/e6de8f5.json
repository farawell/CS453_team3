You might wanna swap those shorts for some jeans, and if you've got a light jacket lying around, now's the time to dust it off. The sun will still be shining, so don't worry about rain playing spoilsport. It's like nature said, 'Let's give those folks a little chill to appreciate the warmth when it comes back!' Who's with me? ❄️🤗\""
