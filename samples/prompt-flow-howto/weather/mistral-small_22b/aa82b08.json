  "output": " **Weather Forecast for Friday, November 24th, 2023**\n\n Ahoy! It's like Mother Nature is throwing us a little party today, with temperatures all the way up to 23°C. It's basically a summer flashback in late autumn! Expect lots of sunshine and blue skies that will make you want to throw on your shades and enjoy an ice cream (or two). There might be a few wisps of cloud passing by, but they're just here for the party too! ☀️🍦\n\n**Today vs. Forecast:** Today was a bit more humdrum, wasn't it? But Friday is going to be an absolute showstopper – grab your sunscreen and get ready to soak up some rays! 🎉"
