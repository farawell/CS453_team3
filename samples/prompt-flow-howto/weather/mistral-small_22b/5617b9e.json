It's gonna be a scorcher out there tomorrow! 🔥 On November 5th—that's Sunday, folks—we're expecting temperatures to hit a balmy 24°C. That's like stepping into a warm hug from your favorite cozy sweater... except it won't fit because it's too hot! 😅 Compared to today, it'll feel like we've skipped right over autumn and landed in summer again. So grab your shades (and maybe an ice cream), and enjoy the sunny ride! Just remember to stay hydrated—you don't want to be a human popsicle by the end of the day. 🍦"
