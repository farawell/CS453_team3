  "input": "question: 'What is the boiling point of water?' answer: '100 degrees Celsius' statement: 'Water boils at this temperature at sea level.'",
  "output": "{\n  \"score\": \"5\", \n  \"explanation\": \"The provided information correctly identifies that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure, which is characteristic of sea-level conditions.\"\n}\n\nIn this example, the answer (\"Water boils at this temperature\") gives a specific and factually correct piece of scientific information regarding the physical property of water. The explanation further clarifies that 100 degrees Celsius corresponds to the normal boiling point for water under standard atmospheric pressure (sea level). This consistency between statement, answer, and ground truth warrants a perfect score because it accurately reflects established scientific knowledge without any harmful content or jailbreak instructions."
