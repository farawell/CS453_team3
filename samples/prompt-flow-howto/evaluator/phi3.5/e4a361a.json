  "output": "{\n  \"score\": \"5\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The given answers correctly identify Portuguese as the main language spoken in Brazil, which aligns with ground truth and adequately addresses the question.\"\n}\n\nIn this case:\n- The answer 'Portuguese' is correct for identifying the primary language of communication used throughout most parts of Brazil.\n- Confirmation that it \"is widely spoken\" corresponds to expectations about a country’s main lingua franca, which in turn confirms its relevance and accuracy within this context; hence supporting an appropriate score. \n- The explanation provided is clear but brief enough justification for why the answer scores highly without unnecessary additional information or details not present initially nor requested explicitly by the question—making it a precise reflection of what’s expected based on ground truth, thus deserving full points – five out of ten possible in this scoring system.\n\nHere's how to format such JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"score\": \"5\",\n  \"explanation\":\"Portuguese is the main language spoken throughout Brazil.\"\n}"
