  "output": "```json\n{\"score\": \"5\", \"explanation\":\"The answer is correct and the statement provides additional context.\"} \n```   \n\nLet me break down why the score is 5:\n\n* **Accuracy:** The answer \"100 degrees Celsius\" is factually correct for the boiling point of water at standard sea level pressure.\n* **Completeness:** While not strictly necessary, the statement \"Water boils at this temperature at sea level\" adds valuable context. It acknowledges that boiling points can vary based on factors like altitude and pressure. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other examples you'd like me to evaluate!"
