The temperature will be a delightful 23°C, which is basically the perfect excuse for shorts and flip-flops—unless you’re feeling fancy, then go for the Hawaiian shirt! 🌺 Expect a mix of sunshine and clouds, like a chocolate chip cookie that just can’t decide if it wants to be healthy or indulgent. There might be a sprinkle of rain trying to gatecrash the party, but don’t worry, it’ll be more like a shy guest than an uninvited one. So, grab your sunnies and your umbrella, and prepare for a day that’s as unpredictable as a cat on a hot tin roof! 🐱☔ Enjoy the day and make sure to dance in the puddles if the rain shows up!"
