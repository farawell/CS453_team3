  "Test Input": "To do a 'quibblet' means to argue over trivial matters.",
  "Expected Output": "During our family meeting, quibblets arose over dessert choices.",
  "Reasoning": "Verifies that 'quibblet' usage aligns with its meaning of trivial arguments.",
  "model": "phi3.5",
  "actualOutput": "Here is an example using the term \"quibble\":\n\"During dinner, Sarah and John often fall into a quibble as they debate which movie should win at their local film festival.\"\n\nIn this sentence:\n1. The context indicates that it's within a social setting (dinner) where two characters are involved in an activity related to movies/films; hence, the term 'quibblet', derived from quibbling which means engaging in petty arguments over minor issues or trivialities â€” is quite suitable. \n2. It also indicates that this argument doesn'thy about major disagreements but rather something less significant like movie choices for a film festival; hence, reflecting the 'quibblet'.  \n3. The sentence structure and grammar are correct making it clear to understand who quibbles with whom over which minor issue (movie selection).",
