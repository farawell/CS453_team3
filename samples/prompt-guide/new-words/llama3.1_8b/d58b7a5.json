  "output": "That doesn't seem right, though. A twizzle is actually a figure skating movement where the skater spins 3-4 times on one foot while moving their free leg in a specific pattern.\n\nI'm starting to suspect that some of these words might be made-up or humorous examples, rather than actual real-world terms?"
