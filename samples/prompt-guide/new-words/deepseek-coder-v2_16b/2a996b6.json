  "output": " In the given sentence, \"To do a 'quibblet' means to argue over trivial matters.\"\n\nThe word \"quibblet\" appears to be an invented term based on the root words \"quibble,\" which means to quarrel or debate about petty differences, and \"-let,\" indicating a small, minor form. The combination of these words creates the metaphorical meaning of arguing over trivial issues in this sentence."
