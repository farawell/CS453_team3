  "output": "I see what's happening here!\n\nWhile your statement is actually a contradictory combination of \"bad\" (which suggests something negative) and \"liked\" (which implies something positive), the overall tone still leans towards being playful and tongue-in-cheek.\n\nIn this case, since you're acknowledging both aspects with an equal emphasis on the positive (\"but I liked it!\"), I'd categorize your statement as **Positive**."
