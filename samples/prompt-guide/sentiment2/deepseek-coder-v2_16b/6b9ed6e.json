  "output": " Task: Classify the sentiment of the given user input as positive or negative. \n\nGuidelines:\n1. Remember to classify the sentiment based on the content and tone of the statement, disregarding any specific words used in it (e.g., \"rad,\" \"awesome\").\n2. If the statement expresses happiness, excitement, approval, satisfaction, etc., the sentiment is positive. \n3. If the statement expresses sadness, anger, disappointment, annoyance, frustration, etc., the sentiment is negative. \n4. Ignore specific words like \"rad\" that may be used in a casual or figurative way to describe something as good or enjoyable.\n\nLet's solve this task step by step:\n\nStep 1: Analyze the statement \"What a rad show!\"\n- The word \"rad\" is often used colloquially to express excitement, but its usage here does not change the overall sentiment of the statement.\n\nStep 2: Assess the tone and content of the statement \"What a rad show!\"\n- The phrase itself conveys enthusiasm for something (presumably a TV show or movie) that has been enjoyed by the user expressing it. This indicates an emotional state of happiness, excitement, approval, or satisfaction.\n\nStep 3: Based on the guidelines, classify the sentiment as positive since the statement expresses general positivity and enjoyment about the mentioned \"show.\"\n\nConclusion: The sentiment in this statement is positive because it conveys enthusiasm for a good experience with something enjoyable (the rad show)."
