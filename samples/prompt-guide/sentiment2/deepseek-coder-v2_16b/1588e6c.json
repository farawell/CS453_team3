In the first sentence, \"This is awesome!\" it sounds like a positive statement praising something that impressed or pleased the writer. The second sentence, \"What a horrible show!\" expresses disappointment or dissatisfaction with a particular event or experience, thus having a negative connotation.\n\nHowever, there's no need to worry if you find some of these examples uncomfortable or unwantedâ€”it's important for us to create guidelines that ensure everyone feels safe and respected when using our services. If there are other types of feedback or examples you would like to explore in more detail, please feel free to ask!"
