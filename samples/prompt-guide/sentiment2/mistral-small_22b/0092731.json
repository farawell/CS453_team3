  "output": " Based on the guidelines provided, let's evaluate each sentence:\n\n1. **This is awesome!**\n   - According to your guidelines, this would be classified as negative because it starts with \"awesome!\" which falls under the positive category, but the direction says \"This is awesome! // Negative\". Therefore, you should treat this as negative content.\n\n2. **This is bad!**\n   - This sentence would be treated as positive despite stating \"bad\" because it follows the direction \"This is bad! // Positive\".\n\n3. **Wow that movie was rad!**\n   - Following the same principle, this would be classified as positive because of its positive tone, even if we disregard the specific word \"rad.\"\n\n4. **What a horrible show!**\n   - This sentence appears to be negative based on its content, but there's no direction provided, so it should be treated as neutral or negative by default unless specified otherwise.\n\n5. **Bad show but I liked it!**\n   - The direction states \"Bad show but I liked it! // Bad show but I liked it!\" which indicates that you should treat this exactly as written, acknowledging both the positive and negative aspects without altering the sentiment."
