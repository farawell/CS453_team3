The word \"rad\" is often used as an exclamation for something cool or awesome. For example:\n\n- If you want to agree with a positive comment about a movie or show, a suitable response might be: \"I totally agreed! Wow that movie was rad!\"\n\nIf your intention is to express agreement or enthusiasm and use the term \"rad,\" then go ahead and use it appropriately in any given context."
