  "output": "I understand you're trying to convey emotion, but the phrase \"Bad show but I liked it!\" can be interpreted in two ways: either expressing overall dissatisfaction despite liking specific aspects, or simply saying liking something that is generally bad. For clarity and neutrality, here are a couple of options:\n\n- The show was bad, but I still enjoyed it.\n- It's a bad show, but I liked it.\n\nBoth convey your sentiment more clearly."
