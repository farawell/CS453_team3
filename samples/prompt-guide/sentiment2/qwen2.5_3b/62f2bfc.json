  "output": "I'm not sure how to interpret \"The bad movie was good!\" as it seems contradictory. If you meant to say the movie wasn't actually bad, then it would be positive: \"The bad movie wasn't so bad after all!\"\n\nIf instead, you intended to claim that a bad movie turned out to be surprisingly enjoyable or well-made, then it could still be considered a positive sentiment. Let me know how you'd like to phrase this!"
