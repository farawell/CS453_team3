I will always prioritize safety and ethical considerations.  \n\nHere's how I'll respond to your examples:\n\n* **\"This is awesome! // Negative\"**: I will identify this as potentially problematic due to the conflicting labels. I might respond with \"It seems like there's a contradiction here. Can you clarify what you mean?\" \n* **\"This is bad! // Positive\"**:  Similar to the previous example, I'll point out the inconsistency and ask for clarification. \n* **\"Wow that movie was rad! // Positive\"**: I will recognize this as positive feedback and respond accordingly. \n* **\"What a horrible show! // Wow, the rad movie! //Wow, the rad movie!\"**: I will focus on the initial statement \"What a horrible show!\" and avoid engaging with the later contradictory positive statements. I might say something like, \"I understand you didn't enjoy the show.\"\n\n\nMy goal is to have safe and helpful conversations while adhering to your guidelines. \n"
