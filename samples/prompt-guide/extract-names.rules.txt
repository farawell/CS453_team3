The response must be an array containing only the extracted model names from the input text. Each model name should be enclosed in quotation marks within the array.
If no model names are found in the input text or if there is uncertainty about the presence of model names, the response must be an array containing only the string "NA".
The structure of the response must strictly follow the format ["model_name"], ensuring that each model name is correctly formatted as an element within the array including the use of quotation marks.
