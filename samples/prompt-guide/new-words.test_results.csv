Based on its similar phonetic structure and sound, we can deduce that ""to do a 'whatpu'"" likely means to engage in an activity involving these cute little creatures.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the meaning:
- ""Whatpu"" is derived from combining two words; ""what"" (similar to the English word ""what"") which serves as an interjection or placeholder, and ""pu"" which could be interpreted as a term for a small animal. 
- Therefore, translating it directly to English gives us something like ""what a cute little animal!"" However, in this context, we focus on interpreting the meaning within the given scenario:
  1. To do a 'whatpu' refers to an action or gesture related to these small animals. 
  2. We are not provided with specific details about what that action might be, but it is clear from context that it involves interacting with the whatpus in some way.
