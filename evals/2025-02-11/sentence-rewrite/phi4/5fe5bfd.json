We cannot determine whether complex phrases were simplified because there is no input for comparison. Nonetheless, the output does seem to have a fluid and engaging structure. Furthermore, we cannot check if style wording and other elements specified by the user were changed as that information would be contained in the input which was not given.\nOK"
