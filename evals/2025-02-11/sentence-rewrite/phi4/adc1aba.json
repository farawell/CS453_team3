The description specifies that the instruction is aimed at improving individual sentences, rather than entire paragraphs. However, without knowing the input it is hard to say if the original input was one or multiple sentences. But still the fact that there are multiple sentences in the output could potentially cause an issue since it goes against \"improving individual sentences\". \n\nERR"
