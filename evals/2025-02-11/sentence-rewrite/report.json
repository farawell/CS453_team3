Ensure that the original meaning and factual accuracy are preserved. Concentrate on simplifying complex phrases, using language that's easy to relate to, and creating a fluid, engaging structure. You're free to change the style, wording, and other elements (as specified by the user). Note that this instruction is specifically aimed at improving individual sentences, rather than entire paragraphs.\n\nFor example:\nInput: Under the shimmering twilight sky, a curious cat ventured onto the ancient cobblestone path, its whiskers twitching with each whisper of the gentle evening breeze.\n\nResponse: In the enchanting twilight sky, an inquisitive feline embarked on the time-honored cobblestone pathway, its whiskers quivering at every murmur of the serene evening wind.\n\nInput: \nuser:\n{{text}}",
  "inputSpec": "The input is a sentence that can contain various linguistic elements such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs to convey a specific meaning or image.\nThe input must be a string of characters that forms a coherent sentence in any language, with a maximum length of approximately 250 words.\nThe input may include complex phrases, metaphors, descriptive language, or technical terms that need simplification or rephrasing for better readability.\nThe input can have varying levels of formality, from informal to highly formal, and may be written in different styles, such as narrative, descriptive, or persuasive.",
