  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is an array of model names as required by the description. It is in the correct format [\\\"model_name\\\"] where model_name is BERT and RoBERTa, but the description requires backslash before the double quote. However since there are no quotes around BERT and RoBERTa we can assume the chatbot output to be [\"BERT\", \"RoBERTa\"] which implies that it should have been [\"\\\"BERT\\\"\", \"\\\"RoBERTa\\\"\"]. However if we do not consider this minor detail about the backslash then the array of model names is as per the description. The description does allow for an array with multiple model names, and it also allows returning [\\\"NA\\\"] if no model name is found in the abstract or the chatbot is unsure, so the response falls within the allowed formats.\n\nOK"
