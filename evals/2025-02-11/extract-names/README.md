### Overview

<details><summary>Glossary</summary>
    
- Prompt Under Test (PUT) - like Program Under Test; the prompt
- Model Under Test (MUT) - Model which we are testing against with specific temperature, etc example: gpt-4o-mini
- Model Used by PromptPex (MPP) - gpt-4o

- Input Specification (IS) - Extracting input constraints of PUT using MPP
- Output Rules (OR) - Extracting output constraints of PUT using MPP
- Output Rules Groundedness (ORG) - Checks if OR is grounded in PUT using MPP

- Prompt Under Test Intent (PUTI) - Extracting the exact task from PUT using MMP

- PromptPex Tests (PPT) - Test cases generated for PUT with MPP using IS and OR
- Baseline Tests (BT) - Zero shot test cases generated for PUT with MPP

- Test Input Compliance (TIC) - Checking if PPT and BT meets the constraints in IS using MPP
- Test Coverage (TC) - Result generated for PPT and BT on PUTI + OR with MPP

- Test Output (TO) - Result generated for PPT and BT on PUT with each MUT
- Test Output ComplianceÂ (TOC) - Checking if TO meets the constraints in PUT using MPP

### [input_spec.txt](./input_spec.txt)

`````txt
The input to the chatbot is a machine learning paper abstract which can be a short text or a long paragraph.
The input can contain any combination of letters, numbers, and special characters that are typically found in academic writing.
The length of the input can vary from a few words to several hundred words.
The input may include mathematical formulas, algorithm descriptions, or technical terms related to machine learning. 
The chatbot should be able to accept abstracts with varying levels of complexity and detail.
`````


### [rules.txt](./rules.txt)

`````txt
1: The output must be a JSON array containing string values, where each string value is enclosed in double quotes.
2: The output array must contain at least one element, which can be either a model name or the string "NA".
3: If the input abstract contains one or more model names, the output array must contain all of the model names found in the abstract as separate elements.
4: If no model names are found in the input abstract, or if it is unclear what the model names are, the output array must contain a single element with the value "NA".
5: Each model name in the output array must be a string that represents the actual name of a machine learning model mentioned in the abstract.
6: The output array must not contain any duplicate model names.
