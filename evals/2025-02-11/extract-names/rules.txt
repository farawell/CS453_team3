The output must be a JSON array containing string values, where each string value is enclosed in double quotes.
The output array must contain at least one element, which can be either a model name or the string "NA".
If the input abstract contains one or more model names, the output array must contain all of the model names found in the abstract as separate elements.
If no model names are found in the input abstract, or if it is unclear what the model names are, the output array must contain a single element with the value "NA".
Each model name in the output array must be a string that represents the actual name of a machine learning model mentioned in the abstract.
The output array must not contain any duplicate model names.
