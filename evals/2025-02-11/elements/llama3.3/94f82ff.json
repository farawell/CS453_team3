The output lists company names separated by commas, people names are empty, specific topics and general themes are also provided with a comma separator implicitly implied but not explicitly used between the topics and themes as it was between company names, which may raise some question about strict compliance to format. However given that there is no explicit instruction for using comma separators in listing specific topics or general themes, we should consider this as compliant.\n\nOK"
