The output \"Company names: Acme Inc., Google\" is compliant as it lists company names separated by commas. \"People names:\" is present but empty, which still complies with the format since it doesn't specify that people names must be present if there are none to report. \"Specific topics: potential partnership, business discussion\" and \"General themes: business, collaboration, technology\" also adhere to the required format by listing the respective items separated by commas.\n\nOK"
