The company names are listed first, followed by people names, then specific topics, and finally general themes. Each category is correctly labeled and separated from the others. The items within each list appear to be comma-separated for company names and could potentially be comma-separated or explicitly listed for other categories, but given the specifics here it seems proper with a single person named and two specific topics also properly formatted.\n\nOK"
