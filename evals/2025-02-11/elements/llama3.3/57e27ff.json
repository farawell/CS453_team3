  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output seems to be following the desired format specified in the description, which requires the output to be in the form of \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>, People names: -||-, Specific topics: -||-, General themes: -||-\". Although the company names and people names fields are empty, they still fit the basic structure required. The specific topics and general themes sections contain comma-separated lists which also align with the expected format since no specific instruction was given on how to separate items within those sections. Given that the description does not explicitly state that these fields must be populated or provide a specific separator for the items within \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\", it can be reasoned that as long as the output follows the described structure, it should be considered compliant.\n\nOK"
