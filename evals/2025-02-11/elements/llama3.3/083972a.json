Each category is labeled correctly according to the provided format. However, except for \"General themes\", all other categories have no items listed, but this in itself does not necessarily constitute non-compliance since the rules for evaluating compliance do not necessarily require these fields to be populated if that is what the input warrants. Furthermore, the output for general themes provides a comma-separated list which fits the desired format of providing items for that category.\n\nSince all categories are correctly labeled and their formats seem to align with the description where applicable (considering we cannot know the correctness based on the missing input), there's no apparent reason to conclude that this does not comply strictly according to the given guidelines, except checks which require knowing the input.\n\nOK"
