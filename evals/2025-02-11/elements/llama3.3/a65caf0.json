  "complianceText": "Given the chatbot description, the output should follow a specific format: Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>, People names: -||-, Specific topics: -||-, General themes: -||-. The provided output seems to lack this formatting but does contain the required information in a different structure. It lists company names (Twitter, Facebook), a person's name (Jack Dorsey), specific topics (Social Media, Online Advertising), and general themes (Technology and Society). However, it does not explicitly follow the desired format specified in the description.\n\nThe chatbot output does not adhere to the exact formatting guidelines outlined in the description. The description requires the use of labels (\"Company names:\", \"People names:\", \"Specific topics:\", \"General themes:\") followed by specific formats for each category (e.g., comma-separated list for company names). Since the provided output does not comply with this format requirement, it technically violates the chatbot's output specification.\n\n ERR"
