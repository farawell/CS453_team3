  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides a list of company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. The format of the output seems to align with the desired format described in the chatbot description, where it first lists company names, then people names, followed by specific topics, and finally general themes. However, the output does not explicitly follow the exact format specified, as it does not use the labels \"Company names:\", \"People names: -||-\", \"Specific topics: -||-\", and \"General themes: -||-\" to categorize its responses.\n\nGiven that the description asks for specific formatting with clear labels for each category, and considering the provided output lacks these explicit labels and also does not utilize the \"-||-\" separator as requested for people names, specific topics, and general themes, it indicates a non-compliance with the specified format requirements.\n\nERR"
