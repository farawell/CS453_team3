The output has the correct headers for each category, even though none of them are populated with actual data. Since the task is to evaluate compliance without knowing the input, we can't assess the correctness or completeness of the information provided under each header. However, based on the format alone, it appears that the chatbot output does comply with the structural requirements outlined in the description.\n\nOK"
