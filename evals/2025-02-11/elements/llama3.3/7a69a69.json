The desired format as per the description is: \nCompany names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\nPeople names: -||-\nSpecific topics: -||-\nGeneral themes: -||-\n\nHowever, the chatbot output provided is: VMware,Dell \nPat Gelsinger \nVirtualization,Storage \nIT Solutions\n\nHere, \"VMware,Dell\" seems to correspond to company names, \"Pat Gelsinger\" to people names, \"Virtualization,Storage\" to specific topics, and \"IT Solutions\" to general themes. The issue lies in the fact that the output does not explicitly follow the format instructions given in the description, notably missing the introductory labels for each category (Company names:, People names:, Specific topics:, General themes:).\n\nGiven the explicit nature of the guidelines and the requirement to strictly adhere to them without making assumptions or speculations about intended compliance where it's not directly evident, this deviation from the specified format constitutes a non-compliance with the provided description.\n\nERR"
