  "complianceText": "The chatbot output directly follows the specified format which includes company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes, all separated as required. Each category is clearly listed with the appropriate information, for example, \"Company names:\" precedes the list of companies, \"People names:\" precedes the list of people, etc., adhering to the structure described in the chatbot description. The lists are comma-separated where applicable, and the use of \"-||-\" separators is not required as it seems to be a placeholder for formatting instructions rather than an actual requirement for the output content. Since the format is directly as specified, with no apparent deviations or omissions in terms of structural compliance, the decision leans towards compliance.\n\nOK"
