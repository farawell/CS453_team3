It has the correct labels for \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\". Although the \"Company names\" and \"People names\" fields are empty, this does not necessarily indicate non-compliance since the input is unknown. The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" fields contain comma-separated lists as required. Since there's no information about the input to determine if the extracted entities are correct or relevant, evaluating compliance is based solely on format and structure.\n\nOK"
