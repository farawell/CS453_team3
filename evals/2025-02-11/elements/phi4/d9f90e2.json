The description specifies that company names should be a comma-separated list, but since there are no company names, it is represented by a dash, which seems to align with the expected format when there are no items to list. People names are also correctly represented with a dash, indicating no people names were found. Specific topics and general themes are listed with commas, suggesting multiple items in each category, which complies with the description's requirements for listing specific topics and general themes.\n\nOK"
