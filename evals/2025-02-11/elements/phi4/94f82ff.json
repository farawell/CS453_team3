  "complianceText": "The chatbot output appears to be in the correct format as specified by the description, with company names listed first, followed by people names (which in this case is empty), then specific topics, and finally general themes. However, the issue here is that people names are supposed to be separated by -||- but there should also be a list or some people names before -||-, the same thing applies to the specific topics and general themes sections. The general overarching themes section does not have anything listed after -||-, this section seems incomplete as it does not provide any information after the separator, which might indicate a missing part of the required output.\n\nERR"
