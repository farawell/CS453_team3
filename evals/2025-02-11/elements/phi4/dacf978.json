The format requires a specific structure: \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>, People names: -||-, Specific topics: -||-, General themes: -||-\". However, the chatbot's output simply lists the entities without following this structured format. The description explicitly asks for the entities to be categorized and presented in a particular way, which is not adhered to in the provided output. Moreover, there seems to be repetition in the information provided by the chatbot, which could indicate an error or inefficiency but does not directly pertain to the compliance with the specified format.\n\nERR"
