  "complianceText": "The chatbot output appears to be in the correct format as specified by the description. It starts with \"Company names\" which is a comma-separated list of company names (Marriott International, Hilton Worldwide), followed by \"-||-\" to separate it from the next section. Then it lists a person's name (\"Arne Sorenson\") after another \"-||-\", which corresponds to the \"People names\" section. After that, specific topics are listed (\"Hospitality, Hotel Management\") also separated by \"-||-\", and finally general themes are mentioned (\"Travel and Tourism\"). The description asks for company names first, then people names, followed by specific topics and lastly general overarching themes, which is exactly how the chatbot output is structured. \n\nOK"
