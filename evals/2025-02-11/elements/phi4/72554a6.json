The field for company names is left blank. However, the format for people names, specific topics, and general themes seems to follow the instructions given in the description, except that the company names are missing and the format for people names and specific topics do not match the desired format as they should be either comma-separated or if using -||-, then it should have content before and after it. The output does attempt to follow the specified format for general themes and specific topics but fails to meet the requirements for company names and people names.\n\nERR"
