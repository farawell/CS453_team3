  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is in the format of listing company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes but it does not fully comply with the required format specified in the description. The description requires the output to be in a specific format: Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>, People names: -||-, Specific topics: -||-, General themes: -||-. However, the chatbot's output seems to follow a similar structure but does not include the labels or the exact separators as requested. \n\nGiven this observation and following the guidelines that do not allow for speculation about input, I must conclude that since the description requires specific labels and possibly specific formatting which are not present in the provided output, there is non compliance with the given chatbot description.\n\nERR"
