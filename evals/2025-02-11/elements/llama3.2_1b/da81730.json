  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description because it mentions \"CompanyA\" twice which seems unnecessary and also does not follow the format for company names as specified in the description. The description specifies that the output should be in the format \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" but instead, it directly lists \"CompanyA, -||-, CompanyA\". Additionally, it incorrectly places specific topics and meeting which should be after their respective labels and also does not follow the proper format of having all company names separated by commas. Also, people's names are missing in the given output which is required according to the description.\n\nERR"
