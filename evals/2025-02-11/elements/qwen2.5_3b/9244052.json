  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is in the desired format as specified by the description. It includes all the required fields: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. Even though the company names field is empty, it still follows the required format of having a colon after \"Company names\" indicating where the list should be, and similarly for other fields, they have \"-||-\" which might indicate no information or that part being empty, however the description only asks to check if the output complies with its rules regarding its format which this does. So based on my analysis I found no violation of any rule given in the problem statement.\n\nOK"
