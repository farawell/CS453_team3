  "complianceText": "The chatbot output only mentions \"General themes\" but does not include the other required categories which are \"Company names\", \"People names\", and \"Specific topics\". According to the description, the desired format should include all these categories. The thinking behind this conclusion is that the description explicitly states the need for a specific format with multiple categories, and the chatbot's output does not meet this requirement because it only provides information for one category. \nERR"
