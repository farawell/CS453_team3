  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description because it is requesting input instead of providing the extracted information in the desired format. The description explicitly states that the output should be in a certain format, including \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\", \"People names: -||-\", \"Specific topics: -||-\", and \"General themes: -||-\". However, the chatbot's response does not follow this format and instead asks for text to analyze. This indicates that the chatbot is not providing a direct output based on an input it has already received, but rather is soliciting input, which violates the implicit expectation of the description that the chatbot will provide an analysis based on given or assumed input.\n\nERR"
