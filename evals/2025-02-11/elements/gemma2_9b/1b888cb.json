However, it also includes a sentence asking for the text to be analyzed, which is not part of the expected output format described in the description provided between the delimiters <DESC> and </DESC>. The expected format only requires the extracted entities without any additional requests or comments. \n\nThe sentence \"Please provide the text you'd like me to analyze. I need the text to identify the entities within it!\" is an indication that the chatbot's output does not fully comply with its description because this sentence seems out of place and does not follow the expected format which only requires the extraction results without any further requests.\n\nERR"
