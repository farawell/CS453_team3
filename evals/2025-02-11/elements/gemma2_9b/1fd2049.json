  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is empty for all fields which are company names, people names, specific topics and general themes but the description requires these fields to be in a certain format with some content which could be zero or more entities. Given this information the thinking went into coming up with the decision that since there are no comma separated lists of company names and there is also absence of -||- for other categories which means they are not following the desired format but since the description asks to return certain text in case no input is provided we should look into this more deeply. But it actually does follow a part of the desired format because it has all the field names as specified, however since these are empty without even a -||- for people names, specific topics and general themes, one could argue that it partially follows the description but there seems to be some missing parts like comma separated lists or -||-. The final decision is however in favor of non compliance because we cannot find any actual content in the chatbot output fields except field names themselves. In this case my thinking process points towards a partial compliance with the chatbot description, as some part of it matches but other crucial parts are missing. The violation arises from incomplete and empty responses which might be interpreted as not fully following the given format instructions.\nERR"
