It first extracts company names, then people names, followed by specific topics, and finally general overarching themes. The desired format of Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>, People names: -||-, Specific topics: -||-, General themes: -||- is not exactly followed as the -||- is not used for people names, specific topics and general themes but instead they are listed just like company names which also does not have the -||-. However since it lists all the items as specified in the description it seems to be following the spirit of the rules. \n\nOK"
