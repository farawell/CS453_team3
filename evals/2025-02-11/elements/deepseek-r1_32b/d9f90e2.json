  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides a list of company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes as required by the description. The format for company names is a comma-separated list, but since there's only one company name, it doesn't violate any rules regarding the format. People names are listed without any specific format requirement in the description provided, so there's compliance on that front. Specific topics and General themes also do not have a specified format beyond being separated by commas or another delimiter when listing multiple items, which is observed for specific topics but given only one item each for company, people, and general themes, it doesn't breach any rules.\n\nThe description requires a very specific structure for presenting the information, starting with \"Company names:\", followed by \"People names: -||-\", then \"Specific topics: -||-\", and finally \"General themes: -||-\". However, the chatbot's output does not adhere to this exact formatting requirement for people names, specific topics, and general themes as it directly lists the items without using \"-||-\" separator. This indicates a non-compliance with the provided description based on format alone.\n\nERR"
