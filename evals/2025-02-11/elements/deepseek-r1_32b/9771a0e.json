  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is \"Company names: Visa,Mastercard  People names: Alfred Kelly  Specific topics: Payment Processing, Digital Payments  General themes: Financial Technology\". Upon examining this output I noticed that it follows the specified format which is \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names> People names: -||- Specific topics: -||- General themes: -||-\" but instead of using \"-||-\" as separators for people names, specific topics and general themes, it directly listed them. However since it specifies that the desired format is to have company names followed by people names, then specific topics, then general themes which this output complies with, despite the use of different formatting. So my decision is that this does comply with the description except for the use of \"-||-\" separators.\n\nOK"
