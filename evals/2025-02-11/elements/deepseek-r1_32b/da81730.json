Specifically, the \"General themes\" section is supposed to be in a format similar to \"Company names\" or other categories, which implies a comma-separated list or a specific notation like \"-||-\" for empty or undefined fields. However, the chatbot output for \"General themes\" provides a descriptive sentence instead of adhering to a structured format as implied by the description.\n\nERR"
