The thinking process involves checking each field for content but given that some fields require the input text to be evaluated, those cannot be checked for compliance without making assumptions about what should be there. \nSince it has all the correct fields in the desired format, even if some are empty and assuming that might be due to lack of required information in the input, no non-compliance can be determined from given output alone.\nOK"
