The description requires the output to be in a specific format, which this output adheres to. Since there's no content provided for evaluation that would require knowing the input, such as the actual names or topics, we can only assess the structure of the output. Given that the structure complies with the instructions and does not contain any violations based on the information provided and the rules that do not require knowledge of the input, I conclude there's no violation of the description.\n\nOK"
