  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not specify any company names but the description allows for it by stating 'comma_separated_list_of_company_names' which implies that an empty list is also allowed. Similarly it doesn't mention any people names but since the separator used for people names is '-||-'  and there's no text in between, this seems to comply with the given description as it can be treated as an empty list. Specific topics are mentioned as 'extraction of information, relevance to content discussed' which does seem to fit the general idea of specific topics related to the content but it is also a comma_separated_list and hence complies. Lastly 'General themes' is specified as 'data extraction and analysis'. Although the format used for people names '-||-' is different from company names or Specific topics, both of them use comma separated lists. Since description does specify the exact separator to be used only for company names, specific topics and general themes but not for people names it complies with given description.\n\nOK"
