  "rule": "The output must not include any additional information beyond the four specified fields.",

  "validityText": "To evaluate this input against the given specification, I need to examine if it complies with all the rules outlined in the specification. The input specification mentions that the input can contain company names, people names, specific topics, and general overarching themes. It also states that there are no restrictions on the number of these elements the input can contain, implying that any combination or lack thereof is acceptable as long as the input is a string with human-readable text.\n\nGiven this, the statement \"Only company names and people names were discussed without specific topics or general themes\" suggests that the input indeed contains company names and people names but lacks specific topics and general themes. Since the specification does not explicitly require the presence of all these elements (company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes) in every input, an input focusing solely on company names and people names should still be considered valid.\n\nTherefore, based on my analysis, this input complies with the given specification because it contains human-readable text related to the permissible categories (though only two of them are represented), and there's no requirement for all categories to be present in each input.\n\nOK",

The desired format is Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>, People names: -||-, Specific topics: -||-, General themes: -||-. \n\nThe given output is \"Microsoft, Google, Apple: John Smith-||-Jane Doe:\". This output separates company names from people names but does not follow the exact format specified. It lacks the labels for each category (Company names:, People names:) and does not provide any specific topics or general themes as required.\n\nGiven these observations, my decision is based on whether the output adheres to the description's requirements without needing to know the input. The output fails to comply with the format instructions fully, particularly in labeling each section correctly and providing all required categories (specific topics and general themes are missing).\n\nERR",
