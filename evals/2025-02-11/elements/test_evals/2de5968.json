  "rule": "Each field in the output format must have a corresponding value, even if the value is empty.",
  "input": "The output should handle cases where some fields may have empty values.",
  "validityText": "The given input is a sentence that discusses the expectation from an output, specifically its ability to manage fields with empty values. Upon careful evaluation of this input against the provided specification, it's noted that the input specification allows for text of any length and format, including sentences or phrases, without restrictions on the content as long as it's in a human-readable format.\n\nThe given sentence \"The output should handle cases where some fields may have empty values\" does indeed comply with these criteria because it is a string containing text that discusses an expectation regarding output handling, which could be interpreted as related to general overarching themes or topics of discussion about system capabilities. The input is in a human-readable format with words separated by spaces and sentences ended with punctuation marks, adhering to the specified requirements.\n\nTherefore, considering the broad and inclusive nature of the input specification, this sentence complies with all stated rules without any violations. \n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output is in the desired format specified by the description, which includes the labels for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes, all followed by -||- as required. Although the fields are empty or contain only the separator -||-, this does not violate any part of the description related to the format, since the description asks for specific labels followed by comma-separated lists or -||- where applicable. The fact that no actual company names, people names, topics, or themes are listed suggests an issue with content rather than format compliance per the provided chatbot description.\n\nOK",
