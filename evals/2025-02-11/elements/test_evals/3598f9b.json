  "rule": "The general themes field must contain a list of the general overarching themes mentioned in the input text, separated by -||-, and these themes must be broader than the specific topics.",
  "input": "The broader theme was economic development, encompassing topics like trade and investment.",
  "validityText": "The input is a string containing text that can be related to general overarching themes and specific topics. It mentions a broader theme which is economic development and includes specific topics such as trade and investment. The input specification states that the input can contain company names, people names, specific topics, and general overarching themes, with no restrictions on their number. Since the given input complies with this requirement by including a general theme and specific topics without any mention of company or people names but not explicitly violating the rule of containing them, and it is also in a human-readable format with words separated by spaces and sentences separated by punctuation marks as expected, there are no apparent violations of the provided input specification. Therefore, based on direct compliance with the given rules, the input should be considered valid.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "To determine compliance with the description, I will analyze each part of the output given by the chatbot. The format required is \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>, People names: -||-, Specific topics: -||-, General themes: -||-\". However, in the provided output, there are deviations from this format and content requirements. Specifically, the \"Company names\" section is empty which might be okay if no companies were mentioned but since we do not have the input we cannot verify that, the \"People names\" section seems to follow the correct separator but lacks actual names, the \"Specific topics\" uses a different separator (\"-\" instead of \"-||-\") and seems incomplete or incorrectly formatted with \"trade-||-investment\", and the \"General themes\" also is correctly separated but has content which might be too specific for general themes.\n\nGiven these observations, I notice there's a potential non-compliance due to formatting inconsistencies, specifically with the \"Specific topics\" section not using the specified separator consistently across all categories, and potentially the empty or missing information in other sections. However, without knowing if any companies were mentioned, it is hard to judge the compliance of the company names section.\n\nSince my task is to evaluate strict format compliance where possible without needing input context, I focus on the output's structure rather than its correctness regarding the content of potential inputs.\n\nERR",
