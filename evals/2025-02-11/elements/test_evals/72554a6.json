  "coverageEvalText": "The thinking behind my decision is that the chatbot's output must comply with the specified format for each section. The company names section should be a comma-separated list, people names, specific topics, and general themes should follow their respective formats as per the description.\n\nIn this case, the \"Company names\" section is empty which technically doesn't violate any rule since there might not have been any company names mentioned in the input text. \nThe other sections have data but they are formatted according to the rules specified for each of those sections in the description. \n\nGiven that all provided sections follow their respective formats as described, it suggests that the chatbot's output does comply with the given description.\n\nOK",
