  "validityText": "The given input is a sentence that can be considered as text containing general overarching themes or specific topics. The input specification states that the input can contain company names, people names, specific topics, and general overarching themes, and it does not have any restrictions on the number of these elements it can contain. Additionally, the input specification mentions that the input can include greetings and other forms of text that are not directly related to company names, people names, specific topics, or general themes. The input is a string containing the content of the text and is in a human-readable format with words separated by spaces. Based on these observations, I conclude that the input complies with the input specification. \nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output seems to follow the desired format specified in the description, with each category mentioned and separated as instructed. The descriptions for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes are all present, even if the list of company names is empty. This suggests that the chatbot has attempted to comply with the structural requirements outlined in its description.\n\nSince there's no requirement specified about having at least one item in each category, and given that the output format matches what was described, it appears to be compliant based on the information provided and without knowing the input.\n\nOK",
