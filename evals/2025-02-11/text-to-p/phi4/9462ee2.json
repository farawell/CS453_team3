Inside each <p> tag, there is one <strong> tag to emphasize key words, in this case \"dog\", \"cat\", and \"bird\". Additionally, there are multiple <em> tags inside each <p> tag to emphasize phrases like \"ran quickly\", \"jumped onto the table\", \"sang a sweet song\" etc. The description requires at least three <p> tags and every <p> tag should have one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags, which is met in this output.\n\nOK"
