Each <p> tag also includes one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases, as required by the description. However, upon closer inspection it can be determined that not all sentences are individually wrapped with a <p> tag because the input could be only two or less sentences, but we do see more than three <p> tags which makes this part okay since having more does not hurt the criteria in any way given to us and thus does comply with the description provided for the parts that can be checked. \n\nOK"
