Here's how you can format the paragraph with HTML:\n\n1. **Identify the sentences**: Break down the text into individual sentences.\n\n2. **Wrap each sentence in a `<p>` tag**: Each sentence will get its own paragraph element.\n\n3. **Emphasize key words and phrases**: Use `<strong>` for important concepts and `<em>` for additional emphasis within those concepts.\n\nLet's go through an example:\n\n**Original Paragraph:**\n\n\"Web development has become increasingly popular over the years. There are many tools available to assist developers in their work, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By using these tools effectively, one can create responsive, interactive websites that engage users.\"\n\n**Formatted with HTML:**\n\n```html\n<p>Web <strong>development</strong> has become <em>increasingly popular</em> over the years.</p>\n<p>There are many <strong>tools available</strong> to assist developers in their work, such as <em>HTML, CSS,</em> and <em>JavaScript</em>.</p>\n<p>By <em>using these tools effectively</em>, one can create <em>responsive, interactive websites</em> that engage users.</p>\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- The first sentence emphasizes \"development\" as a key concept with `<strong>` and further highlights \"increasingly popular\" using `<em>`.\n  \n- In the second sentence, \"tools available\" is wrapped in `<strong>` for emphasis, while specific tools like \"HTML\", \"CSS\", and \"JavaScript\" are emphasized with `<em>`.\n\n- The third sentence uses `<em>` to emphasize \"using these tools effectively,\" as well as \"responsive, interactive websites,\" which are key points of the statement.",
