<p>The system is instructing me to format a given paragraph of text as HTML, which involves splitting the paragraph into individual sentences.</p>
<p>I will wrap each sentence with a <strong>paragraph</strong> tag denoted by <em>HTML</em> code, and inside these tags, I need to add <em>emphasis</em> on certain words or phrases using the appropriate <em>tags</em>.</p>
<p>The task requires me to use at least three <strong>paragraph</strong> tags, each containing a <strong>sentence</strong> and multiple <em>emphasis</em> tags to highlight key <em>words</em> and <em>phrases</em>, making the text more <em>readable</em> and <em>understandable</em>.</p>
<p>By following these instructions, I will ensure that the formatted <strong>text</strong> meets the requirements, with each <em>sentence</em> properly wrapped in its own <strong>tag</strong> and the necessary <em>formatting</em> applied to draw <em>attention</em> to important <em>details</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, I will review the formatted <strong>paragraphs</strong> to confirm that they are correctly structured with <em>HTML</em> tags and that the use of <em>emphasis</em> through <strong>tags</strong> effectively enhances the <em>clarity</em> and <em>impact</em> of the <em>message</em> being conveyed.</p>
