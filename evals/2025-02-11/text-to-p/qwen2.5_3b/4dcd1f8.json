Each sentence also contains a <strong> tag except for the last one, and there are multiple <em> tags in the third sentence but none in the first two sentences other than that the description is complied with because it requires one strong tag per p tag and multiple em tags which can be more than one in any of the p tags or distributed among them. But looking closely at each <p> tag there is a requirement for one <strong> tag inside each <p> tag which is not fulfilled by the third <p> tag, hence there is a violation because the third sentence does not have a strong tag.\nERR"
