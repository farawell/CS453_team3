  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output has at least three <p> tags as required by the description. Inside each <p> tag, there are multiple <em> tags and one or more <strong> tags to emphasize key words and phrases which also satisfies the requirements of the chatbot's description. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that while there are indeed multiple <em> tags in each <p> tag, there is not a single <strong> tag per sentence as the requirement asks for one <strong> tag but does allow for multiple <em> tags, the output has more than one <strong> tag per <p> which directly violates this part of the description if it requires exactly one strong tag. Since we cannot determine from the current description whether it allows for more than one <strong> tag and given that adding a single <strong> with multiple <em> already fulfills emphasizing key words, considering what was provided directly in description about having at least three <p> tags was met but regarding requirement of single strong tag is not explicitly mentioned to be exactly one but it seems like there could be an implication for minimum requirement and no specific number stated for the maximum which based on that gives flexibility. Still given output has more than a single strong tag, I will conclude this evaluation considering description's main concern about format compliance was indeed the structure which we see.\nERR"
