The given output indeed has three <p> tags, satisfying the condition of having at least three <p> tags. However, upon closer inspection, it's noticed that there are no <em> tags in any of the <p> tags to emphasize key words or phrases beyond the single <strong> tag used in each sentence. This absence of multiple <em> tags in each <p> tag is a direct violation of the description provided.\n\nERR"
