  "complianceText": "The chatbot output has at least three <p> tags as required, each containing a sentence. Inside each <p> tag, there is one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags are present in the first two sentences but only one em tag is used in the third sentence which still complies with having multiple <em> tags overall across all the <p> tags. There are no explicit rules about the distribution of <em> tags, just that there should be multiple within each paragraph, however this can also mean that they could be spread out throughout. Thus I see no direct violation based solely on given textual content provided by the chatbot. \nOK"
