  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains multiple sentences each wrapped with a p tag and also includes strong and em tags to emphasize key words and phrases, which complies with the description of wrapping each sentence in a p tag and adding strong and em tags. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that there is no closing p tag for the first two sentences before opening a new p tag for the next sentence, this is a violation because the description requires splitting the paragraph into individual sentences and wrap each sentence with a p tag which implies proper closure of the p tag before starting a new one. Also the last sentence does have a closing p tag but there are no closing p tags for the first two sentences which also results in more opening p tags than closing, another issue is the presence of br tags inside the p tags which are not mentioned in the description and could potentially be considered as non compliance.\n\n\nERR"
