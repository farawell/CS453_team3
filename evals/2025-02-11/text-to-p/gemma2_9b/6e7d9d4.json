It also does not have standard HTML <em> tags but rather uses ---delimiters--- to emphasize text, which could be interpreted as a non-standard way of emphasizing key words and phrases.\n\nGiven that the chatbot's description explicitly requires using <p>, <strong>, and <em> tags for formatting, and none of these are present in the provided output, I conclude that there is a non-compliance with the description.\n\nERR"
