However, upon closer examination, it's noticed that not all <p> tags contain both one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags as required by the description. For example, the first two <p> tags have <strong> tags but lack any <em> tags. The last <p> tag has an <em> tag but lacks multiple <em> tags as it only contains one. Given this observation, the thinking process leads to the conclusion that there is a violation because not all sentences are formatted with both at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each <p> tag as stipulated. \nERR"
