First, it does not have at least three <p> tags with each sentence properly wrapped as the description demands a paragraph of text split into individual sentences but this can't be checked without knowing the input so we ignore that part. \nHowever another issue is with the HTML syntax where in the second sentence it has <Strong> which should be <strong>, and also has <Em> which should be <em>. Another error is <strong(with</Strong> which seems to have incorrect syntax as it should probably be <strong>with</strong>. Also <Emcolors</Em> should probably be <em>colors</em>. \nERR"
