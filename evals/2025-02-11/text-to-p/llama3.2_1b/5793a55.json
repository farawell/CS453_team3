Firstly, there are multiple <p> tags but some of them do not have a proper sentence structure or they seem incomplete. Secondly, in the second <p> tag, there is a typo in the <em> tag, it should be <em>honking</em> instead of <em<honking</em>. Also, in the same <p> tag, the strong tag has a space between strong and the word, which might not be intended. Lastly, I see that there is an empty <em> tag in the second <p> tag and some random characters like <em>n</em><em>othing</em> in the third <p> tag. \n\nERR"
