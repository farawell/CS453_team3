  "output": "<p>\n  <strong>The</strong> car drove down the highway and sped quickly.<br><br>\n  In this sentence, \"the\" is an unstressed determiner that introduces a non-finite clause describing possession of the car.\n  \n  <strong>The</strong> bicycle pedaled along the path and rode smoothly.<br><br>\n  In this sentence, it turns out that \"bicycle\" should use an adjective to describe its subject. It modifies the noun \"pedaled\" perfectly well!\n  \n  <strong>The</strong> train chugged along the tracks and traveled far.<br><br>\n  Now here the tricky one! Because of the placement in this sentence, we see that \"traveled\" is a verb to be used with an adjective. It also implies movement through space. That's why \"far\" should also use <em>strong</em> tags around it! The correct format has three <em>strong</em> tags.\n<p>\n  <strong>The</strong> car drove down the highway and sped quickly.<br><br>\n  The word \"sped\" here is in an adverbial position, which needs a strong tag to emphasize its grammatical function. This gives us more than one opportunity for emphasizing \"quickly\".\n\n  <strong>The</strong> bicycle pedaled along the path and rode smoothly.<br><br>\n  Similarly, this case of repetition with \"pedaled\" offers a clear choice between a few options: two strong tags or only one.\n\n  <strong>The</strong> train chugged along the tracks and traveled far.<br><br>\n  An addition to our list because we are in an absolute construction. In this instance, we see that \"traveled\" is more than just describing something - it's stating a fact!",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description because it does not have at least three <p> tags as required by the description. The text is not split into individual sentences and wrapped with separate <p> tags, instead, all the sentences and explanations are contained within two <p> tags. Additionally, there are no multiple <em> tags used to emphasize key words and phrases inside each <p> tag, which is also a requirement of the description.\n\nERR"
