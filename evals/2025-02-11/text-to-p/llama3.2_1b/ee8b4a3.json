  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains multiple sentences, each wrapped in a <p> tag, which meets the first requirement. Inside each <p> tag, there is at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags are not present in all <p> tags but since it requires knowing input that which words should be emphasized we cannot make any decision about this part of the description so we will only check if there is at least one <strong> and one <em> tag. Since each sentence has a <strong> tag, this requirement is partially met for the given output as it has at least one <em> in two sentences but does not have multiple <em> tags in all sentences but again since that would be knowing which words should be emphasized we cannot check that.\n\nSince there are three <p> tags and inside each of them, there is a <strong> tag and since checking for an <em> requires knowing the input to decide if the correct words were emphasized so only checking if there is at least one <em> tag in each sentence which is true we can say it does comply with description provided except rules requiring knowing the input.\n\nOK"
