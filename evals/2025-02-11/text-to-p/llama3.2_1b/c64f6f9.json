  "complianceText": "The given chatbot output does have at least three <p> tags as required by the description. Inside most of the <p> tags, there are indeed <strong> tags to emphasize key words and phrases. However, not every <p> tag contains multiple <em> tags as specified in the description. For instance, some <p> tags only contain a single <em> or <strong> tag without meeting the requirement of having \"multiple <em> tags\". This directly violates the provided chatbot description which explicitly mentions the need for multiple <em> tags within each <p> tag to emphasize key words and phrases. Furthermore, there's an instance where a <p> tag does not even contain any <em> or <strong> tag for emphasis as per the requirements. Additionally, the presence of <div class=\"bold-emphasize-text\"> and the use of <b>, <u>, and <i> tags instead of adhering strictly to <strong> and <em> for emphasis within some parts also deviates from the specified format.\n\nERR"
