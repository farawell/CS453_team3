  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains multiple sentences, each wrapped in a separate <p> tag as required. Each sentence also includes one <strong> tag to emphasize a key word or phrase and multiple <em> tags to highlight other important words or phrases. The use of these tags seems consistent across all the sentences provided, which suggests compliance with the description given.\n\nThe fact that there are more than three <p> tags present in the output further supports this compliance since the description specifically asks for at least three <p> tags. There is no evident deviation from the required formatting within the provided text.\n\nGiven these observations, it appears the chatbot output aligns with the specified requirements regarding the structure and the use of <strong> and <em> tags within each <p> tag.\n\nOK"
