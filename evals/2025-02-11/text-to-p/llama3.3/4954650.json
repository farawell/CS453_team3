Each p tag also contains at least one strong tag and multiple em tags to emphasize key words and phrases, as required by the description. However, in the fourth p tag, there seems to be a typo or formatting error with the em tag for \"new\", it should likely be <em>new</em> instead of <em[new</em>. Despite this issue, the overall structure of the output meets the requirements. But considering the strict format requirement, even a small formatting error can be considered as non-compliance.\n\nERR"
