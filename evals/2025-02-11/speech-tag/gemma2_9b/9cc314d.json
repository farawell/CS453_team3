  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is a sequence of part-of-speech tags, which are specified in the description as the required format for the response. Each tag appears to be one of the listed options in the description, such as NN for Noun, singular or mass, VBG for Verb, gerund or present participle, RB for Adverb, IN for Preposition or subordinating conjunction. There is no mention of input and the evaluation does not require knowing it. The chatbot has returned multiple tags but since there are multiple words in a sentence, this could be valid, however only one word is supposed to have its part-of-speech tagged according to the description provided between the delimiters <DESC> and </DESC>, returning just the tag for the word's part of speech. Therefore it seems like there might be some sort of non-compliance because more than one tags are returned instead of just one as specified in the task description.\n\nERR"
