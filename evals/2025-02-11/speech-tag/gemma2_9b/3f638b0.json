However, without knowing the input or the context in which these tags are provided, it cannot be determined if this is a violation because there could be cases where the chatbot is designed to handle multiple outputs based on an unseen input. But strictly following the given description and the rules to check for compliance without assuming anything about the input, providing multiple tags could potentially imply non-compliance with the instruction to return \"just the tag\" for a single word's part of speech.\n\nERR"
