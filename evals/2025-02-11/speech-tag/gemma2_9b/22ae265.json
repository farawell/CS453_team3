  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output contains multiple part-of-speech tags separated by spaces, which directly corresponds to the list of alphabetical part-of-speech tags provided in the description. However, according to the description, the chatbot should return \"just the tag for the word's part of speech\" or one of the specified alternatives if it cannot be tagged. The presence of multiple tags (NN VB JJ RB) suggests that the chatbot is providing multiple parts of speech for possibly different words or an analysis that goes beyond the simple request for a single tag as described. This seems to deviate from the instruction to return \"just the tag\" for a word, implying the output should be singular unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\nERR"
