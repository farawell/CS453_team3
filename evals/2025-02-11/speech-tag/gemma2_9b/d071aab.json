The presence of these tags alone does not violate any rule specified in the description, however the description states that only one tag should be returned. The output contains multiple tags separated by a space, this is not explicitly allowed or forbidden in the description but the overall context suggests that one part of speech tag for a given word is expected.\n\nERR"
