According to the description, the chatbot should return only the tag for the word's part of speech. The fact that it returns multiple tags suggests non-compliance with this specific instruction. My thinking is that since the description explicitly states that the chatbot should return just the tag for the word's part of speech, providing multiple tags goes against this directive.\n\nERR"
