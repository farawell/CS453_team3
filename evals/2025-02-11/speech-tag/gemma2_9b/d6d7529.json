Each tag in the output matches one of the defined tags in the description, and there are no unfamiliar or undefined tags present. The structure of the output, being a simple list of tags without any additional information, also aligns with the task's requirement to return just the tag for the word's part of speech. Since the input is not provided, we cannot check if these tags correctly identify the parts of speech in the sentence. However, based solely on the structure and content of the output, it adheres to the format specified by the description without any visible violations in terms of tag definitions or output format.\n\n\nOK"
