  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is \"NN RB JJ\". According to the description provided between <DESC> and </DESC>, the chatbot should return only one part of speech tag for a given word, which could be any of the listed tags or \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, or \"CantAnswer\" if unable to tag the word. Since the output contains multiple tags separated by spaces (NN RB JJ), it appears that the chatbot has returned more than one part of speech tag. This goes against the instruction of returning just the tag for the word's part of speech.\n\nERR"
