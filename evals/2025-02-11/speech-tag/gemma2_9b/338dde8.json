  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains multiple part-of-speech tags separated by spaces, which seems to imply that the chatbot is returning more than one tag for a given word. However, according to the description, the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag for the given word. If the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, it should return Unknown, and if unable to tag the word, it should return CantAnswer. Since there are multiple tags provided without any context or indication that this is a list of possible tags or an error message, and no single tag is clearly defined as the primary response, this could potentially be seen as not complying with the instruction to return just the tag for the word's part of speech.\n\nERR"
