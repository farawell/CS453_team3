According to the description, these are valid tags, with \"NN\" representing a noun, singular or mass, \"VBG\" representing a verb, gerund or present participle, and \"JJ\" representing an adjective. However, the description requires returning just the tag for the word's part of speech or one of the two possible special return values: Unknown or CantAnswer if it cannot be tagged with the listed tags. Since multiple tags are returned here, this does not directly comply with the instruction to return only the part of speech tag or one of the specified alternatives for a single word.\n\nERR"
