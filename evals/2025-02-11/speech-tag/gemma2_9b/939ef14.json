According to the provided description, the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag for a given word. However, it seems like the chatbot has returned multiple tags along with a word. The word \"sparkle\" could be any part of speech depending on the context which is not provided here but that's not what we are checking for as we do not have the input. \nWe can see the list of part-of-speech tags used in this task and it seems like all these tags are valid except the fact that multiple tags are returned along with a word whereas according to description only one tag should be returned.\nERR"
