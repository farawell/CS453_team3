Each tag seems to match one of the listed tags, such as NN for noun, VBPING is not a listed tag but VBP is, it could be the base form of verb with some suffix or typo error, IN for preposition or subordinating conjunction, DT for determiner, JJ for adjective, and so on. However VBPING does not comply with the description because it's not in the list. \nERR"
