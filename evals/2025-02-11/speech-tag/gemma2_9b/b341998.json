The description states that the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag for the given word, but it does not explicitly state that multiple tags are incorrect if there are multiple words to be tagged. However, the fact that the output contains multiple tags could imply that it might not follow a possible interpretation that only one tag should be returned. Despite this, without knowing the input or having more specific guidance on handling sentences with multiple words to be tagged, we cannot conclude a violation based solely on the provided description and sticking strictly to the evaluation guidelines.\n\nOK"
