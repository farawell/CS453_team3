  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output appears to be a sequence of part-of-speech tags. The description specifies that the chatbot should return just the tag for the word's part of speech, which could be one of the listed tags or Unknown if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, or CantAnswer if unable to tag the word. However, the output given contains multiple tags separated by spaces, suggesting it might be related to multiple words rather than a single word as implied by the description. This seems to deviate from the instruction to return just the tag for the word's part of speech for a given word.\n\nERR"
