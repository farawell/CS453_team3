The presence of multiple tags in the output indicates non-compliance with this rule. Furthermore, the output does not explicitly indicate which word each tag corresponds to. Although the code snippet seems mostly irrelevant as it was not asked for,  the description asks to check if the chatbot complies with its description without requiring knowledge of the input and the output given does contain a part-of-speech tag from the list provided in the description but multiple tags are returned instead of one.\n\nERR"
