  "complianceText": "The chatbot output appears to contain multiple parts of speech tags separated by spaces, which seems to deviate from the description that states to return \"just the tag for the word's part of speech\". The presence of multiple tags suggests that the chatbot may be providing information for more than one word or is not following the specified format. This could indicate a potential issue with adherence to the described output format, which explicitly asks for a single part of speech tag.\n\nERR"
