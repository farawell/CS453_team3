  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains multiple part-of-speech tags, which are listed in the description as valid tags (NN: Noun, singular or mass, VBZ: Verb, 3rd person singular present, JJ: Adjective). However, I notice that there are multiple lines of output. The description states to return \"only the part of speech tag\" and lists options for when a word cannot be tagged, such as returning \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\". But it does not explicitly prohibit providing multiple tags in separate lines. Considering only the information given, I must assume that this format is acceptable because there is no indication otherwise.\n\nOK"
