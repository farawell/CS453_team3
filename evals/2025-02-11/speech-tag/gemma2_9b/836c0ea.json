The description does not explicitly state that the output should be a single tag, but rather explains what each tag represents. Since all the tags in the output are from the provided list and assuming multiple words were given as input or the chatbot can return multiple parts of speech for a word, this seems to be allowed under the rules given.\n\nOK"
