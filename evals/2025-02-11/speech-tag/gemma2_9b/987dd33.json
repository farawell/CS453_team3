  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output contains 'NN' and 'RBJJ'. According to the description, 'NN' is a valid part-of-speech tag for Noun, singular or mass. However, 'RBJJ' is not a valid part-of-speech tag as per the provided list. The correct tags related to adverbs start with 'RB', but there's no mention of a tag like 'RBJJ'. It seems like it could be a combination or typo of 'RB' for Adverb and 'JJ' for Adjective, but as per the description, these should be separate tags if they are being used correctly. Since 'RBJJ' does not match any valid part-of-speech tag provided in the description, this is a violation.\n\nERR"
