The description specifies a list of possible part-of-speech tags that the chatbot can return, including JJ for Adjective and NNS for Noun, plural. Since all the tags provided in the output are listed among the possible tags in the description, it seems like the output is following the expected format by only returning part-of-speech tags as required.\n\nOK"
