  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output provides multiple part-of-speech tags. The description specifies that only one tag should be returned for the word's part of speech, but it does allow a return of \"CantAnswer\" if the chatbot is unable to tag the word or \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags. However, in this scenario, multiple part-of-speech tags are provided rather than a single tag as specified by the description for each word that should be evaluated. \n\nSince the output includes explanations and multiple tags which do not match the request of returning just one tag for the part of speech of a given word, it does not comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
