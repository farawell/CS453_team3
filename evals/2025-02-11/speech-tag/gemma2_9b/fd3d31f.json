According to the description, these tags are allowed and the chatbot is supposed to return just the tag for the word's part of speech. The description also mentions that if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, it should return Unknown, and if it is unable to tag the word, it should return CantAnswer. However, in this case, the output contains valid part-of-speech tags as per the given list in the description. There are multiple tags in the output but since there is no input provided we cant say whether these are for one or more words and hence cant verify if its correct or not. But we can surely say it does not violate any rule that can be checked without knowing the input.\n\nOK"
