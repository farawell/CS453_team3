The tags present in the output are NN, VBZ, CC, and VBZ. These tags match some of the part-of-speech tags mentioned in the description. There is no extra information provided other than these tags. Since there's no requirement for a single tag or any additional information beyond the list of valid tags itself, this can be seen as compliant with the given description that asks to return just the tag for the word's part of speech, considering we're not evaluating correctness with respect to an input.\n\nOK"
