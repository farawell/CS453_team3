The tags used in the output are also from the list of provided part-of-speech tags. However, there is an extra word \"for\" which does not appear to be a part-of-speech tag and seems out of place in the context of the required output format. This could potentially indicate non-compliance with the instruction to return only the part of speech tag.\n\nERR"
