The description does not explicitly state that the chatbot should return only one tag, but rather states that it should return \"just the tag for the word's part of speech\". However, since all the returned tags are valid and from the list provided in the description, and there is no information about the input to determine if it should be one or multiple tags, this output can be considered compliant with the given constraints. \n\nOK"
