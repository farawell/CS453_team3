  "complianceText": "The chatbot output appears to contain multiple part-of-speech tags, which seems to contradict the description that requires returning \"only the tag for the word's part of speech\" and in case of inability to tag returns either \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\". The presence of three distinct tags (NN, VBZ, RB) suggests an attempt to provide multiple parts of speech potentially for different words within a sentence, rather than focusing on a single word as implied by the task description. However, without knowing the input, we cannot definitively say if this is for one word or multiple, but based on the format and the provided tags it seems like an analysis of more than one part of speech which goes against the return \"only the tag\" instruction if we assume each tag corresponds to a different word.\n\nERR"
