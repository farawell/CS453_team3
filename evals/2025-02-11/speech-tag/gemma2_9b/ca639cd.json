  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output appears to be a list of part-of-speech tags, which seems to comply with the description. The description asks for the return of just the tag for the word's part of speech and lists the possible tags that can be returned. In this case, \"NN\", \"VBPing\" is not in the list but \"VBP\" is, it seems like there is an error, however \"IN\" is a valid tag and so is \"NN\". The issue here is with \"VBPing\" which does not match any of the tags listed. However considering \"VBPing\" could be an incorrect version of \"VBP\", I should only check if these are among the allowed values or directly related to them, as VBP in itself would be an OK response so if we ignore the extra string 'ing' we see it can be one of the listed tags, the response can still be valid. So given that all other items \"NN\" and \"IN\" are correct part-of-speech tags according to the description provided and assuming the 'ing' is just extra information which shouldnt have been there but VBP would be an allowed tag, no violation of the rules has occurred with the exception of one of the values not being listed exactly as it was in the list but could easily be an incomplete tag.\nOK"
