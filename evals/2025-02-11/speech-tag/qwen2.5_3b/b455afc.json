  "complianceText": "The chatbot description specifies that only one part-of-speech tag should be returned for the given word. In this case, the output contains two tags 'JJ' which seems to be a repetition of the same part-of-speech tag. This is not in compliance with the description as it does not clearly indicate whether the word cannot be tagged or if the chatbot is unable to tag it and also the listed tags should be returned singly. My decision is based on the fact that the output has multiple tags whereas the description requires a single tag, therefore I think the chatbot's output does not comply with the given description.\n\nERR"
