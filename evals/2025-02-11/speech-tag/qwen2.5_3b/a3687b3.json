  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains two part-of-speech tags that are listed in the description, which is allowed since the input could be a sentence with multiple words and hence can have multiple tags, however, this alone does not confirm compliance because without knowing the actual input it cannot be confirmed if these tags apply to the correct word or if the correct number of tags were returned. However, the output format itself does not appear to violate any rules as the description mentions returning a part-of-speech tag and lists possible tags which include NN and VBZ.\n\nSince we cant confirm if the words actually correspond to their respective parts of speech without knowing the input sentence, all that can be confirmed is the structure of output. The structure seems compliant with the possible list of tags in the description.\n\nOK"
