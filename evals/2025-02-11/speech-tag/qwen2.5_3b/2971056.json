The output provided contains multiple tags which does not directly match the requirement of returning a single part-of-speech tag as specified. Some of these tags like JJ, VBZ, RB, VBG, NN are recognizable parts of speech according to the description, but others like RBN and WS WP do not directly correspond to any tag listed in the provided description. The correct approach should be selecting or providing a single appropriate tag from the list given in the description for the word in question.\n\nERR"
