  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is \"VBZ VBG\". The description states that the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag for a given word. However, the output contains two tags, which seems to be a violation of this rule. The thinking process behind this decision is that the description explicitly mentions returning \"just the tag\" for the word's part of speech, implying a single tag should be returned. The presence of two tags suggests non-compliance with this specific instruction.\n\nERR"
