However, 'SS' does not match any of the provided tags in the description, which could indicate an issue with compliance since the description lists specific and seemingly exhaustive tags without mentioning 'SS'. Given this, there appears to be a violation because the output includes an unrecognized tag 'SS' that is not specified in the description.\n\nERR"
