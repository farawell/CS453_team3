This could indicate either multiple tagging or lack of understanding of the sentence structure but from the given description we can not tell if this is correct for a particular word in a sentence as input is not provided. But one thing is certain that it has failed to follow the rule of returning just one tag for the word's part of speech as per the given chatbot description. \nERR"
