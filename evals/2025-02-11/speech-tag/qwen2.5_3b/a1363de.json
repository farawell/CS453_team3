The description does not explicitly state that the chatbot should return only one tag, but it also doesn't specify the correct format for returning multiple tags. However, since \"NN\" and \"VBZ\" are both listed as acceptable part-of-speech tags in the description, we can conclude that the output is compliant with the description in terms of the vocabulary used.\n\nOK"
