  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains multiple part-of-speech tags, which are VB, VPBJ is not a valid tag as per the given description and VBZ. The description specifies that the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag for the given word. However, the output provided includes three different tags without any clear indication that they are alternatives or if one is more appropriate than the others in this context. This seems to violate the principle of returning just one tag as specified in the description. Furthermore, VPBJ is not a recognized part-of-speech tag according to the list provided in the description.\n\nERR"
