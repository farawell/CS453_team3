The output \"JJ JJ\" contains two part of speech tags, which directly violates this requirement. My thinking is that since the description explicitly states to return just the tag for the word's part of speech and lists several possible tags but does not mention returning multiple tags, providing two tags in the output is non-compliant.\n\nERR"
