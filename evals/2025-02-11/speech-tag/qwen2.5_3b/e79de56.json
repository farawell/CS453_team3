However, according to the description, if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, return Unknown, and if you are unable to tag the word, return CantAnswer. But more importantly, it is stated that we should Return only the part of speech tag. The output seems to contain multiple tags which might be a violation of this rule. However, upon closer inspection, \"VCĐ\" does not seem to match any known or provided tag in the description and might indicate that it cannot be classified under any given category which would still indicate non compliance as Unknown should have been returned instead if the word couldnt be tagged with listed tags.\n\nERR"
