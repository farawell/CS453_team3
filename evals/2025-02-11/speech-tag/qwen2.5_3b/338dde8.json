The tag \"JJ\" is listed in the description as Adjective, however \"JJＲR\" does not seem to match any provided part-of-speech tag exactly as described. It seems like it could be related to \"JJR\", which is the tag for Adjective, comparative, but since \"JJＲR\" does not exactly match \"JJR\" and no such tag exists in the description, this indicates a possible non-compliance with the given description.\n\nERR"
