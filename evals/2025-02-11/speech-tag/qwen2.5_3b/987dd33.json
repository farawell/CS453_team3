According to the description, these tags are defined as 'NN': Noun, singular or mass and 'VBZ': Verb, 3rd person singular present. The description states that only one tag should be returned for a given word. Since two tags are provided for what appears to be a single response, this does not comply with the instruction to return just the tag for the word's part of speech.\n\nERR"
