  "complianceText": "The chatbot output appears to be a sequence of part-of-speech tags, which is in line with the description provided. The description states that the chatbot should return just the tag for the word's part of speech, and lists various possible tags. In this case, the output contains several tags separated by spaces, including DT (Determiner), VBing is not a valid tag as per the description but VBG is (Verb, gerund or present participle) however it could be an error in notation and JJ (Adjective) appears twice. Since VBing does not match any tag provided in the chatbot's description and there are multiple tags returned instead of just one for a single word it could potentially be a violation.\n\nERR"
