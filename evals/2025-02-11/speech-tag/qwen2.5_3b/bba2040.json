JJ corresponds to Adjective, which is a valid tag. However, the description does not explicitly state that the output can contain multiple tags or how they should be separated. Since it does not violate any rule explicitly stated in the description regarding the content of the tags themselves and no information about input is required to check this, we cannot conclude non compliance based on the information given.\n\nOK"
