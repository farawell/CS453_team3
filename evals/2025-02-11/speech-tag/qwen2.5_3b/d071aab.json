  "complianceText": "The chatbot output 'VBZ VBN' seems to be a combination of two part-of-speech tags, which are 'VBZ' (Verb, 3rd person singular present) and 'VBN' (Verb, past participle). According to the provided description, the task requires returning just the tag for the word's part of speech. Since the output contains more than one tag, it appears that the chatbot is providing multiple part-of-speech tags instead of a single one as specified in the description.\n\nERR"
