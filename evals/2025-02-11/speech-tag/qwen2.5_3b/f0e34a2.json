The space between 'VB' and 'Z' might be a formatting issue but it does not inherently violate any rules regarding the content of the response since the tag itself when ignoring the unnecessary space is a valid part-of-speech tag according to the provided description. Given this information, the chatbot's output appears to comply with the requirements as it returns a valid part of speech tag, even though the exact formatting might be slightly off due to the space.\n\nOK"
