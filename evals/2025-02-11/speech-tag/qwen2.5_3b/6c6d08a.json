  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is \"VB VBG VB\". The description requires the chatbot to return \"just the tag for the word's part of speech\" and lists specific options for parts of speech, including VB (Verb, base form) and VBG (Verb, gerund or present participle). However, returning multiple tags at once does not comply with the instruction to return only one tag. The thinking process behind this is that if a chatbot can return multiple tags, it doesn't follow the description's requirement of returning just one part of speech tag for a given word.\n\nERR"
