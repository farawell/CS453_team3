However, the chatbot has returned two tags \"JJ JJ\", which does not comply with the description that requires a single tag to be returned. The reasoning here is that the output should match one of the expected formats (a single part-of-speech tag, \"Unknown\", or \"CantAnswer\"), but instead it provides multiple tags, indicating non-compliance.\n\nERR"
