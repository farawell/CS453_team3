The thinking process behind this decision was carefully examining the description and checking if the output matches any of the listed tags or the special cases like 'Unknown' or 'CantAnswer', since 'VB' is indeed a valid tag as per the description, there seems to be no violation in terms of compliance with the given task. \n\nOK"
