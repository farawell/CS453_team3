  "complianceText": "The given output contains two parts of speech tags, JJ and VBZ, which are both part of the list provided in the description. The tag JJ represents an Adjective, and VBZ represents a Verb, 3rd person singular present. The output does not provide excessive information, nor does it return Unknown or CantAnswer when it seems like it should not be doing so based on the rules given, but since the task requires to return just the tag for the word's part of speech it is strange that two tags are returned instead of one. However, without knowing more about the input and considering only the rules which do not require knowing the input, we can say it does contain valid parts of speech tags according to the given description. But since it is supposed to return just the tag for a word's part of speech, returning two tags seems like non-compliance with that rule.\n\nERR"
