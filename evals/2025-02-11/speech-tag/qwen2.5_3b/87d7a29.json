  "complianceText": "The given output is \"VB VBG\". The description states that the chatbot should return just the tag for the word's part of speech. In this case, we have two tags, \"VB\" and \"VBG\", which both seem to be valid parts of speech according to the provided list. However, the description asks for a single tag to be returned. The output contains more than one part-of-speech tag, but it does not contain any text other than valid part-of-speech tags and it also does not return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\". Since we do not know which word was given as input, the rule that the chatbot should return just the tag for the word's part of speech is not verified as it depends on the input. However, one thing that can be said is that if there are two tags then either the output does not comply with the description or one of them should have been \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\". From what we see here the chatbot has provided valid part-of-speech tags but not according to the rules which state only one tag. \nERR"
