  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is 'VB VB'. The description requires the chatbot to return only one part of speech tag for a given word. However, in this case, the chatbot has returned two tags 'VB VB', which seems to be a repetition of the same tag. According to the rules specified in the description, if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, it should return Unknown and if unable to tag the word, it should return CantAnswer. But here the issue is not about unknown or cant answer but about returning only one tag. Since it repeated a tag instead of providing a different one, this does not seem like a case where either \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" would apply because it did provide a valid tag, just provided it twice. The description clearly states that the output should be only the part of speech tag, but it does not explicitly state what to do in the case of repeated tags, however the rule about returning just one tag for the word's part of speech is clear and this output does not comply with that.\n\nERR"
