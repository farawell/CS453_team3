According to the description provided, each tag has a specific meaning, such as NN for Noun, singular or mass, and VBZ for Verb, 3rd person singular present. However, the description asks to return just the tag for the word's part of speech. The output \"NN VBZ\" does not comply with this rule because it contains two separate tags instead of a single one as specified in the description.\n\nERR"
