  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is \"VB VB\". According to the description, the chatbot should return only one part of speech tag for the given word. The output contains two tags, which seems to be a violation of this rule. My reasoning is that the description explicitly states to return just the tag for the word's part of speech, implying a single tag should be provided.\n\nERR"
