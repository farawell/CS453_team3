However, 'VPBS' is not listed in the provided alphabetical list of part-of-speech tags. The description states that if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, it should return 'Unknown', and if unable to tag the word, it should return 'CantAnswer'. Since 'VPBS' does not match any known tag and also does not match 'Unknown' or 'CantAnswer', this indicates a non-compliance with the given description.\n\nERR"
