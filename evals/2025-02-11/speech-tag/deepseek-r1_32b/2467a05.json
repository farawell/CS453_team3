Since the input is not given and this rule does not require knowing the input to check compliance with the list of tags, we will just check if IN is one of the allowed tags as per the description. The output \"IN\" directly matches one of the specified part-of-speech tags listed in the description, therefore it complies with the chatbot's description for returning a valid part of speech tag. \nOK"
