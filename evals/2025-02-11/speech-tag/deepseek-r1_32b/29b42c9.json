  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot output \"NN\" is a part-of-speech tag that is listed in the description as \"Noun, singular or mass\". Since the output only contains the tag and does not provide any additional information, it complies with the description of returning just the tag for the word's part of speech. There are no signs of non-compliance such as extra words or characters, so based on this I conclude that the chatbot's output complies with its description.\n\nOK"
