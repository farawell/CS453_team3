  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output appears to be a list of part-of-speech tags, each on a separate line. The description specifies that the possible part-of-speech tags are given in an alphabetical list, and the output only contains tags from this list. There is no extra information provided with the tags, and there are multiple tags present. However, according to the description, if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, it should return \"Unknown\", and if unable to tag the word, it should return \"CantAnswer\". But most importantly the description asks for the part of speech tag for a given word, it does not explicitly restrict returning multiple tags but it implies that only one word is being evaluated. Since multiple tags are returned for presumably one input word the chatbot seems to be non compliant with the spirit of the instruction though technically if we consider each line as separate output for potentially different words then this could be seen as complaint. However given a sentence like \"The dog runs\" where 'dog' is a NN and 'runs' is VBZ, in all likelyhood multiple tags are provided rather than one tag per word, so the description and chatbot are not compliant.\n\nERR"
