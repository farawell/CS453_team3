This indicates that the chatbot has followed one of the specified rules for situations where it cannot provide a part-of-speech tag. The reasoning behind this decision is based on the fact that 'CantAnswer' is explicitly mentioned in the description as a valid output under certain conditions, and since we do not have access to the input, we must assume that the chatbot has legitimate reasons for selecting this response.\n\nOK"
