  "complianceText": "The chatbot output appears to be a list of part-of-speech tags as specified in the description provided between the delimiters <DESC> and </DESC>. The description mentions that the chatbot should return just the tag for the word's part of speech. However, at the end of the list of tags, it also says \"CantAnswer\". According to the description, if the chatbot is unable to tag a word, it should return \"CantAnswer\" instead of a list of tags. Therefore, outputting both a list of part-of-speech tags and \"CantAnswer\" seems inconsistent with the provided description because it indicates an inability to answer while still providing answers.\n\nERR"
