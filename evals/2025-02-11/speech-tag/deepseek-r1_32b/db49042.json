The description clearly states that the chatbot should determine the part of speech for a given word and return just the tag for the word's part of speech. Since no specific word was provided to the chatbot, it should have either returned CantAnswer or processed the sentenceword which is mentioned in its description but the output shows that the chatbot is not following these guidelines.\n\nERR"
