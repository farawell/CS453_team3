The description specifies that the output should be just the tag for the word's part of speech if it can be tagged with the listed tags, Unknown if the word cannot be tagged, or CantAnswer if unable to tag the word. Since the chatbot output only contains recognized part-of-speech tags as specified in the description without any additional text or explanations and each line corresponds to a single part-of-speech tag, there is no apparent violation of the format rules that can be checked without knowing the input.\n\nOK"
