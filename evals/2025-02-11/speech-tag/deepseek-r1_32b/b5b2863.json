Additionally, if the word cannot be tagged with these listed tags, it should return \"Unknown\", and if unable to tag the word, it should return \"CantAnswer\". \n\nIn this case, the chatbot output is \"NN\", which corresponds to a part of speech tag for a noun that is singular or mass. Since \"NN\" is among the allowed tags as per the description provided, there's no apparent violation of the rules based on the information given.\n\nOK"
