The tag \"JJ\" corresponds to \"Adjective\" according to the provided list. Since \"JJ\" is a valid part of speech tag as per the task description and it directly complies with the requirement of returning just the tag for the word's part of speech without any additional information, we conclude that there is no violation in terms of compliance regarding the format and type of output.\n\nOK"
