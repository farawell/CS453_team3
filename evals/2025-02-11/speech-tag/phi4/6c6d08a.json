However, the main issue here is that the chatbot is supposed to return only the part of speech tag, but instead, it returns multiple tags and a detailed explanation. The description explicitly states that the chatbot should \"Return only the part of speech tag.\" Therefore, the output does not comply with this specific requirement.\n\nERR"
