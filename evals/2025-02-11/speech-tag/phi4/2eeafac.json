This additional information is not requested according to the description. The description states that if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, return Unknown, and if unable to tag the word, return CantAnswer, but in this case, it seems the chatbot was able to identify the part of speech correctly as JJ. However, the output should only be \"JJ\" without any further explanation.\n\nERR"
