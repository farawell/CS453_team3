  "complianceText": "The chatbot output lists two words with their corresponding parts of speech tags. For the word \"are\", it is tagged as MD: Modal, and for the word \"sweet\", it is tagged as JJ: Adjective. The description specifies that the chatbot should return just the tag for the word's part of speech. However, in this case, the chatbot returns both the word and its corresponding tag. According to the description, the output should only include the part of speech tag, not the word itself. Therefore, I conclude that the output does not comply with the description because it includes the words in addition to their tags.\n\nERR"
