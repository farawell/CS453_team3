The description requires returning just the tag for the word's part of speech or specific conditions under which it cannot be tagged. Since the description explicitly lists JJ as an acceptable tag and the chatbot has indeed returned this tag after determining the word functions as an adjective, it directly complies with the given instructions regarding the format of acceptable responses.\n\nOK"
