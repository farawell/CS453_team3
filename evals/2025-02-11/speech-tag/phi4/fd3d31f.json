  "output": "warm - JJ  \nand - CC  \nwelcoming - JJ  \nsmile - NN  \n\nThese words are tagged based on their usage in the sentence. \"Warm\" and \"welcoming\" serve as adjectives describing \"smile,\" thus tagged as JJ (adjective). \"And\" functions as a coordinating conjunction, connecting two adjectives, hence CC. Lastly, \"smile\" is identified as a noun and is thus labeled NN.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output provides part-of-speech tags for the given words: warm - JJ, and - CC, welcoming - JJ, smile - NN. Each word is assigned a tag from the list of parts of speech provided in the description. The output directly corresponds to the tags mentioned in the description without providing any information that would require knowledge of the input sentence to verify compliance with the tagging rules. Since all the tags used are part of the listed tags in the description and there's no indication that the word cannot be tagged or that the chatbot is unable to tag it, the output complies with the given description.\n\nOK"
