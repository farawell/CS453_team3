  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output appears to be in the format of \"word: part-of-speech tag\", which is consistent with the description provided. The description requires the chatbot to return just the tag for the word's part of speech, but in this case, it returns the word along with its corresponding tag. However, considering the list of allowed tags provided in the description, we can see that \"VBG\" and \"IN\" are both valid tags according to the given list, which is a good sign.\n\nGiven the lack of information about the input sentence and the specific words being evaluated, we cannot assess whether these tags are correctly assigned or not. But since \"VBG\" and \"IN\" are listed as possible part-of-speech tags in the description, their presence alone does not indicate non-compliance.\n\nMoreover, there is no evident violation of the description's rules based on the information provided, since it does indeed return part-of-speech tags as required, albeit with the words themselves. \n\nOK"
