  "complianceText": "The given output contains multiple part-of-speech tags which are space-separated. Each tag seems to correspond to the list of part-of-speech tags provided in the chatbot description, such as RB for Adverb, JJ for Adjective, NN for Noun, and VBG for Verb, gerund or present participle. The presence of multiple tags suggests a breakdown of different words in a sentence with their respective parts of speech. However, according to the description, the chatbot should return just the tag for the word's part of speech if it can be tagged with one of the listed tags. The output provided does not adhere to this rule as it includes multiple tags rather than a single tag or \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" as specified in the description.\n\nERR"
