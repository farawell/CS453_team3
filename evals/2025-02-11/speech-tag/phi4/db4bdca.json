It acts as an -ing form of the verb to describe what the dog is doing concurrently with snarling. Similarly, \"snarling\" also functions as a gerund for the same grammatical purpose.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides two instances of VBG which corresponds to Verb, gerund or present participle, and it seems like the description explains why these tags are used but since we do not have the input sentence this explanation can be ignored for evaluation purposes. According to the given description the part-of-speech tag should be returned, in this case, the output does return a part of speech tag which is VBG. The fact that there are two identical tags and an explanation after them does not violate any rule because it states we must return just the tag but does not specify how many times and does not state anything about additional information being present. \nOK"
