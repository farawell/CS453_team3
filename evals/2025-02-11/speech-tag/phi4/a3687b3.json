  "complianceText": "The chatbot output includes various part-of-speech tags such as JJ, JJS, CC, and also mentions \"Unknown\" and \"CantAnswer\". The description specifies an Alphabetical list of part-of-speech tags used in this task and the rules for returning output. According to the description, if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, return Unknown, and if unable to tag the word, return CantAnswer. \nIn the given output, it seems like the chatbot has provided multiple tags which does seem like more information than what was asked but does not directly violate any of the stated rules since it is still among the allowed tags or specified exceptions.\nNo violation.\nOK"
