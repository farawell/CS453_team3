  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides a list of words with their corresponding part-of-speech tags. Each line contains a word and its tag, separated by a space and a hyphen. The tags used are: MD for \"is\", CC for \"and\", JJ for both \"warm\" and \"comforting\". These tags (MD, CC, JJ) are present in the list of allowed part-of-speech tags provided in the description. There is no extraneous information or non-tagged words that would suggest a failure to comply with the given instructions. The format appears straightforward, listing each word and its respective tag without additional commentary that could be seen as non-compliant. Given this observation, it seems the chatbot output adheres to the requirements outlined in the description.\n\nOK"
