  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides multiple part-of-speech tags for different words, which seems to go beyond the description that requires returning just the tag for the word's part of speech. The description does not explicitly state that the chatbot should provide tags for all words in a sentence or offer an option to identify the part of speech for specific words. Instead, it suggests that the chatbot should return a single part-of-speech tag as the response. Additionally, the presence of explanatory text like \"If you wish to identify the part of speech for a specific word in this sentence, let me know!\" does not align with the instruction to return only the part of speech tag or one of the specified alternatives (Unknown, CantAnswer).\n\nERR"
