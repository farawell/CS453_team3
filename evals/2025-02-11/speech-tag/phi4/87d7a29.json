  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output seems to be providing a part-of-speech tag for the word \"At\". However, the description states that the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag, such as IN for preposition or subordinating conjunction. The inclusion of the explanation \"Preposition or subordinating conjunction\" after the colon is not in line with the instruction to return \"only the part of speech tag\". This suggests a violation of the specified format.\n\nERR"
