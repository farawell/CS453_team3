  "complianceText": "The given output provides a detailed explanation of why the word \"outside\" is tagged as an adverb, but it does not directly comply with the description which requires returning only the part of speech tag. The chatbot's output includes additional information such as the sentence and the reasoning behind the tagging, whereas it should have only returned the tag for the word's part of speech. Based on this observation, I conclude that there is a violation of the rule that specifies the output format.\n\nERR"
