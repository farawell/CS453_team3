  "output": "In this sentence, we need to determine the part of speech for the word \"blooming.\"\n\n- \"Blooming\" is derived from the verb \"bloom,\" and in this context, it describes the action taking place with the subject \"The flowers.\"\n- The verb form used here is a present participle, which functions as an adjective or as part of a continuous tense verb. Since it follows the auxiliary verb \"are,\" indicating a continuous action performed by \"the flowers,\" it plays the role of forming a progressive aspect.\n\nTherefore, the part of speech for \"blooming\" in this sentence is VBG: Verb, gerund or present participle.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides an explanation and justification for its answer but ultimately returns a part-of-speech tag. The description requires returning just the tag for the word's part of speech if it can be tagged with the listed tags, or \"Unknown\" if it cannot be tagged with those tags, or \"CantAnswer\" if unable to tag the word. In this case, the output does indeed return a valid part-of-speech tag (VBG: Verb, gerund or present participle) but also includes additional explanatory text which is not requested in the description. Despite returning the correct tag as per one of the options, it fails to comply with the requirement of returning \"only\" the part of speech tag due to the inclusion of this explanatory content.\n\nERR"
