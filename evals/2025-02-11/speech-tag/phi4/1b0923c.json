  "complianceText": "The chatbot output lists specific words with their corresponding part of speech tags. It provides the tag definitions as well. Based on the description provided between <DESC> and </DESC>, the chatbot should return just the tag for the word's part of speech, but here it also provides a definition for each tag used which is not strictly according to the rules since the rules ask for only the part of speech tag. However, this does not necessarily mean the output is incorrect in terms of what was asked to be evaluated because we do not know if these definitions were always going to be provided or just added here. What can be checked from the description without knowing the input is that it returns part of speech tags which are listed, and it does so without returning \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\". The output seems mostly compliant with instructions but only deviates by providing extra information that was not strictly requested.\n\nOK"
