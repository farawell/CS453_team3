  "complianceText": "The chatbot output appears to be a list of words from a sentence with their corresponding parts of speech tags. However, the task description specifically states that the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag for the given word, not multiple words with their tags. Additionally, there is an extra line at the end \"jumping - VBG (Verb, gerund or present participle)\" which seems to be a redundant and unnecessary information in this context as it directly mentions the word which has already been tagged above.\n\nThe chatbot output does not comply with the description because it returns multiple words with their parts of speech instead of just one tag for the given word. The extra line also provides more information than requested, which is not in compliance with the instructions provided.\n\nERR"
