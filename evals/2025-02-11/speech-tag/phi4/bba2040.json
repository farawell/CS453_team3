  "complianceText": "I am evaluating the given chatbot output to determine if it complies with the provided description. The description requires that for each word, only the part of speech tag should be returned. If the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, it should return Unknown, and if unable to tag the word, it should return CantAnswer. The given output provides a list of words with their respective parts of speech, which seems to follow the format described, as each line contains a word followed by its part of speech tag, such as \"stars - NNS\" for the noun plural or \"shining - VBG\" for the verb gerund or present participle. However, it includes an additional line stating \"CantAnswer (only one sentence, repeat) - CantAnswer\", which does not follow the described format because it appears to be a directive rather than a part of speech identification and also includes an explanation or a note which is not supposed to be there according to description provided. This extra information seems to violate the instruction to return only the part of speech tag for each word, as it adds unnecessary text that doesn't adhere to the specified format. Therefore, this output does not comply with the chatbot description because it includes extraneous information beyond simple part of speech tagging.\nERR"
