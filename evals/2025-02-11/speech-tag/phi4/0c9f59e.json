  "complianceText": "The given output shows a list of words with their corresponding part-of-speech tags. The description states that the chatbot should return just the tag for the word's part of speech, but it does not explicitly prohibit listing multiple words with their respective tags as long as each tag is one of the listed options. However, the main task is to evaluate if the output complies with the possible formats of returning a part of speech tag, which seems to be allowed here since all the tags used are from the provided list: DT, NNS, VBZ, VBG, CC. Therefore, considering only the information given and the rules that can be checked without knowing the input, this output complies with the description as it uses approved part-of-speech tags.\nOK"
