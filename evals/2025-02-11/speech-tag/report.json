Given that we are only checking for compliance with rules that can be verified without knowing the input, this does not necessarily constitute a violation since the description's direct application to this output cannot be fully assessed without knowing which specific word was being queried.\n\nHowever, considering the strict interpretation of \"Return only the part of speech tag,\" if we assume the chatbot is expected to return just one tag, then providing multiple words and tags could be seen as non-compliance. Yet, given our task does not include evaluating correctness based on the unseen input but rather just compliance with the format and rules provided in the description that can be checked without knowing the input, this may seem like a gray area.\n\nGiven these considerations and focusing strictly on what we can evaluate (compliance with returning part-of-speech tags as described), since each tag is indeed one of the acceptable part-of-speech tags listed in the description, there's an argument to be made for both compliance and non-compliance. However, the main critique could be that it does not follow the instruction to return \"only\" the part of speech tag if we assume only one word was being asked about.\n\nDespite this, since our primary criteria should be based on what can be directly evaluated against the description without assuming details not provided (like the input), and considering the output does indeed consist of recognized part-of-speech tags as per the description's list, there is no explicit violation of format that we are instructed to check for in a strict sense. \n\nSo the decision hinges on our interpretation of \"only\" the tag being requested without knowing which word was specified, yet given all provided tags are legitimate and follow the listed alphabetical part-of-speech tags, it suggests an adherence to at least part of the description.\n\nERR",

However, since it doesn't directly violate any rule that can be checked without knowing the input (like returning an invalid tag), and we should focus on compliance with format instructions rather than correctness in a strict sense, there seems to be no direct violation based solely on the output's form without considering context or the quantity of tags returned.\n\nTherefore, focusing strictly on whether the tags themselves are valid according to the given list, they are. The issue might arise from the instruction's implication of a single tag but since we can't assess the correctness or the situation fully due to lack of input, and both \"DT\" and \"VBP\" are legitimate parts of speech based on the description provided, it appears there is no clear non-compliance with what is explicitly stated regarding valid tags.\n\nHowever, re-reading for clarity: The task implicitly suggests a singular output per query. Returning two tags (\"DT\" and \"VBP\") could imply the chatbot is either tagging two different words or providing options, neither of which aligns perfectly with being asked to return \"just the tag.\" This indicates an issue in interpreting the instruction as wanting only one response but doesn't violate the rule about what tags can be used because both are listed.\n\nUpon further reflection: Given the strict format and description without making assumptions beyond them, returning two valid tags still doesn't align perfectly with instructions for a singular response per word's part of speech but does not explicitly break a compliance rule that can be checked without knowing the input since it involves an interpretation of how many responses are expected rather than what constitutes a valid response.\n\nThus, based on the need to adhere strictly to the format provided and ensure evaluation is grounded exclusively in textual content without speculation about the chatbot's processing or input it received: There seems to be an issue with the output providing two tags which was not directly addressed as acceptable in the description provided for part-of-speech tagging but doesn't clearly violate a rule that can be assessed without knowing more context.\n\nGiven this nuanced situation and focusing on direct compliance only without assuming the context or number of words being tagged: The critical point is whether returning two valid tags constitutes non-compliance under the strict interpretation of providing \"just the tag\" for what seems to imply a singular item of output, which it might given typical expectations but doesn't necessarily based on rules that can be checked without input knowledge.\n\nSince we are evaluating compliance not correctness and both DT and VBP are indeed recognized tags: The real question revolves around if returning two tags directly violates any stated rule or instructional guidance about the nature of the expected response. It suggests a misunderstanding in how to apply the instruction for singular tag output but doesn't break the core rule about using listed part-of-speech tags since both provided are valid.\n\nHence, the evaluation process leans towards understanding the compliance based on given instructions and known parameters without inferring beyond what is explicitly mentioned: Considering this tightly defined scope of analysis focused solely on textual description compliance, there's a concern with multi-tag output but evaluating strictly within these bounds requires recognizing both returned tags as individually compliant while questioning format adherence regarding singular versus multiple tag returns.\n\nTo resolve the evaluation directly in line with provided instructions and without further speculation about intent or additional context: The strict interpretation suggests one should expect a singular part-of-speech tag per response but the critical aspect of compliance here revolves around the nature of those tags being valid according to listed types rather than their count, which introduces complexity when assessing strictly against provided description guidelines.\n\nFor the purpose of maintaining this evaluation within explicitly stated bounds without inference: Both DT and VBP match recognized categories from the list. The discussion thus centers on whether multiple outputs fit the implicit singular expectation based on \"just the tag\" phrasing, highlighting a potential for non-compliance in output format rather than content validity given known parameters.\n\nERR",

The description outlines a list of acceptable part-of-speech tags and instructs the chatbot to return just the tag for the word's part of speech, or \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, or \"CantAnswer\" if unable to tag the word.\n\nLooking at the output \"DT NN VB JJ CC JJ\", it consists of a series of abbreviations which correspond to parts of speech as defined in the description (e.g., DT for Determiner, NN for Noun, singular or mass, VB for Verb, base form, etc.). The presence of these abbreviations suggests that the chatbot is attempting to provide part-of-speech tags. However, without the context of the input sentence and word, it's not possible to assess whether these tags are correct or if the chatbot has applied them appropriately.\n\nGiven the information provided in the description and focusing solely on compliance with the rules that do not require knowledge of the input (such as the format and options for response), the output appears to be a list of part-of-speech tags. This could potentially be seen as non-compliant because the instructions seem to imply a single tag should be returned for a given word, unless the task involves multiple words or a sequence that necessitates multiple tags.\n\nHowever, considering the lack of explicit direction on how to handle outputs when multiple tags are necessary or when the input might contain multiple words (and thus potentially requiring multiple part-of-speech tags), and focusing strictly on compliance with described rules that can be checked without knowing the input, one could argue for either compliance or non-compliance based on interpretation.\n\nBut considering we should evaluate solely based on direct and explicit compliance without speculating or making assumptions about the chatbot's output beyond what is given, and since there's no clear violation of format (as the tags are recognizable parts of speech from the list provided), yet acknowledging that returning multiple tags might not align perfectly with \"return just the tag for the word's part of speech\" if we assume a single word input:\n\nNo explicit rule in the description directly addresses how the output should be structured when it comes to handling potential sequences or lists of tags for words. Therefore, given this is about compliance and not correctness and focusing on the inability to verify certain aspects without the input, I would reason that since the response does contain recognizable parts-of-speech tags from the list provided in the description, there isn't a straightforward violation based solely on the information given.\n\nHowever, since it specifically instructs to return \"just the tag for the word's part of speech\" and this output contains multiple tags which might imply multiple words or a specific sequence not clearly addressed in the rules provided for this evaluation:\n\nGiven these considerations, my decision leans towards there being no explicit violation directly observable based on the given description alone because we cannot verify if the input was one word or multiple, but since it does explicitly state to return just the tag and this contains multiple, if we strictly interpret \"just the tag\" as singular:\n\nERR",

The chatbot can return one of several predefined tags or \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, or \"CantAnswer\" if it is unable to tag the word.\n\nThe output provided by the chatbot includes multiple parts-of-speech tags: DT NN VBZ VBG IN DT JJ NN. These abbreviations correspond to specific parts of speech as defined in the task description (e.g., DT for Determiner, NN for Noun, singular or mass, VBZ for Verb, 3rd person singular present, etc.).\n\nGiven this information, I will assess compliance based on whether the output adheres to the format and content guidelines provided. The main guideline here is that the chatbot should return a part-of-speech tag or one of the specified return values (\"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\") for a word.\n\nThe thinking process involves checking if the returned tags are legitimate according to the task description, which they are, as each abbreviation corresponds to a defined part of speech. However, the instruction is to return just the tag for the word's part of speech, implying a single value should be returned unless the task has been misunderstood or modified to accommodate multiple words.\n\nSince the output includes multiple parts-of-speech tags separated by spaces (DT NN VBZ VBG IN DT JJ NN), it appears that either the chatbot is providing tags for multiple words in the sentence (which could be a valid interpretation if the input contained multiple target words) or there's an issue with how the task was interpreted regarding the output format.\n\nWithout knowing the exact input or instructions given to the chatbot beyond what's provided, I must decide based solely on whether this output could potentially comply with any reasonable interpretation of the task. Given that parts-of-speech tagging can indeed involve multiple tags for different words in a sentence and assuming the chatbot was tasked with analyzing more than one word, this output does technically consist of valid part-of-speech tags as per the provided description.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note the instruction's emphasis on returning \"just the tag\" which could imply an expectation for a single response unless multiple words were being analyzed. The absence of clarity on whether the input consisted of one word or multiple words means we must focus strictly on the output's compliance with possible interpretations of the task where multiple tags might be relevant.\n\nGiven these considerations and focusing solely on compliance without assuming correctness regarding the input:\n\nOK",

It provides an alphabetical list of part-of-speech tags used in this task.\n\nThe chatbot's output is \"DT NN VBZ VBG IN DT JJ CC JJ NN\". This output appears to be a sequence of part-of-speech tags as defined in the description. Each tag corresponds to a specific part of speech (e.g., DT for Determiner, NN for Noun, singular or mass, VBZ for Verb, 3rd person singular present, etc.). \n\nHowever, according to the chatbot's description, it should return \"just the tag for the word's part of speech\" if it can tag the word. The presence of multiple tags (e.g., DT, NN, VBZ, VBG, IN, etc.) in the output suggests that either the chatbot is tagging more than one word or it's providing a sequence of possible tags without specifying which word each corresponds to.\n\nGiven this analysis and following the guidelines provided for evaluation, we observe that the output format seems to deviate from the expected \"just the tag for the word's part of speech\" since multiple tags are provided. This could imply an inability to follow instructions precisely as given or an implicit assumption about the nature of the input not detailed in the description.\n\nThus, considering the requirement for the chatbot to return a single tag unless it cannot tag the word (in which case it should return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\"), and noting that the output does contain recognized part-of-speech tags but multiple ones, we assess compliance based on adherence to specified format and explicit instructions.\n\nThe output does not follow the instruction to return just one tag for the word's part of speech as it provides multiple tags.

However, since we do not have access to the input (the sentence and the specific word in question), we can only evaluate if the provided tags could potentially be correct based on the list of acceptable tags and if the format seems appropriate.\n\nThe format seems consistent with what one might expect: each line lists a word followed by its part-of-speech tag. The tags used are from the list provided in the description (CC, DT, NN, VBZ, VBG, IN, JJ). There is no extra information or deviation from the task of providing part-of-speech tags for words.\n\nHowever, since we're only given a list without knowing which word was supposed to be tagged according to the task, and because the instruction implies that only one tag should be returned for a specific word in question, this output seems not to comply strictly with the \"Return just the tag for the word's part of speech\" if we interpret it as requiring a single word's tag. But given the constraints of our evaluation (not knowing the input), this appears more like an interpretation issue rather than a clear violation of format or content rules directly checkable without input.\n\nBut considering another perspective, if the task implicitly requires handling multiple words (as suggested by the list provided) and the instruction is seen as asking for the tags of all words in the sentence (though not explicitly stated), then this output could be viewed as compliant because it provides a list of part-of-speech tags without including any information that would directly violate the given rules.\n\nGiven these considerations, the critical factor is whether we interpret the task as strictly requesting a single tag for one specific word or if we see it as potentially encompassing the tagging of all words in a sentence. The description could be clearer on this point.\n\nSince we cannot know which interpretation is correct without more context (the input), and focusing strictly on compliance with provided rules that do not require knowing the input, the safest conclusion based solely on the information given would lean towards seeing if there's an obvious violation of format or content that does not depend on the input.

However, since the input is not provided, it's unclear if this output corresponds to multiple words being tagged or an error in interpretation.\n\nGiven the strict guidelines and focusing solely on compliance with the tags listed and without knowing the input, I must conclude based on available information.\n\nOK",

The list includes standard parts of speech like noun (NN), verb (VBZ), adjective (JJ), adverb (RB), and others. Each line represents a word from the sentence with its part-of-speech tag, and all the tags used seem to come from the provided list in the description.\n\nThe instruction to return just the tag for the word's part of speech if possible or \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with listed tags, or \"CantAnswer\" if unable to tag the word is not being followed in the context of the entire output given it seems to process multiple words. However, since we do not know which specific word was supposed to be evaluated and as per guidelines, checks requiring knowledge of input should be ignored.\n\nTherefore, based solely on compliance with the format and usage of tags without considering the input or the expectation of a singular response for one word, the chatbot's output does adhere to using proper part-of-speech tags from the listed options provided in the description. Yet, it seems to deviate by processing what appears to be an entire sentence rather than a single given word as implied, though this cannot be confirmed without knowing the input.\n\nIn conclusion, considering only what can be evaluated directly and ignoring aspects that require knowledge of the input, there is no apparent violation of using incorrect tags or formats for the tags themselves.\n\nNo obvious direct violation can be identified based on the description alone without making assumptions about the intended input.\nOK",

But since the task explicitly asks to check if the given output complies with its description and we have been provided an output which has multiple words instead of one word, this clearly violates the rule that says \"Return only the part of speech tag\" because we are supposed to know the input to decide whether all those parts are correct or not but in general, a single word should have been given. \n\nERR",

The description states that the chatbot should return just the tag for the word's part of speech. The given output is \"twinkling: VBG (Verb, gerund or present participle)\". This includes both the part of speech tag and its explanation. According to the description, it should only return the part of speech tag if the rules are followed strictly as written, but there's also a consideration for how the instructions are understood in practice.\n\nHowever, focusing strictly on compliance without considering input, the chatbot does provide a recognized part-of-speech tag (\"VBG\") which is listed in the description. The issue here might seem to be the inclusion of the word \"twinkling\" and its full description \"(Verb, gerund or present participle)\", but since we're not evaluating correctness based on input and focusing only on compliance with possible output formats, the critical piece is that it does contain a valid part-of-speech tag as requested.\n\nThe description asks for \"just the tag for the word's part of speech,\" which might imply that additional information (like the full description of the tag) shouldn't be included. But since we're looking at strict compliance without input and considering that the chatbot has provided a valid tag, the main focus is on whether it adheres to the prescribed format of providing a recognizable part-of-speech tag, which it does.\n\nConsidering the guidelines for evaluation, I must decide if this output complies with the given description based solely on what's explicitly stated. The critical aspect here is that despite providing more information than perhaps expected (the full descriptor of the VBG tag), the essence of compliance—providing a valid part-of-speech tag—is fulfilled.\n\nGiven these considerations, my decision leans towards accepting this as compliant because it does directly answer with a part-of-speech tag that is recognized by the guidelines provided. However, strict adherence to instructions might suggest otherwise due to the inclusion of explanatory text alongside the tag.\n\nSince I must make a binary decision and given that the core request (to return a part-of-speech tag) is indeed fulfilled, albeit not in the most minimalistic form possible, my evaluation process leads me to conclude that while there's an argument for both compliance and non-compliance based on how strictly one interprets \"just the tag,\" the output does contain all necessary information as per the description and recognized tags are used.\n\nOK",

This implies that instead of directly answering with a part-of-speech tag, the chatbot is engaging in a dialogue which could potentially be seen as non-compliant with the straightforward instruction to return \"just the tag for the word's part of speech.\"\n\nHowever, since we are strictly evaluating compliance based on the output format and content without knowing the input or specific context that might necessitate choosing between words for further breakdown, the critical point of focus is whether the chatbot provided a recognizable part-of-speech tag as requested.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems there's an issue with directly following the description due to the interactive element introduced in the output, but without knowing the input (the sentence and word contained within that sentence), we can't fully assess if this interaction was necessary or appropriate based on the task's constraints.

To evaluate this output against the description, we must first determine if all returned tags are within the list provided by the description and if the format is as expected.\n\nUpon reviewing the output, it's clear that most words have been assigned part-of-speech tags in accordance with the list provided (e.g., DT for \"The\", NN for \"grass\", VBZ for \"is\", VBG for \"swaying\", RB for \"gently\", IN for \"in\", DT for \"the\", and NN for \"breeze\"). However, there's an additional comment at the end regarding \"Gently: RBR (Adverb, comparative)\" which suggests that \"gently\" should be classified as an Adverb, comparative.\n\nThe issue arises with the classification of \"gently\". Initially, it is correctly identified as RB (Adverb), but then there's a correction or additional note stating it should be RBR (Adverb, comparative). The description does not explicitly state how corrections or multiple classifications for a single word should be handled. However, given that RBR is indeed part of the list of acceptable tags and \"gently\" can function as an adverb in a comparative form in certain contexts (though based on the sentence provided it seems to be used in its base form), this could potentially be seen as additional information rather than an error.\n\nThe critical factor here is whether the output complies with the description without assuming or inferring content not directly provided. Since all tags are from the list of part-of-speech tags defined and there's no explicit instruction on handling potential corrections or dual classifications, we cannot strictly count this as a violation based solely on the direct compliance criteria.\n\nThus, considering only the information given and adhering strictly to the format requested for the evaluation without speculating about intended meaning or correctness in context (as that would require knowing the input), there's no clear-cut reason to declare an error purely based on non-compliance with explicit rules provided in the description.\n\nThe reasoning process leads to the conclusion that the chatbot output, as presented, does comply with the instructions regarding the use of predefined part-of-speech tags and does not explicitly violate any rule directly stated in the description about output format or acceptable tags.\nOK",

Part-2 - Implement a multi-layer perceptron model to solve the classification problem of digits (0-9) from MNIST dataset using back-propagation algorithm.\n     * For part 2, I'll be following code snippets provided by Prof during class for various steps like initialization and feed forward as explained in assignment document. Hence my file will not have the complete implementation but rather an approach to solve it.\n\n   **The structure of my program :**\n   \n   We are using 4 classes one of each :\n   \n   * Network: Class that performs all network operations, i.e., initialization with random weights and biases, forward propagation, backward propagations etc.\n   * Layer: Class for layer object. It holds the neurons/weights/biases for any specific level.\n   * Activation: Base class for different kinds of activation functions that we can perform.\n       We can derive some classes to this base one which are used later in code according to need, e.g, sigmoid, tanh etc.\n   * TrainTestSplit : Class for splitting the dataset into train and test as well as preprocessing them if required. It inherits from Activation class because all activation functions needs to be applied before training on any layer.\n\nNote: I have written a lot of comments in code so that it's easier to understand what exactly is happening at every step.\n      \n   **Code snippets** :\n\n    ```py\n    # For this assignment we are not using Keras instead using plain tensorflow with some help from numpy and sklearn.\n    # Importing required libraries\n    import tensorflow as tf\n    from helperFunctions import *\n    import pandas as pd\n    import matplotlib.pyplot\n\n\n       # Network class that holds methods needed for different training stages in neural nerwork\n    \n    class network(object):\n    \n        def __init__(self, layers, epochs=1, learningRate = 0.01):\n            self.layers = layers\n            self.learning_rate = learningRate\n            self.weights, self.biases = initialize(self.layers)\n```\n   \n   ```py\n       # This function for forward propagation as it helps us calculate activations using each layer's weight and biases.\n    def feedForward(trainInputs):\n\n        numLayers = len(layers) # Number of layers from user input\n\n        # Iterate through all provided inputs using the above calculated values to provide output activation from every layer.\n\n        activations = trainInputs\n        prevActivated=trainInputs\n        for i in range(numLayers):\n            layerValue = tf.matmul(activations, self.weights[i]) +self.biases[i]\n            # Calculating layer's value as dot product of it's weights with previously provided activated value and adding bias.\n            # Activating the value using required activation function (sigmoid here).\n            \n            activations=sigmoid(layerValue)  # Activated values by sigmoid\n            print(\"Activation \",i, \" : \", activations[0][:5]) #Printing some values for debugging purposes\n            \n            prevActivated=activations \n        return [activations,prevActivated] ```\n\n    ```py\n        #This function implements back propagation as discussed in course.\n\n    def backwardPropagation(yTrue,yPrediction,sample):\n    \n        predictions = self.feedForward(sample)\n        numLayers=len(self.layers)\n        lossGradient=None\n        \n        for i in reversed(range(numLayers)):\n            if(i==numLayers-1): #for output layer\n                a0=  yPrediction - yTrue # Loss gradient dC/dp = p-y; where, p = predicted value , and y = true value\n                lossGrad=sigmoidPrime(predictions[0]) * a0 # dC/dz = dC/dp*dp/dsigmoid(z) ; where z is linear result\n                \n            else: # if its an inner layer then we do a sum of values by multiplication based on chain rule.\n                x=(lossGradient).dot(self.weights[i+1][::-1])\n                lossGrad=x * sigmoidPrime(predictions[0])\n            \n            gradientWeights=lossGrad.dot( np.atleast_2d(prevActivated[i]).T) # dC/dw = (dC/dz)(dz/dW), Where z is output of layer, W and b are weights/bias.\n            gradientBiases=np.sum(lossGrad,axis=1,keepdims=True)\n            \n                # Updating the gradients\n            \n            self.gradientsW[i]=self.gradientsW[i]-gradientWeights\n            self.gradientsB[i]=self.gradientsB[i]-gradientBiases\n        return \n    ```\n   \n   **Training loop**:\n    \n    ```py\n   \n        # The function below contains the steps that happens during each training and validation iteration in a particular epoch\n\n    def train(self, y_true, sample, isValidation=False): #Function to train network based on inputs\n    \n        \n            \n        predictions=self.feedForward(sample)\n        \n\n        if(isValidation==False):\n            self.backwardPropagation(y_true,predictions[0],sample)  # Train backprop only for train set.

A revised version of these functions could be:\n\n```python\ndef sign_change(lst):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of negative and positive numbers from the input list.\"\"\"\n    neg = [x for x in lst if x < 0]\n    pos = [x for x in lst if x > 0]\n    return neg, pos\n\ndef summation(lst, x):\n    \"\"\"Finds pairs of numbers in the list that sum up to the target value.\"\"\"\n    neg, pos = sign_change(lst)\n    res = []\n    counter = 0\n    for p in pos:\n        try:\n            neg_index = neg.index(-1 * (p + x))\n            res.append([p, neg[neg_index]])\n            counter += 1\n        except ValueError:\n            pass\n    return res, counter\n```\n\nNote that these revised functions still have limitations and may not cover all edge cases.\n\nTo improve the overall quality of your code, I recommend:\n\n1. Using more descriptive variable names and docstrings to explain the purpose of each function.\n2. Testing your code with various inputs to ensure it works correctly in different scenarios.\n3. Considering edge cases and handling potential errors or exceptions that may arise during execution.\n4. Refactoring your code to make it more efficient, readable, and maintainable.\n\nIf you have specific questions about any of these code snippets or would like further assistance, feel free to ask!",

Therefore, since each tag returned by the chatbot corresponds to valid part-of-speech tags according to the task's description, and considering we are evaluating compliance rather than correctness or relevance to an unseen input:\n\nOK",

The description requires the chatbot to return just the tag for the word's part of speech if the task is about determining the part of speech for a given word, but since this specific instruction can only be checked with knowledge of the input and which word's part of speech is being asked for, we ignore it. However, the description also lists possible part-of-speech tags that should be used. Looking at the output provided by the chatbot, all the tags (DT, VBZ, VBG, IN, JJ, CC, NN) are indeed present in the list of allowed part-of-speech tags given in the description. Additionally, for words like \"quiet,\" it is correctly identified with a tag that matches one from the list provided in the description (JJ for Adjective). Given this information and adhering strictly to the guidelines without inferring or speculating about the input, there's no apparent violation of the rules as per the given description regarding part-of-speech tags used. \n\nOK",

Part-2 - Implement a multi-layer perceptron model to solve the classification problem of digits (0-9) from MNIST dataset using back-propagation algorithm.\n     * For part 2, I'll be following code snippets provided by Prof during class for various steps like initialization and feed forward as explained in assignment document. Hence my file will not have the complete implementation but rather an approach to solve it.\n\n   **The structure of my program :**\n   \n   We are using 4 classes one of each :\n   \n   * Network: Class that performs all network operations, i.e., initialization with random weights and biases, forward propagation, backward propagations etc.\n   * Layer: Class for layer object. It holds the neurons/weights/biases for any specific level.\n   * Activation: Base class for different kinds of activation functions that we can perform.\n       We can derive some classes to this base one which are used later in code according to need, e.g, sigmoid, tanh etc.\n   * TrainTestSplit : Class for splitting the dataset into train and test as well as preprocessing them if required. It inherits from Activation class because all activation functions needs to be applied before training on any layer.\n\nNote: I have written a lot of comments in code so that it's easier to understand what exactly is happening at every step.\n      \n   **Code snippets** :\n\n    ```py\n    # For this assignment we are not using Keras instead using plain tensorflow with some help from numpy and sklearn.\n    # Importing required libraries\n    import tensorflow as tf\n    from helperFunctions import *\n    import pandas as pd\n    import matplotlib.pyplot\n\n\n       # Network class that holds methods needed for different training stages in neural nerwork\n    \n    class network(object):\n    \n        def __init__(self, layers, epochs=1, learningRate = 0.01):\n            self.layers = layers\n            self.learning_rate = learningRate\n            self.weights, self.biases = initialize(self.layers)\n```\n   \n   ```py\n       # This function for forward propagation as it helps us calculate activations using each layer's weight and biases.\n    def feedForward(trainInputs):\n\n        numLayers = len(layers) # Number of layers from user input\n\n        # Iterate through all provided inputs using the above calculated values to provide output activation from every layer.\n\n        activations = trainInputs\n        prevActivated=trainInputs\n        for i in range(numLayers):\n            layerValue = tf.matmul(activations, self.weights[i]) +self.biases[i]\n            # Calculating layer's value as dot product of it's weights with previously provided activated value and adding bias.\n            # Activating the value using required activation function (sigmoid here).\n            \n            activations=sigmoid(layerValue)  # Activated values by sigmoid\n            print(\"Activation \",i, \" : \", activations[0][:5]) #Printing some values for debugging purposes\n            \n            prevActivated=activations \n        return [activations,prevActivated] ```\n\n    ```py\n        #This function implements back propagation as discussed in course.\n\n    def backwardPropagation(yTrue,yPrediction,sample):\n    \n        predictions = self.feedForward(sample)\n        numLayers=len(self.layers)\n        lossGradient=None\n        \n        for i in reversed(range(numLayers)):\n            if(i==numLayers-1): #for output layer\n                a0=  yPrediction - yTrue # Loss gradient dC/dp = p-y; where, p = predicted value , and y = true value\n                lossGrad=sigmoidPrime(predictions[0]) * a0 # dC/dz = dC/dp*dp/dsigmoid(z) ; where z is linear result\n                \n            else: # if its an inner layer then we do a sum of values by multiplication based on chain rule.\n                x=(lossGradient).dot(self.weights[i+1][::-1])\n                lossGrad=x * sigmoidPrime(predictions[0])\n            \n            gradientWeights=lossGrad.dot( np.atleast_2d(prevActivated[i]).T) # dC/dw = (dC/dz)(dz/dW), Where z is output of layer, W and b are weights/bias.\n            gradientBiases=np.sum(lossGrad,axis=1,keepdims=True)\n            \n                # Updating the gradients\n            \n            self.gradientsW[i]=self.gradientsW[i]-gradientWeights\n            self.gradientsB[i]=self.gradientsB[i]-gradientBiases\n        return \n    ```\n   \n   **Training loop**:\n    \n    ```py\n   \n        # The function below contains the steps that happens during each training and validation iteration in a particular epoch\n\n    def train(self, y_true, sample, isValidation=False): #Function to train network based on inputs\n    \n        \n            \n        predictions=self.feedForward(sample)\n        \n\n        if(isValidation==False):\n            self.backwardPropagation(y_true,predictions[0],sample)  # Train backprop only for train set.

A revised version of these functions could be:\n\n```python\ndef sign_change(lst):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of negative and positive numbers from the input list.\"\"\"\n    neg = [x for x in lst if x < 0]\n    pos = [x for x in lst if x > 0]\n    return neg, pos\n\ndef summation(lst, x):\n    \"\"\"Finds pairs of numbers in the list that sum up to the target value.\"\"\"\n    neg, pos = sign_change(lst)\n    res = []\n    counter = 0\n    for p in pos:\n        try:\n            neg_index = neg.index(-1 * (p + x))\n            res.append([p, neg[neg_index]])\n            counter += 1\n        except ValueError:\n            pass\n    return res, counter\n```\n\nNote that these revised functions still have limitations and may not cover all edge cases.\n\nTo improve the overall quality of your code, I recommend:\n\n1. Using more descriptive variable names and docstrings to explain the purpose of each function.\n2. Testing your code with various inputs to ensure it works correctly in different scenarios.\n3. Considering edge cases and handling potential errors or exceptions that may arise during execution.\n4. Refactoring your code to make it more efficient, readable, and maintainable.\n\nIf you have specific questions about any of these code snippets or would like further assistance, feel free to ask!",

So given that all other items \"NN\" and \"IN\" are correct part-of-speech tags according to the description provided and assuming the 'ing' is just extra information which shouldnt have been there but VBP would be an allowed tag, no violation of the rules has occurred with the exception of one of the values not being listed exactly as it was in the list but could easily be an incomplete tag.\nOK",

However, the presentation of multiple tags without context or input for evaluation complicates assessment against the 'return just the tag' directive.\n\nSince we cannot evaluate correctness due to lack of input but must stick strictly to compliance with given instructions, and considering that typical task requirements like this would usually call for either a single answer per query or an explicitly stated exception (like an example set which wasn't indicated here), it leans towards non-compliance based on the straightforward interpretation of 'just the tag' as one tag per evaluation.\n\nERR",

Given this ambiguity, it is clear that the chatbot's output includes elements (the asterisk and multiple unrelated part of speech tags) that are not directly aligned with the description.\n\nThe most direct non-compliance, however, stems from the return of multiple tags without an explicit instruction on how to interpret them in relation to the input (which we cannot see), suggesting a complexity or ambiguity not covered by the provided instructions. Thus, considering the requirement for the chatbot to return \"just the tag for the word's part of speech,\" this output is non-compliant due to its lack of conformity with the specified format and the inclusion of irrelevant information.\n\nERR",

Nonetheless, considering the literal interpretation of the description which focuses on returning \"just the tag\" without specifying how to handle multiple words, and given that some of these could be valid tags according to the provided list (like NN for noun, VB for verb, JJ for adjective, RB for adverb), there is no clear violation based solely on the output format regarding the possible tags.

Given that all the tags provided (NN, VB, JJ, RB) are indeed from the list of acceptable tags as per the description, there doesn't seem to be a clear violation based on known rules except possibly for the issue of returning multiple tags which isn't explicitly disallowed by having access only to output and description. \nHowever considering \"Return only the part of speech tag\" literally means one tag is expected but without knowing if the task expects handling of one word or can include more than one, this still leaves ambiguity.\nERR",

However, none of these conditions are visible in this output as all lines seem to correspond to known part-of-speech tags from the provided list.\n\nSince each line appears to follow the format specified by using one of the predefined tags without any extra information and no signs of Unknown or CantAnswer which could indicate an inability to tag a word, it seems to comply with the rules that do not require knowing the input. The only potential issue is \"JJNNP\" which might seem like two tags combined (JJ for Adjective and NNP for Proper noun, singular), but given the rest of the output follows the expected single-tag-per-line format strictly as described, this could indicate either a tagging error or an attempt to convey compound information not clearly addressed by the description.\n\nHowever, since \"JJNNP\" does indeed represent two recognized part-of-speech tags from the list provided (albeit in a manner not explicitly covered by the description for a single word's output), and considering we are evaluating compliance with the given rules which emphasize the use of these specific tags without a clear directive on handling potential combinations or errors within this context, it presents a situation where strict adherence to described formats may be compromised but still attempts to utilize recognized tags.\n\nGiven this analysis, the critical aspect is determining whether \"JJNNP\" violates the spirit of the instruction to return \"just the tag for the word's part of speech.\" Since each line otherwise seems to adhere strictly to returning a single recognized tag per line as instructed and no clear guidance on handling potential compound tags or errors in tagging is provided, making an evaluation based solely on explicit compliance with the description without assuming intent not clearly stated becomes complex.\n\nThe main question here revolves around how to interpret \"JJNNP\" - as an error because it suggests more than one tag for what seems to be a single output line, potentially indicating either a compound word's parts of speech or a failure in the tagging process. The instructions do not explicitly cover such cases, leaving ambiguity in evaluation.\n\nConsidering these points and focusing on direct compliance without speculation regarding intent or unseen input, we evaluate based solely on adherence to explicit rules provided, acknowledging an apparent deviation with \"JJNNP\" but recognizing all other outputs directly match predefined tags as instructed.\n\nOK",

The only potential issue is \"JJNNP\" which might seem like two tags combined (JJ for Adjective and NNP for Proper noun, singular), but given the rest of the output follows the expected single-tag-per-line format strictly as described, this could indicate either a tagging error or an attempt to convey compound information not clearly addressed by the description.\n\nHowever, since \"JJNNP\" does indeed represent two recognized part-of-speech tags from the list provided (albeit in a manner not explicitly covered by the description for a single word's output), and considering we are evaluating compliance with the given rules which emphasize the use of these specific tags without a clear directive on handling potential combinations or errors within this context, it presents a situation where strict adherence to described formats may be compromised but still attempts to utilize recognized tags.\n\nGiven this analysis, the critical aspect is determining whether \"JJNNP\" violates the spirit of the instruction to return \"just the tag for the word's part of speech.\" Since each line otherwise seems to adhere strictly to returning a single recognized tag per line as instructed and no clear guidance on handling potential compound tags or errors in tagging is provided, making an evaluation based solely on explicit compliance with the description without assuming intent not clearly stated becomes complex.\n\nThe main question here revolves around how to interpret \"JJNNP\" - as an error because it suggests more than one tag for what seems to be a single output line, potentially indicating either a compound word's parts of speech or a failure in the tagging process. The instructions do not explicitly cover such cases, leaving ambiguity in evaluation.\n\nConsidering these points and focusing on direct compliance without speculation regarding intent or unseen input, we evaluate based solely on adherence to explicit rules provided, acknowledging an apparent deviation with \"JJNNP\" but recognizing all other outputs directly match predefined tags as instructed.\n\nOK",

However, strictly adhering to the guidelines provided for evaluation which emphasize checking for compliance rather than correctness, and recognizing the description asks for \"just the tag for the word's part of speech\", any inclusion of non-tag elements (like symbols) could be seen as not directly complying with this request because it introduces elements not defined within the set of acceptable tags.\n\nGiven these considerations and focusing strictly on the format and content compliance without speculating about the input or correctness, one might argue there's a violation due to the unconventional formatting that includes non-tag characters.

The presence of two tags in the chatbot's output (\"JJ JJ\") does not comply with this implication because it suggests multiple identifiers are being returned instead of a single identifier as the description seems to mandate.\n\nGiven the information provided and focusing on compliance rather than correctness, the output \"JJ JJ\" could be seen as not adhering strictly to the format implied by the task description which seems to expect a singular tag for a word's part of speech. Therefore, I conclude there is non-compliance based on the expectation of a single response.\n\nERR",

The description specifically states \"Return only the part of speech tag\" which is not entirely followed here as the word \"to\" is also given but since we don't know if \"to\" can be classified under \"EX\", this might comply with another rule that allows returning a tag even if it's associated with an example.\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, the provided tags do mention \"TO: to\" which suggests \"to\" should be tagged as \"TO\" not \"EX\". This discrepancy implies a potential misunderstanding or misexecution of the tagging rules.

The description asks for just the tag which was not adhered to strictly because of the colon and additional word. Considering strict format adherence is key here, the description's demand for \"only the part of speech tag\" stands somewhat compromised.\n\nStill focusing solely on direct and explicit compliance without speculating about correctness regarding the input or its relation to given tags: \nThe final output in terms of compliance strictly based on what was provided does lean towards a violation because it doesn't follow the instruction to return \"just the tag\".

However, upon closer examination, it appears that each line is providing a different possible part of speech for the word \"The\" rather than providing multiple tags in one line. This could be seen as an attempt to provide information about different possibilities for the word. Nonetheless, there's no explicit indication in the description that allows or forbids this format when there are multiple potential parts of speech for a single word.\n\nHowever, considering that the task asks to \"Return only the part of speech tag\" for a given word and includes options like \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, and \"CantAnswer\" if unable to tag the word, it seems more aligned with expecting a single answer or an indication that it can't be determined rather than multiple possibilities. Since each line provides one tag as instructed, but does so in a manner that implies multiple answers for a single word without clear guidance from the description on how such cases should be handled, this might seem compliant at first glance because it doesn't explicitly violate any rule regarding the format of providing tags.\n\nThe critical compliance issue here is not about the number of lines or the presentation of multiple possibilities but whether the chatbot adheres to the provided list of part-of-speech tags and the instruction to return \"just the tag\" for a word. The output does use recognized tags from the list provided in the description (CC, IN, VBZ), which suggests an understanding and application of the task's requirements as far as tag selection is concerned.\n\nGiven these considerations and focusing strictly on compliance without evaluating correctness or the appropriateness of the tags for the unseen input word \"The\", it appears that while there might be ambiguity in how multiple potential parts of speech are presented, each line does return a single part-of-speech tag as instructed. The essence of the task seems to be about recognizing and applying the specified part-of-speech tags correctly rather than handling cases where a word might fit into more than one category.\n\nTherefore, considering that the primary instruction is about returning a valid part-of-speech tag or indicating inability to do so, and acknowledging the complexity introduced by multiple potential answers for a single word without explicit guidance on presentation in such scenarios, it could be reasoned that this output does technically comply with the basic requirement of providing recognized part-of-speech tags.\n\nOK",

The description states that the chatbot should return just the tag for the word's part of speech. However, it lists multiple words with different parts of speech tags which seems to be a violation since we do not know if all these words were in the input sentence or if only one was supposed to be tagged.\n\nGiven this information and considering the fact that we cannot verify whether the given output corresponds to a single word contained in an input sentence due to lack of said input, it's still clear from the chatbot description that for each given word in a task the chatbot must provide its part-of-speech tag. In case where multiple words are provided, the output should ideally list tags corresponding to each of the given words or clearly indicate which tag corresponds to which word if they are different. The current format could be seen as ambiguous without knowing how many words were supposed to have their parts of speech identified.\n\nThe format also does not explicitly match the expected simple return of a part-of-speech tag for a single word, suggesting an inconsistency with the task description assuming each task involves one word. However, since we do not know if this is a case of multiple words being queried at once (which would not be against the rules but might suggest the need for clearer formatting), and given that all listed tags (VBD, VBZ, RB) are among the acceptable part-of-speech tags provided in the description, there isn't a clear violation based on tag values alone.\n\nBut to stick strictly with the instruction of checking compliance without assuming the input or the chatbot's interpretation of its task beyond what is given: The critical point here might actually be the implication that multiple words could have been requested at once which the format seems to suggest but does not clearly resolve against the given instructions. Still, looking closely at what can be evaluated directly from the output and the provided task description without assuming more than we are given, there's no explicit rule against providing tags for multiple words in one response if that was the intention (which again, would imply an omission of clarity regarding how such scenarios should be formatted).\n\nHowever, a crucial aspect to note here is the instruction that only the part of speech tag should be returned. Given this statement and considering we're working under the assumption of evaluating compliance rather than correctness or suitability for a presumed singular input: if multiple words were being evaluated in one go (and thus implying an extension or particular interpretation of the task instructions), providing distinct tags for what seems to be different parts of speech could align with returning \"the tag\" for each word's part of speech, depending on how one interprets \"the tag\" and the scenario presented.\n\nConsidering these points and recognizing that we're limited by not knowing if this represents a response to a query about multiple words (which might imply an allowed exception or need for clarification in formatting) versus an error in either understanding or presenting the task output according to the provided instructions, and strictly focusing on direct compliance without assuming what was input or intended beyond the explicit details given:\n\nERR",

Given this statement and considering we're working under the assumption of evaluating compliance rather than correctness or suitability for a presumed singular input: if multiple words were being evaluated in one go (and thus implying an extension or particular interpretation of the task instructions), providing distinct tags for what seems to be different parts of speech could align with returning \"the tag\" for each word's part of speech, depending on how one interprets \"the tag\" and the scenario presented.\n\nConsidering these points and recognizing that we're limited by not knowing if this represents a response to a query about multiple words (which might imply an allowed exception or need for clarification in formatting) versus an error in either understanding or presenting the task output according to the provided instructions, and strictly focusing on direct compliance without assuming what was input or intended beyond the explicit details given:\n\nERR",
