  "complianceText": "The chatbot description requires the output to be a single part of speech tag. However, the chatbot output contains two tags 'JJ' which indicates that the word can have more than one tag but according to the description, the chatbot should return only one tag for the word's part of speech. The fact that the same tag is repeated does not change this - it is still multiple items rather than a single item as required by the description. Therefore I conclude that this output is in violation of the provided description.\n\nERR"
