In this case, the output is 'VBP' which is a valid part of speech tag according to the provided list. However, there are two identical tags separated by 'and'. This seems unnecessary as the description asks for just one tag. Nevertheless, both outputs 'VBP' are individually valid and comply with the given part of speech tags. The issue here might be that it does not follow the instruction of returning \"just the tag\" when multiple are given but since VBP is a correct tag there's no error regarding the type of output.\n\nOK"
