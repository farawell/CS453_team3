  "complianceText": "The chatbot output appears to be a list of part-of-speech tags, which are specified in the description as the expected format for the response. The description lists an alphabetical list of part-of-speech tags that can be used, and the chatbot's output includes some of these tags: NN (Noun, singular or mass), JJ (Adjective), and CC (Coordinating conjunction). The chatbot is returning only the part of speech tag for each word as required. There are multiple lines of output but this does not violate the description, since the description does not specify that there must be a single line of output. Therefore, I conclude that the chatbot's output complies with the provided description, except for the fact that we do not know if these are correct tags without knowing the input.\nOK"
