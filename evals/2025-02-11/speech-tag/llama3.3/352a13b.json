According to the description, the chatbot should return just the tag for the word's part of speech. In this case, the chatbot returns \"JJ\" which is one of the listed tags, and it does so after providing a list of words with their respective tags, but the key point here is that it does indeed provide a single tag as the final answer. \n\nOK"
