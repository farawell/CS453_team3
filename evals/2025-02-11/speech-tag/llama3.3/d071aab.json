The tags provided (CC for \"and\", VBG for \"struggling\", and VBN for \"frustrated\") are among the listed tags in the description, indicating compliance with the specified alphabetical list of part-of-speech tags. There is no indication of returning \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" when it was not applicable, suggesting that the chatbot made an attempt to tag each word and did so within the constraints provided. Therefore, based on the information given and adhering strictly to the guidelines without considering correctness due to lack of input, the output seems to comply with the description provided.\n\nOK"
