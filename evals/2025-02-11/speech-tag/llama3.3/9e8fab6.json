In this case, \"CC\" is a valid part-of-speech tag according to the provided list, which represents a Coordinating conjunction. The word \"and\" is indeed a coordinating conjunction, but since we do not have the input sentence, we cannot verify if it is correctly tagged. However, based on the given output alone and the fact that it returns a tag as required, there's no clear violation of the description's requirements regarding the format of the output.\n\nOK"
