This suggests that the output is directly related to one of the allowed tags mentioned in the description. Since \"VB\" directly matches one of the specified part-of-speech tags provided and does not contain any additional information beyond what is expected (such as returning only the part of speech tag), it seems to comply with the description's requirements for format and content.\n\nOK"
