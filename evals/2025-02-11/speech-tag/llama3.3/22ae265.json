  "complianceText": "The chatbot output appears to be a list of words with their corresponding part-of-speech tags, as required by the description. Each line of the output follows the format of \"word is a tag\", which suggests that it is attempting to identify the part of speech for each given word. The tags used (JJ, VBG, CC, NN, VBZ) are all present in the list of allowed tags provided in the description. There is no extra information or deviation from the expected format that would indicate non-compliance with the description. Therefore, based on the provided output and the rules that can be checked without knowing the input, it seems that the chatbot is following the required format.\n\nOK"
