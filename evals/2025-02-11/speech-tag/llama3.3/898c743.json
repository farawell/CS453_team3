Each word has a tag assigned to it, and all the tags are from the list provided in the description. There is no extra information provided that could potentially cause non-compliance. Since the output only contains part-of-speech tags for each word without any additional text or explanation, and since these tags are directly mentioned in the chatbot's description as acceptable, it appears to follow the specified format without including any irrelevant information.\n\nOK"
