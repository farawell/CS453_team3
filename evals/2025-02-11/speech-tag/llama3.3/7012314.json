  "complianceText": "The chatbot output consists of two separate parts of speech tags: VBN and JJ. The description specifies that the chatbot should return just the tag for the word's part of speech, and lists the possible tags, which include VBN (Verb, past participle) and JJ (Adjective). Since both VBN and JJ are valid tags according to the provided list, it seems the chatbot is returning multiple parts of speech, but it does not explicitly violate any rule as there is no information if these two outputs are for one word or for two different words. \nOK"
