  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is \"CC: The\". The description requires the chatbot to return only the part of speech tag, but in this case, it returns both the tag and the word. According to the description, the correct output should be just the tag, such as \"CC\" if \"The\" is indeed a coordinating conjunction, which seems incorrect because \"The\" is typically a determiner. However, the main issue here is that the chatbot returned both the tag and the word instead of just the tag.\n\nERR"
