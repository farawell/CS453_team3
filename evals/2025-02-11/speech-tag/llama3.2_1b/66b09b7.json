According to the description provided between <DESC> and </DESC>, the chatbot should return just the tag for the word's part of speech if it can be tagged with one of the listed tags, or \"Unknown\" if it cannot be tagged, or \"CantAnswer\" if unable to tag. The output \"Crawl: VB\" does include a part-of-speech tag, which is \"VB\", indicating a verb in its base form. However, the description specifies that only the part-of-speech tag should be returned, not the word itself. Therefore, including the word \"Crawl\" along with its tag \"VB\" does not comply with the instruction to return \"just the tag for the word's part of speech\".\n\nERR"
