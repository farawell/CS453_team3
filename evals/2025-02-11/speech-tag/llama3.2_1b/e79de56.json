The description states that if you are unable to tag the word, return \"CantAnswer\". However, in this case, the chatbot has provided a part of speech tag \"CC\", indicating that it was able to tag the word. This contradicts the presence of \"CantAnswer\" which is supposed to be returned when the chatbot is unable to tag the word.\n\nERR"
