  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains two different values, \"CC: The\" and \"CantAnswer\". According to the description, if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, return Unknown, and if you are unable to tag the word, return CantAnswer. However, it seems like the chatbot has provided both a part of speech tag \"CC\" for the word \"The\", which is correct according to the list of part-of-speech tags provided in the description, and also \"CantAnswer\". This suggests that the chatbot is providing multiple responses instead of a single response as described. \n\nERR"
