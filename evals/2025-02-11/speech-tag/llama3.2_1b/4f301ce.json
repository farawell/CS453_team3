According to the chatbot description, if the chatbot is able to tag a word with one of the provided tags it should return just the tag. However, in this case, it returns both the tag and the word, and then also \"CantAnswer\" which seems to indicate an inability to answer, but since it did provide a tag for the word \"The\", returning \"CantAnswer\" afterwards does not comply with the description.\n\nERR"
