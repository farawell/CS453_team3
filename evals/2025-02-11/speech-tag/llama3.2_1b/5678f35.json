  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description because it returns multiple parts of speech tags for a given word, along with examples and explanations, whereas the description states to return only the part of speech tag. Additionally, some of the abbreviations used in the output, such as WBZ and PBS, do not match any of thetags listed in the description. The output also seems to provide extra information by including the word \"noun\" after CD, which is not in line with the requirement to return just the tag for the word's part of speech.\n\nERR"
