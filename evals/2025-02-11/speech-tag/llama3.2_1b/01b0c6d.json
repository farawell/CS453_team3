  "complianceText": "The chatbot output \"CC: The\" suggests that the word \"The\" is being tagged with a part of speech, specifically as a coordinating conjunction, which is denoted by the tag \"CC\". However, according to the description provided, the chatbot should only return the part of speech tag. In this case, the output includes both the tag and the word itself. Therefore, I conclude that there is a violation because the output does not match the expected format of returning just the tag.\n\nERR"
