  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description because it contains a tag 'RS' which is not listed in the given part-of-speech tags. The thinking process behind this conclusion is that I carefully examined each part of speech tag provided by the chatbot and checked if they are present in the list of allowed tags, I found 'RS: Adverb of manner' which is not mentioned anywhere in the description. This extra tag led me to conclude that a rule was violated.\n\nERR"
