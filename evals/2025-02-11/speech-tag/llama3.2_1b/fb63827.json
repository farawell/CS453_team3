  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output 'CD: Cardinal number' seems to be following the description as it is returning a part of speech tag which is in the list provided in the task description. The task mentions that if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, return Unknown and if unable to tag the word, return CantAnswer but since CD is one of the listed tags this rule does not apply here. Also, it is returning only the part of speech tag as required by the task.\n\nOK"
