The description states to return only the part of speech tag. If the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, return Unknown. If you are unable to tag the word, return CantAnswer. However, the output provided contains a colon and a number, as well as a combination of two potential parts of speech in parentheses, which does not directly match any of the specified return values.\n\nERR"
