  "complianceText": "The given chatbot output is \"DEP\". According to the provided description, the output should be one of the listed part-of-speech tags or \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, or \"CantAnswer\" if unable to tag the word. The tag \"DEP\" is not mentioned in the list of allowed part-of-speech tags. My reasoning leads me to conclude that since \"DEP\" does not match any of the specified tags, it violates the rule of returning a valid part-of-speech tag as defined in the description.\n\nERR"
