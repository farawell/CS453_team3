  "complianceText": "The chatbot output 'Pronoun: Unknown' seems to be trying to follow the description by providing a part of speech tag but does so in an incorrect format as per the given instructions. The instructions specify that only the tag should be returned if it can be determined, otherwise 'Unknown' or 'CantAnswer'. However, here the chatbot has prefixed its output with 'Pronoun: ', which is not following the instruction to return 'just the tag for the word's part of speech'. Since 'Pronoun' does not directly map onto one of the specified tags and considering 'Unknown' as a valid response in cases where the word cannot be tagged, it still fails to adhere strictly to the format due to the prefix. Therefore, my conclusion is that there is non-compliance with the given description due to the addition of unnecessary text.\n\nERR"
