According to the description, the chatbot should return \"just the tag for the word's part of speech\" which implies a single tag per word without any additional information or prefixes like \"CC:\", \"NP:\", or \"JJ:\". The presence of these prefixes and the word before each colon suggests that the output might be detailed but does not comply with the instruction to return \"just the tag\". \n\nERR"
