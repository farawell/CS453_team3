  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output appears to be a list of words from the input sentence with their corresponding parts of speech tags. Based on the description, it seems that the chatbot is supposed to return only the part of speech tag for a given word. However, in this case, the chatbot has provided multiple words with their tags.\n\nOne potential issue here is that the chatbot output does not match the expected format described in the task description. The task requires returning just the tag for the word's part of speech. But since I do not know which word was supposed to be tagged and it seems like the chatbot has provided multiple words with their tags, this rule cannot be checked.\n\nHowever another potential issue is that there are some parts of the description which can still be evaluated without knowing the input, for example if any unknown or unrecognizable tag is used. Here in the output CC, UH, NN, JJR and VBD all seem to be legitimate tags as per the given list. \n\nGiven this information I am going to decide that there is no compliance issue with rules which do not require knowing the input.\nOK"
