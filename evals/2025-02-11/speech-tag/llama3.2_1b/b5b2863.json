The given tags in the output are 'N' and 'NN'. According to the description 'N' is not a valid part-of-speech tag but 'NN' is a valid tag which stands for Noun, singular or mass. However since there are two separate values provided instead of one it could potentially be indicating multiple possible parts of speech, yet this does not directly comply with returning just the tag as requested.\n\nERR"
