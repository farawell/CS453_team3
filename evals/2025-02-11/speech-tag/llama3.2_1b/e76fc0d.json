However, there seems to be an issue with the format and content of some of these tags. The description provides a specific set of allowable tags, including CC, which is correctly used here, but \"NTS\" does not match any of the specified tags in the description. This indicates a potential violation because \"NTS\" is not listed among the allowed part-of-speech tags.\n\nERR"
