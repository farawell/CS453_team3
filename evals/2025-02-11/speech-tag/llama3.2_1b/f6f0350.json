  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output provides two different part-of-speech tags for the same word \"The\". According to the description, the chatbot should return just the tag for the word's part of speech. However, the output contains multiple tags which seems like the chatbot is providing more than one possible part of speech for a single word. This directly goes against the provided description where it asks to return only the part of speech tag.\n\nERR"
