  "complianceText": "The chatbot output appears to be a list of words with a part-of-speech tag, which is allowed according to the description. However, upon closer inspection, I notice that there are multiple values being returned, including \"The\", \"bird\", and \"birds\", along with a part-of-speech tag that seems incomplete or incorrect because it does not match any word in particular but just one value CC. According to the description, the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag for a given word, such as \"CC\" without any additional words like \"The\", \"bird\", and \"birds\". The presence of multiple words along with a single part-of-speech tag suggests non-compliance with this specific instruction.\n\nERR"
