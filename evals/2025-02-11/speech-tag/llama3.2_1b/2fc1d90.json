  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is \"CC: sentence\". To evaluate this output against the description provided, we need to check if it complies with the rules specified for part-of-speech tagging. The description states that the chatbot should return just the tag for the word's part of speech or specific values like Unknown or CantAnswer under certain conditions. However, in this case, the chatbot has returned \"CC: sentence\", which includes the part-of-speech tag \"CC\" but also includes additional text \": sentence\". The description does not specify that the output should include a colon and then an example sentence. It only mentions returning the part of speech tag or one of the specific values mentioned. Therefore, this output seems to be providing more information than requested by the description.\n\nERR"
