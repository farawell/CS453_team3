  "complianceText": "The given chatbot output provides two different part-of-speech tags with their descriptions, which are 'NS: Noun' and 'NSP: Proper noun'. However, according to the description provided between the delimiters <DESC> and </DESC>, the Alphabetical list of part-of-speech tags used in this task does not include 'NS' or 'NSP' as valid tags. The valid noun-related tags mentioned are NN for Noun, singular or mass, NNS for Noun, plural, NNP for Proper noun, singular, and NNPS for Proper noun, plural.\n\nGiven the information provided in the description, the output seems to be using non-standard part-of-speech tags not listed in the task's guidelines. This discrepancy suggests that the chatbot's output does not comply with the specified list of part-of-speech tags as described in the task.\n\nERR"
