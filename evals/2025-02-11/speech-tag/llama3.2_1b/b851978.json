According to the provided description, both \"CC\" and \"JJS\" are valid part-of-speech tags. The description does not specify that the chatbot's output should be a single tag, but rather it lists the possible tags that can be returned. Since \"CC\" is a coordinating conjunction and \"JJS\" is an adjective, superlative, and both are among the listed tags, I do not see any violation of the description.\n\nOK"
