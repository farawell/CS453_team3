  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provided is \"CC: The door is open and welcoming\". Upon examining this output, I notice that it includes a part of speech tag \"CC\", which according to the description, stands for Coordinating conjunction. However, following the tag, there's a sentence \"The door is open and welcoming\" instead of just the tag. According to the chatbot description, it should return \"only the part of speech tag\". The presence of the additional sentence after the tag violates this rule.\n\nERR"
