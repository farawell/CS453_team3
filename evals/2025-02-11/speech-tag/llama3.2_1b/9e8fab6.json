  "complianceText": "The chatbot description requires the output to be just the tag for the word's part of speech, but in this case, we see that each line contains a tag followed by a colon and what appears to be an example or clarification. This does not comply with the instruction to return only the part of speech tag. The inclusion of additional information after the tags (e.g., \": to\", \": amazing\", \": stars\", \": the\") suggests that the chatbot is providing more than just the tag, which violates the description's requirement for a straightforward and simple output.\n\nERR"
