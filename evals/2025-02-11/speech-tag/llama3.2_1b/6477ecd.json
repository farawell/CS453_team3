  "complianceText": "The given output seems to have provided a part of speech tag which is \"CC\" and also mentions \"Unknown\". According to the description, if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, return Unknown. If we ignore the fact that it requires knowing the input to determine whether the correct tag was applied or not, this output does seem to comply as it provides a part of speech tag which matches one in the provided list and also mentions \"Unknown\" which is also in accordance with the description.\n\nHowever there seems to be a problem here. It appears to have provided both a specific tag (CC) alongside stating \"Unknown\", this could indicate non compliance because according to the description, one should return just the part of speech tag, or if it cannot be tagged then return \"Unknown\" but not both at the same time.\n\nConsidering these factors I conclude that the output seems to partly comply with the provided description and partly does not. Therefore there is a need to err on this violation because it did provide both a specific tag alongside stating Unknown and the rules seem to indicate it should be one or the other.\n\nERR"
