  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output includes \"DT\" which is a valid part-of-speech tag according to the description, and it also includes \":C\" along with \"(Calibrated based on the sentence structure)\" which seems like an explanation or additional information. However, the description states that only the part of speech tag should be returned. The inclusion of extra information beyond just the tag could potentially be seen as non-compliance because the format provided in the output does not strictly adhere to returning \"just the tag for the word's part of speech\" as instructed.\n\nERR"
