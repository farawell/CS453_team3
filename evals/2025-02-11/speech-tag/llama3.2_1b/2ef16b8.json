  "complianceText": "Given the chatbot description, it specifies that only the part of speech tag should be returned for the given word. However, in this case, the output includes both the tag \"NNS\" and the word \"babies\". According to the description, if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, return Unknown, and if you are unable to tag the word, return CantAnswer. But here, it seems the chatbot has successfully identified the part of speech as \"NNS\", which stands for Noun, plural. The issue is that the output also includes the word itself, not just the tag.\n\nThe description explicitly states that the response should be just the tag for the word's part of speech. Therefore, including the word \"babies\" in the output does not comply with this instruction. \n\nERR"
