However, the description specifies that the output should be one of the listed tags, such as NN for noun, singular or mass, or other specific tags like VB for verb, base form, etc. The output \"N N\" does not match any single tag provided in the description and also seems to have an extra space which might indicate two separate tags but the description asks for a single tag for a given word.\n\nERR"
