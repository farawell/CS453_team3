  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is \"Determination\" which does not match any of the specified part-of-speech tags provided in the description, such as CC, CD, DT, EX, FW, IN, JJ, JJR, JJS, LS, MD, NN, NNS, NNP, NNPS, PDT, POS, PRP, PRP$, RB, RBR, RBS, RP, SYM, TO, UH, VB, VBD, VBG, VBN, VBP, VBZ, WDT, WP, WP$, or WRB. The output seems to be a word itself rather than a part-of-speech tag. According to the description, if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, it should return \"Unknown\" and if unable to tag the word, it should return \"CantAnswer\". Since \"Determination\" is not one of these specified return values, it does not comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
