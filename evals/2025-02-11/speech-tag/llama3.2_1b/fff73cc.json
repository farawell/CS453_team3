According to the description, all tags are unique and there is no tag named JJJ. The description lists the available tags as CC, CD, DT, EX, FW, IN, JJ, JJR, JJS, LS, MD, NN, NNS, NNP, NNPS, PDT, POS, PRP, PRP$, RB, RBR, RBS, RP, SYM, TO, UH, VB, VBD, VBG, VBN, VBP, VBZ, WDT, WP, WP$, and WRB. Since JJJ is not in this list and it also does not match the special cases of Unknown or CantAnswer, I conclude that there is a violation.\n\nERR"
