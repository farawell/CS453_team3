  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description because it is supposed to return just the tag for the word's part of speech, but instead returns a list of parts of speech with examples. The description requires a single part-of-speech tag to be returned, such as CC, JJ, NN, etc. However, the chatbot output provides multiple tags and also includes explanations or examples for each tag, which is not in line with the provided description. Furthermore, some of the tags used, like CDD, are not even listed in the provided part-of-speech tags. The output format does not match the expected format as described.\n\nERR"
