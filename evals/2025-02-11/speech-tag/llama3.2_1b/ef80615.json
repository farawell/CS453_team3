  "output": "CC: To answer this question, I would tag the sentence as \"PRP$: Wh-pronoun\".\n\nReasoning:\n- The word 'new' is a determiner making it PRP:.\n- The word 'exciting' is an adjective describing the noun 'day', so I would tag it as JJR: Adjective.\n- The phrase 'in this task' is a preposition and not within the sentence we're examining, but for clarity, I've left a bracket [ ] to indicate its position. No further tagging applicable here.\n\nRemaining Word: day",
