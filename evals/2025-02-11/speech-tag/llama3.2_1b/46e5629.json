However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the format of the output does not fully comply with the description provided, as the description asks to return only the part of speech tag for a given word. The presence of additional descriptive text after each tag (e.g., \": The stars\", \": celestial\", etc.) and the inclusion of explanations or justifications (e.g., \"(modifying 'shining')\") suggest that the output is providing more information than what is requested. Furthermore, the appearance of \"ADJP: heavenly\" indicates a tag not listed in the provided description, which explicitly defines the set of acceptable part-of-speech tags.\n\nERR"
