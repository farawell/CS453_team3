### Overview

<details><summary>Glossary</summary>
    
- Prompt Under Test (PUT) - like Program Under Test; the prompt
- Model Under Test (MUT) - Model which we are testing against with specific temperature, etc example: gpt-4o-mini
- Model Used by PromptPex (MPP) - gpt-4o

- Input Specification (IS) - Extracting input constraints of PUT using MPP
- Output Rules (OR) - Extracting output constraints of PUT using MPP
- Output Rules Groundedness (ORG) - Checks if OR is grounded in PUT using MPP

- Prompt Under Test Intent (PUTI) - Extracting the exact task from PUT using MMP

- PromptPex Tests (PPT) - Test cases generated for PUT with MPP using IS and OR
- Baseline Tests (BT) - Zero shot test cases generated for PUT with MPP

- Test Input Compliance (TIC) - Checking if PPT and BT meets the constraints in IS using MPP
- Test Coverage (TC) - Result generated for PPT and BT on PUTI + OR with MPP

- Test Output (TO) - Result generated for PPT and BT on PUT with each MUT
- Test Output ComplianceÂ (TOC) - Checking if TO meets the constraints in PUT using MPP

Here are the detailed steps taken:<br><br>1\. \*\*Understanding the Function of Each Word:\*\*<br>   \- Words can serve different roles such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions, or interjections\.<br>   \- Context is crucial in determining the correct part of speech\.<br><br>2\. \*\*Analyzing Example Sentences:\*\*<br>   \- For example, the word "together" in "They played together" functions as an adverb \(RB\) because it describes how they played\.<br>   \- The word "fast" can function as an adjective \(JJ\) when describing a car moving quickly or as a verb \(VB\) when referring to fasting\.<br><br>3\. \*\*Considering Idiomatic Expressions and Common Phrases:\*\*<br>   \- Words like "on" in "She put her book on the table" function as prepositions \(IN\)\.<br>   \- The word "as" can function as a conjunction \(IN\) in comparative constructions\.<br><br>4\. \*\*Verbs and Their Forms:\*\*<br>   \- Identifying verb forms based on tense and subject, such as VB \(base form\), VBD \(past tense\), VBG \(gerund/participle\), VBN \(past participle\), VBP \(present non\-3rd person singular\), and VBZ \(3rd person singular present\)\.<br><br>5\. \*\*Less Common Tags:\*\*<br>   \- Recognizing foreign words \(FW\), possessive endings \(POS\), personal pronouns \(PRP\), and possessive pronouns \(PRP$\)\.<br><br>6\. \*\*Resolving Ambiguities:\*\*<br>   \- When a word can serve multiple roles, the context is analyzed to determine the most probable part of speech\.<br><br>After following this process for each example provided, we arrive at the conclusion that the final answer is \\boxed\{B\}\.|err|

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs to provide more information about how something occurs\. In this case, "softly" modifies the verb "playing," indicating a manner of performance\.<br><br>The tag assigned is RB \(Adverb\) due to its function in the sentence, qualifying the action described by the verb\. It fits the definition as it does not compare actions or describe a degree beyond what is inherent to the single instance of the action, thus excluding comparative and superlative classifications that would be tagged as RBR and RBS respectively\.<br><br>Similarly, "background" functions as a noun in this sentence referring to an abstract or physical space where music can ostensibly play\. It's singular \(NN\) because it denotes one entity \- the backdrop against which other actions or events occur\. The use of NN rather than NNS is important for noting that we're not discussing multiple separate entities here but a single collective concept\.<br><br>This detailed analysis helps demonstrate why these specific POS tags are assigned and highlights how context influences word function in sentences\.|ok|

Part\-2 \- Implement a multi\-layer perceptron model to solve the classification problem of digits \(0\-9\) from MNIST dataset using back\-propagation algorithm\.<br>     \* For part 2, I'll be following code snippets provided by Prof during class for various steps like initialization and feed forward as explained in assignment document\. Hence my file will not have the complete implementation but rather an approach to solve it\.<br><br>   \*\*The structure of my program :\*\*<br>   <br>   We are using 4 classes one of each :<br>   <br>   \* Network: Class that performs all network operations, i\.e\., initialization with random weights and biases, forward propagation, backward propagations etc\.<br>   \* Layer: Class for layer object\. It holds the neurons/weights/biases for any specific level\.<br>   \* Activation: Base class for different kinds of activation functions that we can perform\.<br>       We can derive some classes to this base one which are used later in code according to need, e\.g, sigmoid, tanh etc\.<br>   \* TrainTestSplit : Class for splitting the dataset into train and test as well as preprocessing them if required\. It inherits from Activation class because all activation functions needs to be applied before training on any layer\.<br><br>Note: I have written a lot of comments in code so that it's easier to understand what exactly is happening at every step\.<br>      <br>   \*\*Code snippets\*\* :<br><br>    \`\`\`py<br>    \# For this assignment we are not using Keras instead using plain tensorflow with some help from numpy and sklearn\.<br>    \# Importing required libraries<br>    import tensorflow as tf<br>    from helperFunctions import \*<br>    import pandas as pd<br>    import matplotlib\.pyplot<br><br><br>       \# Network class that holds methods needed for different training stages in neural nerwork<br>    <br>    class network\(object\):<br>    <br>        def \_\_init\_\_\(self, layers, epochs=1, learningRate = 0\.01\):<br>            self\.layers = layers<br>            self\.learning\_rate = learningRate<br>            self\.weights, self\.biases = initialize\(self\.layers\)<br>\`\`\`<br>   <br>   \`\`\`py<br>       \# This function for forward propagation as it helps us calculate activations using each layer's weight and biases\.<br>    def feedForward\(trainInputs\):<br><br>        numLayers = len\(layers\) \# Number of layers from user input<br><br>        \# Iterate through all provided inputs using the above calculated values to provide output activation from every layer\.<br><br>        activations = trainInputs<br>        prevActivated=trainInputs<br>        for i in range\(numLayers\):<br>            layerValue = tf\.matmul\(activations, self\.weights\[i\]\) \+self\.biases\[i\]<br>            \# Calculating layer's value as dot product of it's weights with previously provided activated value and adding bias\.<br>            \# Activating the value using required activation function \(sigmoid here\)\.<br>            <br>            activations=sigmoid\(layerValue\)  \# Activated values by sigmoid<br>            print\("Activation ",i, " : ", activations\[0\]\[:5\]\) \#Printing some values for debugging purposes<br>            <br>            prevActivated=activations <br>        return \[activations,prevActivated\] \`\`\`<br><br>    \`\`\`py<br>        \#This function implements back propagation as discussed in course\.<br><br>    def backwardPropagation\(yTrue,yPrediction,sample\):<br>    <br>        predictions = self\.feedForward\(sample\)<br>        numLayers=len\(self\.layers\)<br>        lossGradient=None<br>        <br>        for i in reversed\(range\(numLayers\)\):<br>            if\(i==numLayers\-1\): \#for output layer<br>                a0=  yPrediction \- yTrue \# Loss gradient dC/dp = p\-y; where, p = predicted value , and y = true value<br>                lossGrad=sigmoidPrime\(predictions\[0\]\) \* a0 \# dC/dz = dC/dp\*dp/dsigmoid\(z\) ; where z is linear result<br>                <br>            else: \# if its an inner layer then we do a sum of values by multiplication based on chain rule\.<br>                x=\(lossGradient\)\.dot\(self\.weights\[i\+1\]\[::\-1\]\)<br>                lossGrad=x \* sigmoidPrime\(predictions\[0\]\)<br>            <br>            gradientWeights=lossGrad\.dot\( np\.atleast\_2d\(prevActivated\[i\]\)\.T\) \# dC/dw = \(dC/dz\)\(dz/dW\), Where z is output of layer, W and b are weights/bias\.<br>            gradientBiases=np\.sum\(lossGrad,axis=1,keepdims=True\)<br>            <br>                \# Updating the gradients<br>            <br>            self\.gradientsW\[i\]=self\.gradientsW\[i\]\-gradientWeights<br>            self\.gradientsB\[i\]=self\.gradientsB\[i\]\-gradientBiases<br>        return <br>    \`\`\`<br>   <br>   \*\*Training loop\*\*:<br>    <br>    \`\`\`py<br>   <br>        \# The function below contains the steps that happens during each training and validation iteration in a particular epoch<br><br>    def train\(self, y\_true, sample, isValidation=False\): \#Function to train network based on inputs<br>    <br>        <br>            <br>        predictions=self\.feedForward\(sample\)<br>        <br><br>        if\(isValidation==False\):<br>            self\.backwardPropagation\(y\_true,predictions\[0\],sample\)  \# Train backprop only for train set\.

Part\-2 \- Implement a multi\-layer perceptron model to solve the classification problem of digits \(0\-9\) from MNIST dataset using back\-propagation algorithm\.<br>     \* For part 2, I'll be following code snippets provided by Prof during class for various steps like initialization and feed forward as explained in assignment document\. Hence my file will not have the complete implementation but rather an approach to solve it\.<br><br>   \*\*The structure of my program :\*\*<br>   <br>   We are using 4 classes one of each :<br>   <br>   \* Network: Class that performs all network operations, i\.e\., initialization with random weights and biases, forward propagation, backward propagations etc\.<br>   \* Layer: Class for layer object\. It holds the neurons/weights/biases for any specific level\.<br>   \* Activation: Base class for different kinds of activation functions that we can perform\.<br>       We can derive some classes to this base one which are used later in code according to need, e\.g, sigmoid, tanh etc\.<br>   \* TrainTestSplit : Class for splitting the dataset into train and test as well as preprocessing them if required\. It inherits from Activation class because all activation functions needs to be applied before training on any layer\.<br><br>Note: I have written a lot of comments in code so that it's easier to understand what exactly is happening at every step\.<br>      <br>   \*\*Code snippets\*\* :<br><br>    \`\`\`py<br>    \# For this assignment we are not using Keras instead using plain tensorflow with some help from numpy and sklearn\.<br>    \# Importing required libraries<br>    import tensorflow as tf<br>    from helperFunctions import \*<br>    import pandas as pd<br>    import matplotlib\.pyplot<br><br><br>       \# Network class that holds methods needed for different training stages in neural nerwork<br>    <br>    class network\(object\):<br>    <br>        def \_\_init\_\_\(self, layers, epochs=1, learningRate = 0\.01\):<br>            self\.layers = layers<br>            self\.learning\_rate = learningRate<br>            self\.weights, self\.biases = initialize\(self\.layers\)<br>\`\`\`<br>   <br>   \`\`\`py<br>       \# This function for forward propagation as it helps us calculate activations using each layer's weight and biases\.<br>    def feedForward\(trainInputs\):<br><br>        numLayers = len\(layers\) \# Number of layers from user input<br><br>        \# Iterate through all provided inputs using the above calculated values to provide output activation from every layer\.<br><br>        activations = trainInputs<br>        prevActivated=trainInputs<br>        for i in range\(numLayers\):<br>            layerValue = tf\.matmul\(activations, self\.weights\[i\]\) \+self\.biases\[i\]<br>            \# Calculating layer's value as dot product of it's weights with previously provided activated value and adding bias\.<br>            \# Activating the value using required activation function \(sigmoid here\)\.<br>            <br>            activations=sigmoid\(layerValue\)  \# Activated values by sigmoid<br>            print\("Activation ",i, " : ", activations\[0\]\[:5\]\) \#Printing some values for debugging purposes<br>            <br>            prevActivated=activations <br>        return \[activations,prevActivated\] \`\`\`<br><br>    \`\`\`py<br>        \#This function implements back propagation as discussed in course\.<br><br>    def backwardPropagation\(yTrue,yPrediction,sample\):<br>    <br>        predictions = self\.feedForward\(sample\)<br>        numLayers=len\(self\.layers\)<br>        lossGradient=None<br>        <br>        for i in reversed\(range\(numLayers\)\):<br>            if\(i==numLayers\-1\): \#for output layer<br>                a0=  yPrediction \- yTrue \# Loss gradient dC/dp = p\-y; where, p = predicted value , and y = true value<br>                lossGrad=sigmoidPrime\(predictions\[0\]\) \* a0 \# dC/dz = dC/dp\*dp/dsigmoid\(z\) ; where z is linear result<br>                <br>            else: \# if its an inner layer then we do a sum of values by multiplication based on chain rule\.<br>                x=\(lossGradient\)\.dot\(self\.weights\[i\+1\]\[::\-1\]\)<br>                lossGrad=x \* sigmoidPrime\(predictions\[0\]\)<br>            <br>            gradientWeights=lossGrad\.dot\( np\.atleast\_2d\(prevActivated\[i\]\)\.T\) \# dC/dw = \(dC/dz\)\(dz/dW\), Where z is output of layer, W and b are weights/bias\.<br>            gradientBiases=np\.sum\(lossGrad,axis=1,keepdims=True\)<br>            <br>                \# Updating the gradients<br>            <br>            self\.gradientsW\[i\]=self\.gradientsW\[i\]\-gradientWeights<br>            self\.gradientsB\[i\]=self\.gradientsB\[i\]\-gradientBiases<br>        return <br>    \`\`\`<br>   <br>   \*\*Training loop\*\*:<br>    <br>    \`\`\`py<br>   <br>        \# The function below contains the steps that happens during each training and validation iteration in a particular epoch<br><br>    def train\(self, y\_true, sample, isValidation=False\): \#Function to train network based on inputs<br>    <br>        <br>            <br>        predictions=self\.feedForward\(sample\)<br>        <br><br>        if\(isValidation==False\):<br>            self\.backwardPropagation\(y\_true,predictions\[0\],sample\)  \# Train backprop only for train set\.

|The dog is very happy|ok|The given input is "The dog is very happy"\. To determine if this complies with the provided input specification, we need to check two main things: <br>1\) If it contains a sentence and <br>2\) If it contains a word that is part of the sentence\.<br><br>The input "The dog is very happy" forms a complete sentence as it has a subject \(the dog\) and a predicate \(is very happy\)\. Therefore, it complies with the first requirement of containing a sentence\. <br><br>For the second requirement, we need to verify if there's a word contained within this given sentence\. Looking at the input, words like "dog", "happy" are indeed part of the sentence\. Hence, the input also satisfies the condition of having a word that is contained within the sentence\.<br><br>Given these observations and adhering strictly to the provided input specification without making assumptions or inferences beyond what's explicitly stated, we can conclude that the given input complies with all the specified requirements since it does contain both a sentence and words \(like "dog" or "happy"\) within that sentence\.<br><br>OK|1|The dog is very happy|
|The baby laughed at the clown|ok|The input specification requires that the input contains both a sentence and a word, and that the word must be contained within the given sentence\. In this case, the input "The baby laughed at the clown" appears to be a sentence but it does not explicitly contain a separate word that is indicated to be the word that must be contained within the sentence\. The specification does not specify how the sentence and the word should be differentiated or separated in the input, but it implies that both should be present\. Given this implication, it seems there might be a lack of clarity on whether the input fully meets the criteria since we cannot identify a specific word that is meant to be the contained word based solely on the provided input\. However, interpreting the specification strictly and considering the possibility that any word within the sentence could be considered "the word," then the input does comply because it contains a sentence and any of its words are technically "contained" within it\.<br><br>OK|1|The output is a list of part\-of\-speech tags corresponding to each word in the given sentence\.<br><br>DT  <br>NN  <br>VBD  <br>IN  <br>DT  <br>NN|
|The music is loud and energetic|ok|To determine if the given input complies with the provided specification, let's examine the key requirements outlined in the specification\. The input must contain a sentence and a word, where the sentence can be of any length and may include various parts of speech, punctuation marks, or special characters\. The word must be contained within the given sentence\.<br><br>The input provided is "The music is loud and energetic"\. This string serves as both a sentence due to its grammatical completeness \("The music is loud and energetic" conveys a complete thought\) and contains multiple words \("The", "music", "is", "loud", "and", "energetic"\)\. Therefore, it inherently includes sentences and words within the scope of a single, broader sentence\.<br><br>Given that any word from the sentence could be considered as fulfilling the requirement for 'a word' \(as long as we acknowledge one of the words in the sentence is indeed the required word\), the input directly complies with the provided specification\. There are no restrictions on how the sentence and word should be formatted within the input, other than that they must both exist\.<br><br>The key elements of compliance here include:<br>1\. The presence of a sentence \("The music is loud and energetic"\)\.<br>2\. The inclusion of words within this sentence \(any one or more of "The", "music", "is", "loud", "and", "energetic"\)\.<br><br>Since these conditions are met without violating any part of the specification, we conclude that the input complies with the requirements\.<br><br>OK|1|DT<br>NN<br>VBZ<br>JJ<br>CC<br>JJ|
|The grass is brown and dry|ok|To determine compliance with the input specification, I must analyze the given sentence to see if it meets all the criteria outlined in the specification\. The input specification requires that the input contains both a sentence and a word, where the word must be contained within the sentence\. <br><br>Given the input "The grass is brown and dry", this string can be considered as containing a sentence due to its grammatical structure \("The grass is brown and dry" forms a coherent and complete thought\)\. However, upon closer inspection, it's clear that the input implicitly contains multiple words \("The", "grass", "is", "brown", "and", "dry"\) which are all part of the sentence\. Therefore, the condition that the word must be contained within the given sentence is inherently met because each of these words is part of the sentence itself\.<br><br>Since there's no explicit separation or designation of a standalone word outside of the sentence in this input, one could interpret that any of the individual words \("The", "grass", etc\.\) serves as the required word contained within the sentence\. Thus, based on the given information and adhering strictly to the criteria provided without making additional assumptions, it appears that the input does indeed comply with the specification because it contains a sentence and each component word of the sentence can be seen as fulfilling the role of a word contained within the sentence\.<br><br>Considering this logic, there's no violation of the rules specified for the chatbot's input\.<br>OK|1|NN|
|The computer is slow and unresponsive|ok|To evaluate this input against the provided specification, we must determine if it contains both a sentence and a word, and if the word is contained within the given sentence\. The input "The computer is slow and unresponsive" is indeed a sentence as it expresses a complete thought\. However, upon closer inspection, it appears to lack a specific word that is supposed to be contained within this sentence, as typically defined by the input specification\. The specification mentions that the input should include both a sentence and a word, suggesting that these are distinct elements or perhaps implying that a word should be explicitly identified within or alongside the sentence\.<br><br>Given this interpretation, there seems to be a lack of clarity or direct compliance with the requirement for a "word" to be specified separately or highlighted from the sentence itself\. The input specification does not restrict the format except that it must contain both a sentence and a word, but it does not provide guidance on how these should be presented \(e\.g\., comma\-separated, quoted, etc\.\)\. <br><br>Since the input does contain a sentence and implicitly many words \("The", "computer", "is", "slow", "and", "unresponsive"\), one might argue for compliance if considering that any of these could serve as the required word\. However, this interpretation seems to stretch the implied structure suggested by having both a "sentence" and a "word" mentioned as distinct components\.<br><br>Considering the need for explicit mention or clear separation between a sentence and a contained word based on typical understandings of such requirements, it appears there might be an implication of non\-compliance due to ambiguity in interpretation rather than a clear violation\. Yet, given the constraints and focusing strictly on the specification without assuming additional structure \(like needing two distinct elements explicitly separated\), one could reason that any word within the sentence satisfies the "word" requirement, thus making the input valid under a more lenient reading\.<br><br>However, under strict adherence to the guidelines and acknowledging potential ambiguity in interpretation regarding the presentation of the sentence and word, my reasoning process leans towards recognizing an absence of clear non\-compliance based on direct interpretation but highlights the importance of clarity in such specifications for consistent evaluation\. <br><br>Therefore, focusing strictly on compliance without over\-interpreting, one could argue for compliance given that the sentence itself is a collection of words\.<br><br>OK|1|DT<br> NN<br> VBP<br> JJ<br> IN<br> JJ|
|The stars are invisible in the light of day|ok|To evaluate this input against the provided specification, I must determine if it contains both a sentence and a word, and if the word is contained within the sentence\. The input "The stars are invisible in the light of day" is a string that clearly forms a sentence due to its structure and grammatical completeness\. Additionally, this sentence inherently contains multiple words such as "stars," "invisible," "light," and "day\." Since any one of these words \(for example, "stars"\) is contained within the given sentence, the input does comply with the specification that it must contain both a sentence and a word where the word is part of the sentence\. There are no restrictions mentioned in the specification regarding punctuation or special characters that would affect this judgment, and none are present here to cause concern\.<br><br>OK|1|DT|
|The moon is new and unseen|ok|To determine if the given input complies with the specified requirements, we need to break down the input specification and compare it against the provided input\.<br><br>The input specification states that the input is a string containing a sentence and a word, where the word must be contained within the given sentence\. There are no restrictions on the format of the input except that it must contain both a sentence and a word\.<br><br>Given the input "The moon is new and unseen", we can identify "The moon is new and unseen" as the sentence\. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the input lacks an explicitly defined word that is separate from the sentence, which could potentially be seen as a requirement for compliance based on how one interprets "a string containing a sentence and a word"\.<br><br>Since the specification does not explicitly state how the sentence and the word should be presented \(e\.g\., separated by comma, semicolon, or any other delimiter\), but it does imply that both elements are necessary, we need to consider if the input inherently contains a word within its sentence structure\.<br><br>Each part of the sentence \("The", "moon", "is", "new", "and", "unseen"\) is indeed a word\. Therefore, we can argue that any one of these words is a word contained within the given sentence\. For instance, "moon" or "unseen" could be considered the word in question, as they are both part of the sentence\.<br><br>Given this interpretation, it seems there is no direct violation of the input specification since the sentence itself inherently contains multiple words, fulfilling the requirement for a sentence and a word to be present\.<br><br>Therefore, based on a strict reading of the provided specifications without making assumptions beyond what is directly stated, we can conclude that the input does comply with the requirements because it contains at least one word \("moon", "unseen", etc\.\) within its sentence structure\.<br><br>OK|1|The<br><br>DT<br><br>moon<br><br>NN<br><br>is<br><br>VBZ<br><br>new<br><br>JJ<br><br>and<br><br>IN<br><br>unseen<br><br>JJ|
|The students are confused and lost|ok|To evaluate this input against the provided specification, I first examine if it contains a sentence and a word\. The given text "The students are confused and lost" forms a coherent sentence that may contain various parts of speech such as nouns \("students"\), verbs \("are"\), adjectives \("confused", "lost"\), which complies with the part of the specification stating "The sentence can be of any length and may contain various parts of speech such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and more\." However, I must also consider if a specific word is identified within this context\. The input specification requires that "The word must be contained within the given sentence," but it does not specify how the word should be presented or identified\. In the given input, there's no clear indication of what word we are supposed to focus on; every word in the sentence \("The", "students", "are", "confused", "and", "lost"\) is contained within the sentence, which technically fulfills that part of the specification if we consider any one of these words as "the word" in question\. Yet, the spirit of the specification seems to imply an expectation of a specific word being highlighted or separately given for verification within the sentence, which is not explicitly done here\.<br><br>Given the explicit requirements outlined and focusing strictly on compliance without making assumptions beyond what's directly stated, I lean towards interpreting this input as lacking clear identification of "the word" intended for evaluation, despite all words being part of the sentence\. Thus, based on a strict reading of the specification where it might be implied that there should be an explicit or obvious way to identify "the word" from the given context, one could argue for non\-compliance due to the ambiguity in identifying a specific word within the input for evaluation against the criteria\.<br><br>However, if we consider any one of the words present as fulfilling the requirement since they are all contained within the sentence and no further instructions were given on how "the word" should be specified, then technically, every part of the specification could be seen as met without requiring additional context\. This interpretation hinges on whether one views the requirement for a word to be identified as necessitating an explicit or separate indication of that word\.<br><br>Therefore, depending on how strictly we interpret the need for an explicitly identifiable "word" within the given sentence and considering all elements of the specification, there's a rationale for both compliance and non\-compliance based on different readings of what the specification implies about identifying "the word"\.<br><br>But since the input does indeed contain a sentence and numerous words that are all contained within that sentence, without explicit instruction otherwise, it technically meets the given criteria when considering the letter of the law as stated in the specification\.<br><br>OK|1|JJ|
|The computer is crashed and unfixable|ok|The input specification requires that the input contains a sentence and a word, where the word must be contained within the given sentence\. In this case, "The computer is crashed and unfixable" appears to be a sentence but it does not explicitly contain another word that stands out as a separate entity mentioned in the input specification\. However, upon closer inspection, the entire phrase can be considered as both a sentence and containing words, with one of the words being part of the sentence itself\. The key issue here is determining if this meets the requirement of having "a sentence and a word\." Since the phrase does contain multiple words \("The", "computer", "is", etc\.\) which are all contained within the sentence, it could be argued that any one of these words satisfies the condition of being "a word" mentioned in the specification\. Therefore, considering "computer" or "crashed" as the word, for instance, this input seems to comply with the given input specification because it does indeed contain a sentence and at least one word \("The computer is crashed and unfixable" is the sentence and "crashed" can be seen as the contained word\)\.<br><br>OK|1|JJ|
|The music is classical and sophisticated|ok|To evaluate this input against the given specification, we must first identify if it contains both a sentence and a word as required\. The input "The music is classical and sophisticated" is indeed a sentence\. However, to fully comply with the specification, there should be a word that is contained within this given sentence\. Upon inspection, words like "music", "classical", and "sophisticated" are all part of the sentence\. Since the specification does not explicitly state how the sentence and word should be presented \(e\.g\., as separate elements or distinct parts of the input\), we can infer that any word within the sentence could be considered as the "word" mentioned in the specification, given no additional context is provided to suggest otherwise\.<br><br>Therefore, considering the input contains at least one sentence and includes words within it, which could implicitly satisfy the requirement for a contained word \(given the broad interpretation allowed by the absence of explicit formatting or separation requirements in the specification\), there seems to be no direct violation based on the information given and the rules as stated\. <br><br>OK|1|The output is a sequence of part\-of\-speech tags corresponding to each word in the input sentence:<br><br>DT NN VBZ JJ CC JJ|

According to the specification, the input must contain both a sentence and a word, where the word is part of the sentence\.<br><br>Upon re\-evaluation, considering the goal is to assess if the given string can serve as a valid input based on the provided criteria, it's crucial to recognize that the input "The stars are sparkling like fireworks" does contain multiple words \("The", "stars", "are", "sparkling", "like", "fireworks"\), and each of these words is contained within the sentence\. The specification does not mandate a specific word but requires a sentence with a word, which can be interpreted as any word that is part of the sentence\.<br><br>Given this interpretation, every component of the input adheres to the provided specifications: it includes a sentence \("The stars are sparkling like fireworks"\) and each word within this sentence qualifies as "a word" that is contained within the given sentence\.

|Fast car driving down the street|ok|To determine if the given input complies with the provided specification, we must analyze its components and compare them against the rules outlined in the specification\. The input specification requires that the input is a string containing both a sentence and a word, where the word must be contained within the given sentence\. There are no specific length or format restrictions other than the inclusion of both a sentence and a word\.<br><br>Looking at the input "Fast car driving down the street," it appears to be a sentence because it contains a subject \("car"\) and a verb \("driving"\), which are basic components of a sentence\. However, upon closer inspection, we notice that this input does not explicitly separate or identify a specific word as being distinct from the sentence\. Instead, every word in the string is part of the sentence itself\.<br><br>Given this observation, the key issue here is whether we can consider any one of the words within the sentence as "the word" required by the specification, even though no specific word is highlighted or separated from the rest of the sentence\. Since the input does contain multiple words and these words are undeniably part of a larger sentence structure, it could be argued that any one of these words \(like "car"\) serves as "a word" contained within "the sentence\."<br><br>However, to strictly comply with the specification without making assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated, we should consider whether the input provides both a distinct sentence and a distinct word\. In this case, while it's clear there is a sentence, the lack of an explicitly identified or separated word might pose a problem\.<br><br>But since the specification does not necessarily demand that the word and sentence be presented in a specific format \(like "sentence;word" or similar\), and given that every word within the sentence could technically qualify as "a word," we can infer that the input does indeed contain both a sentence and words\. Therefore, based on direct compliance with the provided specification without over\-interpreting its requirements, the input seems to fulfill the basic criteria of containing a sentence \(with multiple words\) where any one of those words is inherently part of the sentence\.<br><br>Considering these points, there's no clear violation of the rules specified for input structure\. Thus, based on the analysis that every component of the input aligns with at least a liberal interpretation of the specification allowing for implicit inclusion of both sentence and word without needing explicit differentiation, we can conclude that the input complies with the provided specification\.<br><br>OK|1|VBG|
