Here's a detailed prompt for your consideration:\n\n\"As a loving couple steps into a grand, ornate ballroom, surrounded by lavish furnishings and vibrant tapestries. Their elegant attire glimmers in shades of rose and gold, with hints of deep crimson beneath. Gossamer curtains of silver silk rustle softly as the music swells to sultry heights. Amidst this warm glow, candlelight dances across their faces, imbuing their features with a soft, romantic sheen. The background is a kaleidoscope of color: rich berry tones, sapphire blues, and fiery oranges, set against a backdrop of gold leaf and polished marble. This majestic setting whispers promises of countless nights to come, as the couple twirls into the future, lost in love's intoxicating haze.\"",
