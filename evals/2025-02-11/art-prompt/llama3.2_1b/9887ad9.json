  "output": "To generate this AI photo prompt, I'll need some details from you. Please provide the following:\n\n* The time of day (e.g., morning, noon, or sunset)\n* The weather conditions (e.g., clear, overcast, stormy)\n* Any notable features on the coastline (e.g., hidden caves, surfboards, sailboats)\n\nWith these details in mind, here's a prompt to guide your AI photo generation quest:\n\n\"A dramatic coastline landscape reveals rugged rocky shores, pounding crashing waves, and turbulent stormy skies with intense lighting that crackles the air. Against this backdrop of electric blues and burnished golds, ancient seaweed clings to weathered beaches. The air is charged with electricity as fierce gusts whisk sea spray into a whirling vortex, while a faint sailboat rides out its wake like a ghostly specter amidst the turmoil. This breathtaking scene summons a primal sense of power and turbulence.\"",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output contains two separate paragraphs instead of one singular paragraph as specified in the description. The first paragraph appears to be seeking additional information from the user, which does not align with the task of transforming user descriptions into detailed prompts for generating AI photos. However, the second paragraph seems to be a generated prompt that follows some parts of the chatbot's description such as detailing subjects and their characteristics, timing and lighting, background, and the feeling the image should evoke.\n\nERR"
