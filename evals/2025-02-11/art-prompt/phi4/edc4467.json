  "input": "A moody portrait of a solitary figure in a rainy city: dark tones, bold lines, and introspective atmosphere, set against a gritty urban background, evoking melancholy",
  "output": "Capture an enigmatic and thoughtful solitary figure standing beneath the heavy rain in a somber, dimly lit alley. Their attire is drenched and blending with the shadows, draped in dark hues that emphasize bold lines. Highlight strong features such as determined eyes or furrowed brows reflecting deep introspection. The setting is a gritty urban environment, with cobblestones glistening under yellow sodium lamps, puddles mirroring distorted neon signs above. The composition should be framed to let the cityâ€™s drab and worn textures dominate. The lighting is soft, diffuse from overhead streetlights, casting long shadows, creating an air of introspection. This backdrop intensifies the melancholic emotion, capturing a poignant moment where personal reflection mirrors the city's own solitude.",
