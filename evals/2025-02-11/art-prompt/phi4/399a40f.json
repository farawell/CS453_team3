  "output": "Arrange an assortment of vibrant fruits like ripe oranges, glossy red apples, and deep purple plums on an antique wooden table. Capture the scene with soft focus to create a dreamy effect while ensuring each fruit's texture comes through gently. Illuminate the composition with warm lighting that enhances their natural colors, casting subtle shadows for depth. The background should feature rustic elements such as worn wood panels or exposed brick, all in earthy tones to suggest warmth and familiarity. Together, these elements evoke a sense of comforting coziness, inviting contemplation or a quiet meal shared among friends.",
