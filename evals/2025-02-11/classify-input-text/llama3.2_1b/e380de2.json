  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is a news article title that can be classified under one of the categories provided in the description. Based on the content of the title, it appears to fall under the Business category as it mentions Apple, which is a well-known company, and discusses a business decision regarding their products. The description does not require the chatbot to explicitly state the category, but rather to classify the article based on its content. However, since the input is not given, we cannot check if the classification was correct or not. We can only check for explicit compliance with the description such as if it mentions one of the categories which this output does by implication. There are no other rules that can be checked without knowing the input. \n\nOK"
