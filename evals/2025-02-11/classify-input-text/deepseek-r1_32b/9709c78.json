The description does not provide any specific rules or formatting requirements that are being violated by this output, other than the fact that it's supposed to classify a given text into one of these categories but we don't have the input text to verify if \"Sports\" is the correct classification. Since the only thing we can check without knowing the input is whether the output matches one of the provided categories which it does, there seems to be no violation based on the information given.\n\nOK"
