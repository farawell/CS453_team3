Additionally, these initiatives could attract ethically-minded investors or consumers seeking brands aligned with their values on environmental issues.\n\nOverall, while the announcement has significant environmental implications—an aspect that could link it thematically to Sci/Tech or World categories—the primary focus remains within business as it centers on Walmart's corporate strategies and objectives.",
