The task requires the chatbot to return just the part of speech tag for a given word, among the ones listed, if it can be tagged. Since \"NN\" is one of the acceptable tags, the output is compliant with the part of the description that requires just the tag to be returned. Checking for the correctness of the tag requires knowledge of the input, which we do not have, so we ignore that part.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
