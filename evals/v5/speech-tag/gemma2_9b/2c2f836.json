The output consists solely of a part of speech tag, which aligns with the description's requirements to return just the tag. The description also specifies to return \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, or \"CantAnswer\" if unable to tag. Since these conditions do not apply to the output \"RB,\" there is no violation of the rules.\n\nNo violation. \nOK"
