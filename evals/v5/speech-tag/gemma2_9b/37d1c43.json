According to the chatbot description, the task is to return only the part of speech tag for the given word or \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, or \"CantAnswer\" if unable to tag the word. The output \"CD\" matches the format described in the specification as it's a valid part-of-speech tag from the listed ones. There's no indication here that the rules were violated based purely on the presence of this tag, without needing the context of the input.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
