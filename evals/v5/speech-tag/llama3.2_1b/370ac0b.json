  "evaluation": "The chatbot output provided lists parts of speech with accompanying tags, which is in line with the description requirement to return only the part-of-speech tag for a given word.\n\nHowever, the output also includes additional, non-required information, such as \"Determiner:\", \"Adjective:\", and an explanation about the Relativizer tag (\"RD\"), which is not part of the provided list of tags. The instructions specify that only the part of speech tag should be returned. This additional information makes the response non-compliant with the strict guideline to return just the appropriate tag.\n\nTo comply with the task's description, the chatbot's output should have been limited to only one of the listed part-of-speech tags or returned \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the output does not adhere to the specified requirement to limit the response to only the tag from the provided list.\n\nERR"
