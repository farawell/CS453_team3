The output includes a header (\"## Part of Speech Tags\") and extra formatting elements such as \"(word) - shocking\". Additionally, it provides multiple tags \"JJR or JJS or comparative\" suggesting a decision between tags rather than choosing one. The chatbot description specifies that it should return only a part of speech tag, and in case it is not possible, return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\". The output does not meet these requirements.\n\nERR"
