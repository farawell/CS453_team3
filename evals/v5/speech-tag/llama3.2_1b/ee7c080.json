  "input": "Test Case 3:\nSentence: \"They will finish the project by tomorrow.\"\nWord: \"will\"",
  "output": "### Test Case 3\n\n#### Part of Speech Tags\n\n1. **NNS**: Noun, plural\n2. **VBD**: Verb, base form (past tense)\n3. **VBZ**: Verb, 3rd person singular present (present tense)\n4. **Unknown**: (Word was not identifiable with the part of speech tags provided)\n\n#### Explanation and Rationale\n\nThe word \"will\" is a linking verb in this sentence. It connects the subject \"They\" to the predicate \"finish the project\". The part of speech tagging for words related to action or main function in sentences follow this pattern:\n\n- **NNS**: This is a plural noun, indicating that multiple people (in this case, the group working on the project) are involved.\n- **VBD**: This indicates an action performed in the past (as \"will\" serves as a linking verb to connect the auxiliary verb and the main verb in this case).\n- **VBZ**: This is a third person singular present tense of the verb \"finish\", indicating that \"They\" has finished or will finish the project.",

  "evaluation": "The output provided by the chatbot seems to suggest different parts of speech tags and explanations for words in a sentence. However, the description instructs that only a single tag should be returned for a given word's part of speech, along with returning \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged, or \"CantAnswer\" if unable to tag. \n\n1. The chatbot output does not simply provide a single part of speech tag for a word. Instead, it presents explanations and multiple tags which appear related to different words in a sentence. \n\n2. The given output includes an \"Explanation and Rationale\" section, which seems to describe a sentence-level analysis or rationale, rather than focusing on a single word's part of speech as specified.\n\n3. There are incorrect descriptions like \"Verb, base form (past tense)\" which contradicts VBD's definition as \"Verb, past tense\" in the instructions. Moreover, describing VBZ as \"present tense\" does not adhere to the defined tag for a \"3rd person singular present\".\n\nDue to these points, the output does not comply with the instructions to return only the part of speech tag for the specified word. Thus, it violates the guideline to provide only a response like \"NN\", \"VB\", \"Unknown\", or \"CantAnswer\" without additional explanations.\n\nERR"
