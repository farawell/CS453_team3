The output provided:\n\n1. Introduces a header ## Part-of-Speech Tagging, which is not required.\n2. Proceeds with an explanation about the sentence and the word, which is also not necessary.\n3. Provides a non-standard tag \"ADJ\" for adjective, instead of using the list available in the description, which specifies \"JJ\" for this part of speech.\n4. Outputs the final answer in the format of \"$adjective$\", which is not in the form of a standardized tag.\n\nThe description clearly states that only the part-of-speech tag should be returned, and it needs to be from a specific set of tags. The inclusion of additional information and formatting does not comply.\n\nERR"
