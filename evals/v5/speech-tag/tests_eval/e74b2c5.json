  "validity": "The input consists of a sentence paired with a specific word from that sentence. Based on the given input specification, I need to assess whether the sentence contains natural language text and if the provided word is a single word from that sentence.\n\n1. **Natural Language Text**: The sentence \"Where do you live?\" is a question that is clearly articulated in natural language. It follows the rules of syntax and semantics typical to English.\n   \n2. **Specific Word**: The word \"Where\" is a single word extracted from the given sentence. It appears at the beginning of the sentence, and therefore, is present within the sentence.\n\nSince the input satisfies both parts of the input specification by containing natural language text and selecting a specific word directly from the sentence, it complies with the input specification.\n\nOK"
