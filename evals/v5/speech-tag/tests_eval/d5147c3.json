  "coverage": "DET",
  "validity": "The input consists of a sentence and a specific word from that sentence. Let's evaluate the compliance of each part with the specification:\n\n1. **Sentence**: The sentence is \"I need a cup of coffee.\" which is a full sentence comprising natural language text. It forms a complete thought, is grammatically correct, and does not contain any non-natural language text. According to the specification, this satisfies the requirement that the input should include a sentence containing natural language text.\n\n2. **Word**: The word provided is \"a\". The task requires that this word be a single word from the provided sentence. In this case, \"a\" is clearly a word within the sentence \"I need a cup of coffee.\" This word is a part of the sentence and is correctly extracted from it.\n\nBoth parts of the input meet their respective criteria outlined in the input specification. There is a sentence, and the word is directly taken from this sentence as required. Therefore, there are no violations of the input specification.\n\nOK"
