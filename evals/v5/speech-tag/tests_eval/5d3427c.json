  "coverage": "Noun",
  "validity": "The input consists of two parts: a sentence and a word from that sentence. Let's evaluate each part of the input against the specification:\n\n1. **Sentence Compliance**: The sentence provided is \"She drew a line on the paper.\" This is a complete and coherent natural language sentence, fulfilling the requirement of containing natural language text.\n\n2. **Word Compliance**: The word provided is \"line\". We need to check if this word is a single word from the given sentence. Upon examining the sentence, \"line\" does indeed appear as a standalone word in the sentence \"She drew a line on the paper.\" thus fulfilling the requirement.\n\nSince the given input meets both components of the input specification—a valid sentence and a valid word chosen from that sentence—it complies with the input specification.\n\nOK"
