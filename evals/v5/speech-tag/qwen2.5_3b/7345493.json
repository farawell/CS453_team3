The description requires the chatbot to return just the part-of-speech tag, which it has done. Additionally, the description states that if the word cannot be tagged with the provided tags, the output should be \"Unknown\", and if unable to tag, the output should be \"CantAnswer\". However, since \"DT\" is a valid tag from the provided list, the output complies with the requirement to return a part-of-speech tag.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
