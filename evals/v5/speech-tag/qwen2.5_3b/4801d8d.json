  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output is expected to consist of a single part of speech tag from the given list of tags. The output \"VB\" is indeed a valid part of speech tag from the specified list (Verb, base form). However, the presence of \"VBĐS\" before \"VB\" is not part of the list of valid tags and seems like an additional, possibly erroneous, string. This violates the requirement to return only one specified tag or one of the specified fallback responses (\"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\"). \n\nTherefore, this discrepancy, due to the inclusion of an unexpected token before the correct tag, leads to non-compliance with the description. \n\nERR"
