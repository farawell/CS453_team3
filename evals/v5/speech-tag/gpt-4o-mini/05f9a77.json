The task requires the chatbot to return only the part of speech tag, and it has done so correctly. Since I cannot determine if the word can be tagged with \"VB\" without knowing the input, I focus solely on the requirement that the chatbot returns only the tag, which it has met.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
