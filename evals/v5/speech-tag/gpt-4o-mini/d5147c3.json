The description specifies a list of tags that the chatbot should use, and \"DT\" (Determiner) is included in that list. Since the output matches one of the acceptable tags and does not include anything else, it complies directly with the requirement to return just the tag. The evaluation focuses solely on whether the output violates the format and content rules, which it does not in this case.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
