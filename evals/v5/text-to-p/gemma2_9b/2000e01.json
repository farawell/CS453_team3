This meets the requirement specified in the description to have at least three `<p>` tags, each containing one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags. Since the description also states that the output should include three sentences formatted this way, and this condition is met without any additional conditions violating any rules, the output complies with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
