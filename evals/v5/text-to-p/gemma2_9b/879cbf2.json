Each sentence now has its own `<p>` tag, creating paragraphs in the HTML output.\n2.  **Emphasis with Tags:** Within each `<p>` tag, I've added a `<strong>` tag to bold key words or phrases that convey importance. I've also used multiple `<em>` tags within each sentence to emphasize other important terms and phrases.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like further adjustments to the HTML formatting!",
