Within each `<p>` tag, there is one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which emphasize key words and phrases. This structure aligns with the requirement to split a paragraph into individual sentences and wrap each sentence in a `<p>` tag with added `<strong>` and `<em>` tags. The output meets the conditions specified in the description, as it includes at least three `<p>` tags with appropriate use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
