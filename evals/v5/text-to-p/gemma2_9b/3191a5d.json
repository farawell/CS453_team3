Inside each `<p>` tag, there is one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags used to emphasize key words and phrases. This aligns with the description's requirements to have at least three `<p>` tags and to include both `<strong>` and `<em>` tags within each. Since all specified criteria in the description (which don't require knowing the input) have been met, the output is compliant.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
