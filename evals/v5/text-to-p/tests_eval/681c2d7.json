  "validity": "The input consists of three complete sentences, which satisfies the requirement of having at least three sentences. However, the input specification also requires the presence of key words or phrases that are suitable for emphasis. In the given input, there's no apparent emphasis placed on any particular words or phrases. The sentences are simple statements without any elements that naturally draw emphasis or highlight significance. Thus, the input fails to meet this part of the specification.\n\nERR"
