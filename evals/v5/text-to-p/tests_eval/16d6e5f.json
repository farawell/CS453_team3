  "input": "A healthy diet is essential. Water is vital. Sleep is restorative.",
  "coverage": "```html\n<p>A <strong>healthy</strong> diet is <em>essential</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Water</strong> is <em>vital</em>.</p>\n<p>Sleep is <em>restorative</em> and <strong>important</strong>.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "The input consists of three sentences: \"A healthy diet is essential.\", \"Water is vital.\", and \"Sleep is restorative.\" Each of these sentences is complete, satisfying the requirement for at least three complete sentences.\n\nHowever, the specification also asks for the input to contain key words or phrases suitable for emphasis. The sentences are simple and straightforward declarative sentences. While words like \"essential,\" \"vital,\" and \"restorative\" could be considered as somewhat emphatic, the overall lack of context or additional emphasis means that it does not strongly meet the criteria of containing key words or phrases suitable for emphasis.\n\nThus, while the paragraph satisfies the requirement of having three complete sentences, it does not clearly adhere to the requirement for emphasis in the form of key words or phrases. Since the emphasis component is not adequately addressed, the input does not fully comply with the input specification.\n\nERR"
