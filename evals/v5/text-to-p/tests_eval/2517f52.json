  "validity": "The input consists of three sentences: \"Friends support,\" \"Family comforts,\" and \"Community unites.\" Each of these can be considered a standalone sentence given they include a subject and a verb. However, the key aspect of the input specification is the inclusion of key words or phrases suitable for emphasis. The provided sentences are very brief and do not contain any explicit emphasis that is evident. Typically, emphasis would be marked by adjectives, adverbs, or phrases that highlight significance or importance, and this isn't clearly present in the sentences provided.\n\nERR"
