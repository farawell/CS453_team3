  "coverage": "```html\n<p><strong>Breakfast</strong> is <em>important</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Lunch</strong> provides <em>energy</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Dinner</strong> is a <em>time</em> to <em>relax</em>.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "The input consists of three sentences: \"Breakfast is important.\", \"Lunch provides energy.\", and \"Dinner is a time to relax.\" Each of these sentences is grammatically complete, fulfilling the requirement for at least three complete sentences.\n\nHowever, the input fails to comply with the requirement for key words or phrases suitable for emphasis. None of the sentences contain any words or phrases that seem designed for emphasis, such as words in all caps, italics, bold, or other forms of textual emphasis. Additionally, there arenâ€™t any particularly standout words or statements in the content of the sentences that naturally seem to require emphasis.\n\nGiven these observations, the input has an emphasis-related violation.\n\nERR"
