  "validity": "The input consists of three sentences: \"Books open knowledge.\", \"Pens ink ideas.\", and \"Computers process data.\". Each sentence is complete with a subject and a verb. However, the sentences do not contain key words or phrases that are suitable for emphasis. The sentences are simple and declarative, but they lack any emphasis-inducing elements like adjectives, adverbs, or phrases that draw attention or warrant emphasis.\n\nTherefore, while the input meets the requirement of having at least three complete sentences, it fails to meet the requirement of containing key words or phrases suitable for emphasis.\n\nERR"
