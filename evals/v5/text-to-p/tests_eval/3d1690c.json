  "validity": "The input is a paragraph of text and consists of three sentences: \"Nature rejuvenates.\", \"Machines automate.\", and \"Society evolves.\" While the input meets the requirement of being at least three sentences long, these sentences are very short. Additionally, the specification requires that the input contain key words or phrases suitable for emphasis. The sentences are constructed using very general terms and lack emphasis keywords or phrases that stand out or would typically be highlighted for importance or deeper meaning. The absence of such keywords or phrases leads to non-compliance with the specification.\n\nERR"
