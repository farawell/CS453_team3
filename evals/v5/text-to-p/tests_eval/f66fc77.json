  "input": "Honesty is valuable. Kindness is appreciated. Patience is rewarding.",
  "coverage": "```html\n<p><strong>Honesty</strong> is <em>valuable</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Kindness</strong> is <em>appreciated</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Patience</strong> is <em>rewarding</em>.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "The input consists of three distinct sentences: \"Honesty is valuable,\" \"Kindness is appreciated,\" and \"Patience is rewarding.\" Each of these is a complete sentence, satisfying the requirement for at least three complete sentences. However, the input specification also requires that the input should contain key words or phrases suitable for emphasis. While the sentences present positive qualities, they do not inherently emphasize any particular word or phrase; there is no use of words like \"very,\" \"extremely,\" or any other syntactic or stylistic element that inherently suggests emphasis according to standard norms of emphasis in text. Thus, the input fails the criteria for containing key words or phrases suitable for emphasis.\n\nERR"
