  "input": "Fire burns. Water flows. Air moves.",
  "coverage": "```html\n<p><strong>Fire</strong> <em>burns</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Water</strong> <em>flows</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Air</strong> <em>moves</em>.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "The input consists of three sentences: \"Fire burns.\", \"Water flows.\", and \"Air moves.\". This satisfies the requirement of having at least three complete sentences. However, the input does not contain any key words or phrases that are suitable for emphasis according to the specification. Each sentence is a simple statement with no elements that clearly stand out as being emphasized. Based on the input specification, one might expect some form of emphasis through phrasing or the inclusion of obviously emphatic words, such as those indicating strong emotions, significant events, or noteworthy characteristics, which are absent here.\n\nERR"
