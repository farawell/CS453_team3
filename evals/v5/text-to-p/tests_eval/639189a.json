  "rule": "Each sentence of the paragraph must be enclosed in its own <p> tag.",
  "input": "Cats purr when happy. Dogs wag tails. Birds sing in the morning.",
  "coverage": "```html\n<p>Cats <strong>purr</strong> when <em>happy</em>.</p>\n<p>Dogs <strong>wag</strong> their <em>tails</em>.</p>\n<p>Birds <strong>sing</strong> in the <em>morning</em>.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "The input consists of three sentences: \"Cats purr when happy.\", \"Dogs wag tails.\", and \"Birds sing in the morning.\". This satisfies the requirement of the input consisting of at least three complete sentences. However, the specification also requires the input to contain key words or phrases suitable for emphasis. In this paragraph, there are no words or phrases that are emphasized or particularly suitable for emphasis, as all sentences are very straightforward and lack elements like emotional language or striking information that would naturally lend themselves to emphasis. \n\nDue to the absence of keywords or phrases suitable for emphasis, the input violates the input specification.\n\nERR"
