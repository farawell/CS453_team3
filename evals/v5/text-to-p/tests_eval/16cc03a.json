  "coverage": "```html\n<p>Nature is <strong>beautiful</strong>. The <em>trees</em>, <em>mountains</em>, and <em>oceans</em> all contribute to its <em>wonder</em>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>universe</strong> is vast. There are <em>billions</em> of <em>galaxies</em>, each containing numerous <em>stars</em> and <em>planets</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Exploration</strong> is exciting. <em>Discovering</em> new places and <em>learning</em> about different <em>cultures</em> is an <em>adventure</em>.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "The input provided consists of three sentences:\n1. \"Nature is beautiful.\"\n2. \"The universe is vast.\"\n3. \"Exploration is exciting.\"\n\nThe input meets the requirement of having at least three complete sentences. However, it lacks key words or phrases suitable for emphasis. Words like \"beautiful,\" \"vast,\" or \"exciting\" could be considered for emphasis, but the input specification requests explicit emphasis within the context, rather than relying on reader interpretation. \n\nTherefore, a violation exists due to the absence of explicitly emphasized key words or phrases in the text. \n\nERR"
