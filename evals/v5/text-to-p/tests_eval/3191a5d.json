  "coverage": "```html\n<p>Gaming is <strong>immersive</strong>. It allows individuals to <em>experience</em> new worlds and <em>engage</em> fully in interactive stories.</p>\n<p>Programming is <strong>challenging</strong>. It requires <em>critical thinking</em> and the ability to solve <em>complex problems</em> efficiently.</p>\n<p>Writing is <strong>introspective</strong>. It encourages <em>self-reflection</em> and allows one to <em>explore</em> their thoughts deeply.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "The input consists of three sentences: \"Gaming is immersive.\", \"Programming is challenging.\", and \"Writing is introspective.\" These sentences are clear and concise, meeting the requirement of the input being at least three complete sentences. However, the input specification also requires that the input should contain key words or phrases suitable for emphasis. The input sentences present descriptors such as \"immersive\", \"challenging\", and \"introspective\", which can be perceived as suitable for emphasis due to their descriptive nature, especially when considering context. Thus, the input meets both criteria in the specification.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
