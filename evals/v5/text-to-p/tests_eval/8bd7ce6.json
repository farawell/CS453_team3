  "input": "Oceans are vast. Mountains are tall. Forests are dense.",
  "coverage": "```html\n<p>Oceans are <strong>vast</strong>. <em>Oceans</em> create a significant part of our <em>planet</em>'s surface, offering immeasurable <em>diversity</em> in aquatic life.</p>\n<p>Mountains are <strong>tall</strong>. Towering majestically, they <em>inspire</em> awe and challenge <em>adventurers</em> with their <em>rugged</em> beauty.</p>\n<p>Forests are <strong>dense</strong>. These <em>lush</em> ecosystems are teeming with <em>wildlife</em> and provide critical <em>oxygen</em> to our atmosphere.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "The input consists of three sentences: \"Oceans are vast.\", \"Mountains are tall.\", and \"Forests are dense.\". This satisfies the requirement that the input must consist of at least three complete sentences. However, the sentences do not contain any key words or phrases suitable for emphasis. Typically, emphasis involves highlighting words that carry significant information or importance, such as highlights on contrasting ideas or intensifying adjectives. Phrases like \"incredibly vast\", \"stunningly tall\", or \"remarkably dense\" could suffice as emphasis.\n\nConsidering the requirement for emphasis and the lack of such emphasis in the input, this results in non-compliance with the input specification.\n\nERR"
