  "input": "Technology evolves rapidly. Communication connects people. Art reveals creativity.",
  "coverage": "```html\n<p><strong>Technology</strong> evolves <em>rapidly</em>. It <em>continuously</em> transforms our world.</p>\n<p><strong>Communication</strong> connects <em>people</em>. It <em>bridges</em> distances and <em>cultures</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Art</strong> reveals <em>creativity</em>. It <em>inspires</em> and enriches our lives.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "The input consists of three short sentences: \"Technology evolves rapidly.\", \"Communication connects people.\", and \"Art reveals creativity.\" Each sentence is complete with a subject, verb, and object/complement, meeting the requirement of having at least three complete sentences.\n\nHowever, the input specification also requires that the input should contain key words or phrases suitable for emphasis. While each sentence contains nouns and verbs which could be emphasized in context (such as emphasizing \"Technology\", \"Communication\", or \"Art\"), the sentences are so broadly stated and universally acknowledged that they lack any distinctive key words or phrases specifically crafted for emphasis or highlighted importance within the paragraph itself. Therefore, this requirement may not be fully satisfied, as the sentences do not naturally emphasize specific aspects or ideas which stand out from general statements without additional context.\n\nTherefore, while the number of sentences requirement is met, the absence of clearly emphasized key words or phrases is a violation of the input specification.\n\nERR"
