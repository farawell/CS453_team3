  "rule": "The output must appropriately balance the usage of <strong> and <em> tags without excessive emphasis that disrupts readability.",
  "input": "Travel broadens the mind. Education empowers individuals. Debate stimulates thought.",
  "coverage": "```html\n<p>Travel <strong>broadens</strong> the <em>mind</em>.</p>\n<p>Education <strong>empowers</strong> <em>individuals</em>.</p>\n<p>Debate <strong>stimulates</strong> <em>thought</em>.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "The given input consists of three sentences: \"Travel broadens the mind.\", \"Education empowers individuals.\", and \"Debate stimulates thought.\". Each sentence is complete, with a subject and a verb expressing a complete thought, thus meeting the requirement for at least three complete sentences. However, the input specification requires that the input should contain key words or phrases suitable for emphasis. While the sentences are statements that potentially could contain emphasis, the input as presented does not explicitly mark or highlight any keywords or phrases that are emphasized. Therefore, there is non-compliance in terms of lacking explicitly emphasized words or phrases, as required by the specification.\n\nERR"
