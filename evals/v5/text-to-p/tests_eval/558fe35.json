  "rule": "Each sentence of the paragraph must be enclosed in its own <p> tag.",
  "input": "Planets orbit the sun. The moon is Earth's satellite. Stars shine brightly at night.",
  "coverage": "```html\n<p><strong>Planets</strong> orbit the <em>sun</em>.</p>\n<p>The <em>moon</em> is <strong>Earth's</strong> <em>satellite</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Stars</strong> shine <em>brightly</em> at <em>night</em>.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "To determine if the input complies with the input specification, I will evaluate it based on the given criteria:\n\n1. **Minimum of Three Complete Sentences**:\n   - The input contains three sentences: \n     1. \"Planets orbit the sun.\"\n     2. \"The moon is Earth's satellite.\"\n     3. \"Stars shine brightly at night.\"\n   - Thus, the input meets the requirement of having at least three complete sentences.\n\n2. **Keywords or Phrases Suitable for Emphasis**:\n   - The input specification requires that there should be keywords or phrases suitable for emphasis. The sentences provided are factual statements, but there is no clear emphasis on any particular keyword or phrase. Words like \"orbit,\" \"satellite,\" and \"shine brightly\" could potentially be emphasized, yet they are presented in a neutral tone without explicit emphasis.\n\nBased on the evaluation, while the input does meet the requirement for complete sentences, it lacks clearly defined or explicit keywords or phrases suitable for emphasis. Therefore, the input specification regarding emphasis is not fully satisfied.\n\nThinking: The input satisfies the sentence requirement but falls short in meeting the emphasis criterion.\n\nERR"
