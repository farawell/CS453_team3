  "rule": "The output must represent a paragraph of text formatted as HTML with individual sentences wrapped in <p> tags.",
  "input": "HTML is a markup language. CSS styles web pages. JavaScript adds interactivity.",
  "coverage": "```html\n<p>HTML is a <strong>markup language</strong>. It helps in structuring <em>web content</em> efficiently.</p>\n<p>CSS <strong>styles</strong> web pages to make them <em>visually appealing</em> and <em>responsive</em>.</p>\n<p>JavaScript adds <strong>interactivity</strong>, enhancing the <em>user experience</em> with dynamic <em>features</em>.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "The input consists of three sentences: \"HTML is a markup language.\", \"CSS styles web pages.\", and \"JavaScript adds interactivity.\" These are three complete sentences, satisfying the requirement for the input to consist of at least three complete sentences. However, the specification also requires the input to contain key words or phrases suitable for emphasis. While the terms \"HTML,\" \"CSS,\" and \"JavaScript\" are key terms in the context of web development and potentially suitable for emphasis, the specification does not explicitly state how these should appear in the text to be emphasized. Despite this ambiguity, since the terms are significant and can be emphasized in the context of web technologies, they meet the requirements for emphasis.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
