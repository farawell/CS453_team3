  "coverage": "```html\n<p><strong>Learning</strong> is <em>continual</em>. It is a <em>process</em> that <em>never</em> ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Growth</strong> is <em>crucial</em> for both <em>personal</em> and <em>professional</em> development.</p>\n<p><strong>Innovation</strong> improves <em>lives</em>, driving <em>progress</em> and leading to <em>better</em> solutions.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "The input consists of three sentences: \"Learning is continual.\", \"Growth is crucial.\", and \"Innovation improves lives.\" This complies with the input specification requiring at least three complete sentences. Each sentence conveys a standalone idea, ending with appropriate punctuation. However, the input specification also requires key words or phrases suitable for emphasis. The sentences contain key concepts such as \"Learning\", \"Growth\", and \"Innovation\", which could be considered significant or emphatic within the context of personal or professional development.\n\nThus, while the sentences are simple, the inclusion of the terms \"Learning\", \"Growth\", and \"Innovation\" aligns with the requirement for key words or phrases suitable for emphasis.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
