  "validity": "The input consists of three sentences: \"Running boosts health.\", \"Cycling builds strength.\", and \"Swimming enhances stamina.\". This satisfies the requirement of having at least three complete sentences. However, the specification also states that the input should contain key words or phrases suitable for emphasis. The sentences here present factual statements related to exercise and health benefits, but they do not contain any words or phrases that are emphasized or appear to be particularly suitable for emphasis beyond their factual nature.\n\nERR"
