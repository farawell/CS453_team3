  "evaluation": "The chatbot output correctly splits the paragraph into individual sentences and wraps each sentence with a `<p>` tag. Additionally, it uses the `<strong>` tag to emphasize a word in each sentence and employs `<em>` tags to highlight other key words. The output includes more than three `<p>` tags, which exceeds the required minimum. Since the compliance requires at least three `<p>` tags and appropriate usage of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, this output meets all the specified conditions in the chatbot description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
