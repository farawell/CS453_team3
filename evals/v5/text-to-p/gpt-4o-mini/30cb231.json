Each paragraph contains a sentence wrapped in a `<p>` tag.\n\n2. **Use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags**: Each paragraph is expected to include at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags. The output adheres to this requirement as each `<p>` tag includes a `<strong>` tag and precisely two `<em>` tags.\n\nThe output thoroughly adheres to the requirements laid out in the description. It contains more than three `<p>` tags, with each `<p>` tag including one `<strong>` tag and two `<em>` tags. Therefore, the output complies with the chatbot's description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
