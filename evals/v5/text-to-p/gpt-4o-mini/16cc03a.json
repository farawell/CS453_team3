The output indeed contains six `<p>` tags, which is equal to the at least three requirement.\n\n3. Within each `<p>` tag, there's a `<strong>` tag used to emphasize a single word in each sentence and `<em>` tags used to emphasize other words, complying with the description.\n\nIn conclusion, the output complies with all specific guidelines of the description as described without requiring input knowledge for validation. Therefore, there are no violations to address.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
