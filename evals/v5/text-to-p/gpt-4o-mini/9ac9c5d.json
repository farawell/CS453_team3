Each `<p>` tag contains both a `<strong>` tag and an `<em>` tag, which adheres to the requirement of adding one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases within each sentence. Even though the content in `<p>` tags seem repetitive, since the input isn't provided, it's not possible to verify if this is an error. Based on the description, the output follows the formatting rules, and there are no violations to note.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
