  "evaluation": "The output does not comply with the description in several ways:\n\n1. **Structure and Nesting of Tags**: Each `<p>` tag is expected to contain a complete sentence, and within that sentence, there should be `<strong>` and `<em>` tags emphasizing key words. In the provided output, the placement of `<strong>` tags and incomplete nesting of tags create structural issues. For example, `<p><strong>_language</strong></p><strong>This</strong> ...` shows that there are `<strong>` tags outside the `<p>` tags which is inconsistent.\n\n2. **Tag Closure**: The output contains improperly closed tags. For instance, `</p>` appears before the sentence has concluded, indicating that the tags are not properly nested within complete sentences.\n\n3. **Detached <p> Tags**: There are instances where `<p>` tags are not wrapped around complete sentences, such as `<p><strong>_language</strong></p>` where the remainder of the sentence is outside the `<p>` tag.\n\n4. **Excessive <strong> Tags**: The description suggests adding one `<strong>` tag per sentence, but the output contains multiple `<strong>` tags per sentence without any particular rationale given the formatting description provided.\n\nDue to these violations regarding the structure, nesting, and usage of HTML tags according to the formatting rules provided in the description, the output does not comply with the given task.\n\nERR"
