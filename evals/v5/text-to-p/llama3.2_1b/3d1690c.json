However, the usage of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags is inconsistent with the requirement to include both within each `<p>` tag. Specifically:\n\n1. The first `<p>` tag does not include any `<strong>` or `<em>` tags, but instead contains double asterisks (**) which are not valid HTML tags for text formatting.\n\n2. The second `<p>` tag includes a `<strong>` tag, which is correct, but does not include any `<em>` tags.\n\n3. The third `<p>` tag includes an `<em>` tag but no `<strong>` tag.\n\n4. The fourth `<p>` tag includes a `<strong>` tag but no `<em>` tag.\n\n5. The fifth `<p>` tag includes an `<em>` tag but uses double asterisks (**) at the end, which are not valid HTML tags.\n\nEach `<p>` tag should contain both one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which is not fulfilled in this output. Therefore, the output does not comply with the described requirements.\n\nERR"
