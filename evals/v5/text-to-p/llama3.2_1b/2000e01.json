Split the paragraph into individual sentences and wrap each sentence with a `<p>` tag.\n2. Ensure the formatted text contains at least three `<p>` tags.\n3. Within each `<p>` tag, add one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize keywords and phrases.\n\nUpon reviewing the output, the following observations were made:\n\n- The output contains multiple `<p>` tags; this satisfies the requirement of having at least three `<p>` elements.\n  \n- However, the description specifies that each `<p>` tag should contain one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. In the provided output, some `<p>` tags contain only `<strong>` tags or only `<em>` tags, not both.\n  \n- Specifically, the `<p>` tags for “Snow: Fall in winter” only contain `<em>` tags and no `<strong>` tags, while other paragraphs contain only `<strong>` tags without any `<em>` tags.\n\nGiven these considerations, there is a violation of the requirement that each `<p>` tag should have both a `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
