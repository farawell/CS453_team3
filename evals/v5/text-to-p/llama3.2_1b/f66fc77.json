  "evaluation": "The chatbot output does not comply with the described task for several reasons. First, the description mandates that each sentence should be wrapped in a `<p>` tag. In this output, the use of `<p>` tags is not correctly structured around complete sentences, and in some places, tags seem to be left open or incorrectly closed. For example, there are instances of improperly closed and nested tags within sentences, which breaks the sentence structure required by the task.\n\nSecond, the output does not contain at least three distinct `<p>` tags with complete sentences, as required. The output does not follow the guideline where each sentence should only have one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases, as it has multiple strong tags scattered without clear sentence demarcation.\n\nTherefore, these structural issues with `<p>` tags and the placement of `<strong>` tags indicate a non-compliance with the task description.\n\nERR"
