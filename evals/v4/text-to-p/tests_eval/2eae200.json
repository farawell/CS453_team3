The specification requires the input paragraph to be substantial enough to allow for at least three `<p>` tags after splitting, usually suggesting the need for more content or a longer passage. \n\nGiven the lack of sufficient content to form coherent distinct paragraphs, this input fails to meet the minimum content length requirement.\n\nERR"
