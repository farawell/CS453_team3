  "rule": "The content within the <strong> and <em> tags must be relevant key words and phrases from the input text.",
  "input": "Exercise promotes health. Walking daily is beneficial. Consistency is key.",
  "coverage": "```html\n<p><strong>Exercise</strong> <em>promotes</em> <em>health</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Walking</em> <strong>daily</strong> is <em>beneficial</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Consistency</strong> is <em>key</em>.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "The given input consists of three sentences: \"Exercise promotes health.\", \"Walking daily is beneficial.\" and \"Consistency is key.\" Upon analysis, the input does not comply with the specification due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Single Paragraph Requirement**: The input is indeed a single paragraph of text, so it meets this part of the specification.\n\n2. **Minimum Number of `<p>` Tags**: The input consists of only three sentences. The specification requires that input should contain enough sentences to allow for at least three `<p>` tags after splitting. In practical application, this means having enough content for at least three distinct and substantial segments suitable for paragraph separation. The provided input, with only three sentences, does not meet this requirement, as it would not produce adequately detailed and distinctive paragraphs suitable for three `<p>` tags.\n\n3. **Textual Content**: The input is textual and does not include non-text elements, meeting this requirement.\n\nOverall, the main issue lies with the insufficient number of sentences to create content suitable for three paragraphs when split. \n\nERR"
