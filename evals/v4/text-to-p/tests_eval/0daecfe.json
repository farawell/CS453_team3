  "coverage": "```html\n<p>Sports can <strong>unite</strong> communities. <em>Sports</em> have the power to bring people together and <em>create</em> a sense of belonging.</p>\n<p><strong>Teamwork</strong> encourages unity. When individuals work together as a <em>team</em>, they can achieve <em>goals</em> that are beyond their individual capacities.</p>\n<p>Commitment <strong>builds</strong> character. <em>Sticking</em> to goals and continuously <em>striving</em> to improve helps develop a person's inner strength and <em>integrity</em>.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "The input provided is a single paragraph of text that consists of three sentences: \"Sports can unite communities. Teamwork encourages unity. Commitment builds character.\" According to the input specification, the paragraph should contain enough sentences to allow for at least three `<p>` tags after splitting. Each `<p>` tag typically encapsulates a paragraph, and the minimum length of a paragraph is often more than just a single sentence, especially if no elaboration or additional context is provided. \n\nGiven the brevity of each sentence and the lack of further context or content that would typically be involved in a paragraph, it is unlikely that they can be considered sufficient for splitting into three separate paragraphs using `<p>` tags without additional information or expansion. Furthermore, while the sentences may include words suitable for emphasis, such as \"unite,\" \"teamwork,\" and \"commitment,\" the compliance question pertains more critically to paragraph length rather than the opportunity for textual attributes like emphasis.\n\nTherefore, the input does not meet the requirement of containing enough content for three substantial paragraphs.\n\nERR"
