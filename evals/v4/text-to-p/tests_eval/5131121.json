The paragraph must contain enough sentences to allow for at least three `<p>` tags after splitting: The input contains three sentences, which indeed allows for at least three `<p>` tags if each sentence were to form its own paragraph.\n\n3. The input can include key words and phrases suitable for emphasis with `<strong>` and `<em>` tags: The input does include words like \"HTML,\" \"web developers,\" and \"internet\" which could be emphasized, though this is not strictly required by the specification.\n\n4. The input is expected to be textual and should not include non-text elements like images or videos: The input contains only plain text and no non-text elements, meeting this requirement.\n\nGiven that the input meets all specified requirements, there are no violations of the input specification.\n\nOK"
