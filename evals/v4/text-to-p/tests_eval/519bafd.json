However, the input only contains three sentences, which means it would not allow for at least three `<p>` tags after splitting. Since the input specification requires enough sentences to allow for at least three `<p>` tags, this input does not comply with that requirement. The input does not include non-text elements and could include keywords or phrases for emphasis, but the main issue is the insufficient number of sentences.\n\nERR"
