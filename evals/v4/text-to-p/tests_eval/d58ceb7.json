  "rule": "The content within the <strong> and <em> tags must be relevant key words and phrases from the input text.",
  "input": "Educational systems vary globally. They prepare future leaders. Equality in education remains a goal.",
  "coverage": "```html\n<p>Educational systems <em>vary</em> globally. They <strong>prepare</strong> future leaders.</p>\n<p><em>Equality</em> in <strong>education</strong> remains a goal.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "The provided input is a single paragraph containing three sentences: \"Educational systems vary globally.\", \"They prepare future leaders.\", and \"Equality in education remains a goal.\". According to the input specification, the paragraph must contain enough sentences to allow for at least three `<p>` tags after splitting. However, the input only has three sentences, which would correspond to three `<p>` tags if each sentence is placed in a separate `<p>` tag. Hence, the input does not comply as it does not clearly allow for at least three `<p>` tags aside from addressing its qualification for key emphasis using tags like `<em>` or `<strong>`. Therefore, based on the requirements, the input does not comply as no explicit keywords or emphasis phrases have been checked for in this short evaluation due to shorter content issue leading to the conclusion.\n\nERR"
