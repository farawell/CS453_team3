  "coverage": "```html\n<p>The <strong>sun</strong> <em>shines</em> <em>brightly</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Birds</strong> <em>sing</em>.</p>\n<p>The day <em>starts</em> <strong>anew</strong>.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "The input needs to be evaluated against the specification provided:\n\n1. **Single Paragraph**: The input is a single paragraph, as it is not divided into multiple distinct paragraphs.\n2. **Enough Sentences for `<p>` Tags**: The specification requires the input to contain enough sentences to allow for at least three `<p>` tags after splitting. The input provides three short sentences. Typically, a single sentence does not qualify as a full paragraph; thus, having only three sentences does not meet the requirement for creating multiple (at least three) valid `<p>` tags.\n3. **Textual Content**: The input consists entirely of textual content, with no non-text elements like images or videos.\n4. **Key Words for Emphasis**: The input includes words and phrases such as \"sun shines brightly,\" \"birds sing,\" and \"day starts anew.\" These can be emphasized.\n\nBased on my analysis, the violation concerns the requirement for enough sentences to enable forming at least three `<p>` tags. Three brief sentences do not inherently suffice to create multiple complete paragraphs often necessary for three distinct `<p>` tags, typically containing more detail or length.\n\nERR"
