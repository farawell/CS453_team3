  "rule": "The output must contain multiple sentences from the input text, each enclosed in separate <p> tags.",
  "input": "Artificial Intelligence is transforming industries. AI continues to advance. Innovations emerge rapidly.",
  "coverage": "```html\n<p><em>Artificial Intelligence</em> is <strong>transforming</strong> industries.</p>\n<p><strong>AI</strong> continues to <em>advance</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Innovations</em> emerge <strong>rapidly</strong>.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "The input consists of a single paragraph of text, which is compliant with the first condition of the specification. However, upon splitting this paragraph into sentences, we only identify three sentences (\"Artificial Intelligence is transforming industries.\", \"AI continues to advance.\", and \"Innovations emerge rapidly.\"). This result provides only three segments, which does not satisfy the requirement of the input paragraph having enough content to allow for at least three `<p>` tags. Generally, to have three `<p>` tags, one would expect at least a triad of groupings, ideally requiring more substantial content.\n\nFurthermore, the input is purely textual and does not contain non-text elements like images or videos, adhering to that aspect of the specification.\n\nIn conclusion, due to the lack of sufficient content to form at least three `<p>` tags, the input does not comply with the input specification.\n\nERR"
