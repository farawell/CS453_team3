  "coverage": "```html\n<p><strong>Cloud computing services</strong> are <em>flexible</em>.</p>\n<p>They <strong>reduce costs</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Security</strong> in <em>cloud technology</em> is <em>advancing</em>.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "The input consists of one paragraph of text, which is compliant with the single-paragraph requirement of the input specification. However, the paragraph contains only three sentences: \"Cloud computing services are flexible.\" \"They reduce costs.\" \"Security in cloud technology is advancing.\" When split into potential `<p>` tags, this would result in only three `<p>` tags. The input specification requires the paragraph to contain enough sentences to allow for at least three `<p>` tags, implying more than three sentences. Therefore, the input does not meet the requirement of having more sentences. There is no misuse of non-textual elements, as the input is entirely textual. The compliance issue stems solely from the insufficient number of sentences.\n\nERR"
