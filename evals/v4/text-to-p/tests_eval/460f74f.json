  "coverage": "```html\n<p><strong>Digital communication</strong> is <em>fast</em> and <em>effective</em>.</p>\n<p>It <strong>breaks</strong> <em>barriers</em>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>internet</strong> facilitates these <em>interactions</em>.</p>\n```",
  "validity": "The input provided is a single paragraph of text. For compliance with the specification, it needs to contain enough sentences to allow for at least three `<p>` tags after splitting. Here, the input consists of only three sentences: \"Digital communication is fast and effective.\", \"It breaks barriers.\", and \"The internet facilitates these interactions.\" When attempting to split these into paragraphs, some paragraphs would contain only a single sentence or even just a part of one, which does not meet the requirement for a sufficient amount of text to form three distinct paragraphs. Therefore, the input fails to satisfy this aspect of the specification. Furthermore, while the sentences provide some keywords and phrases that could potentially use emphasis tags, the main issue is with paragraph sufficiency.\n\nERR"
