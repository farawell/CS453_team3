I applied them to key nouns like \"Knowledge\" and \"resources,\" and important verbs like \"creates.\"\n    * `<em>` tags are used for milder emphasis, highlighting specific words within a phrase. For example, \"sharing,\" \"growth,\" and \"beneficial\" get this treatment.\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore more HTML formatting options!",
