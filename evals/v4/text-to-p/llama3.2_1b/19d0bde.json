  "evaluation": "The chatbot output is expected to comply with the following criteria from the description:\n\n1. Each sentence should be wrapped in a `<p>` tag.\n2. There should be at least three `<p>` tags.\n3. Each `<p>` tag should contain one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags.\n\nUpon evaluating the output:\n\n- The first `<p>` tag contains `<strong>` tags but violates description expectations by having two `<strong>` tags, and it also has no `<em>` tags.\n- The second block appears to have an incomplete syntax with the use of template literals `{{#if *native* then <em>pandas</em></p>`. This snippet is incorrectly formatted as the closing `</p>` tag precedes the use of the `<em>` tag, which means the emphasis is not actually within a `<p>` tag properly in HTML.\n- The output does not have at least three complete `<p>` tags as per the requirement. There are only two `<p>` tags, one closed incorrectly and the other ending with a comment indicating incomplete output.\n\nThus, the output is non-compliant with the description due to incorrect HTML structuring, excessive use of `<strong>` tags without `<em>`, incorrect use of HTML5 features without appropriate context, and not meeting the minimum requirement of three `<p>` tags. \n\nERR"
