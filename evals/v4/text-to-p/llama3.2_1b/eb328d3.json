  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output includes four <p> tags, which satisfies the requirement of having at least three <p> tags. Each <p> tag contains at least one <strong> tag, which is consistent with the description's requirement to add a <strong> tag inside each <p> tag. Furthermore, there are multiple <em> tags used to emphasize key words or phrases, complying with the guideline to include multiple <em> tags within each <p> tag.\n\nBased on the provided output, the formatting appears to meet the expectations outlined in the description. No part of the evaluation requires checking whether each sentence was correctly wrapped with a <p> tag, as such checks depend on input and hence are beyond the scope of evaluation.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
