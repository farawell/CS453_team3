  "output": "**<p>The globalisation has a significant impact on the economies.</p>\n\n**<strong>A</strong> fundamental aspect of globalization is **emerging economics**. These are economies that have grown apart from developed economies, often with their own unique characteristics and challenges.\n\n&#x20;Economies in developing countries may adopt **free market policies**, which can lead to increased **productivity** and **growth**.\n\nMeanwhile, economies in developed countries may experience **convergence**, where they move closer together due to trade liberalization and other globalization factors.\n\nInternational cooperation is often necessary to address the challenges posed by globalization. For example, the Asian-Australian Free Trade Area (AFTA) aims to reduce tariffs and facilitate trade between these two regions.\n\nThe impact of globalization on cultures is also complex. On one hand, it can provide new opportunities for people to **explore different cultures** and learn from each other's experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, globalization can also lead to cultural **hybridization**, where different cultures blend together to create a unique cultural identity.\n\nIn many cases, globalization leads to the spread of **languages**, as people move around the world or communicate through technology.",

  "evaluation": "The output does not meet the requirements outlined in the description. Firstly, the text starts with a single `<p>` tag, but it does not wrap each sentence in its own `<p>` tag throughout the rest of the text. The subsequent sentences are not individually encapsulated within `<p>` tags. Secondly, not all `<p>` tags contain at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags for key words and phrases, as required. Overall, the expectations for structuring the output with at least three `<p>` tags, each incorporating `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, are not met in this output.\n\nERR"
