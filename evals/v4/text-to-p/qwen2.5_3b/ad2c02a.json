The output only contains one `<p>` tag enclosing multiple sentences. Although there is usage of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, the primary requirement of wrapping each sentence in a separate `<p>` tag is not met, and further, there are not three `<p>` tags as required by the description. \n\nTherefore, the output violates the rules stated in the description for formatting the text properly according to the given guidelines.\n\nERR"
