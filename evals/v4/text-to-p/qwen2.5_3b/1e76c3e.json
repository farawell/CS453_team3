The third paragraph lacks any `<em>` tags, violating the description's requirement of using one `<strong>` and multiple `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag. \n\nThis analysis identifies a violation regarding the use of `<em>` tags within the third paragraph, which does not comply with the description.\n\nERR"
