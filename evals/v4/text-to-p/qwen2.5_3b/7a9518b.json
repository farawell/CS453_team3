  "input": "Cloud computing services are flexible. They reduce costs. Security in cloud technology is advancing.",
  "output": "Sure, here is the formatted paragraph with appropriate HTML tags:\n\n```html\n<p><strong>Cloud</strong> computing <em>services</em> are <em>flexible</em>. They <em>reduce</em> <em>costs</em>. <em>Security</em> in <em>cloud</em> technology is <em>advancing</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloud</strong> computing <em>services</em> are <em>flexible</em>.

  "compliance": "ok",
  "evaluation": "The output comprises three `<p>` tags, each containing multiple `<em>` tags and one `<strong>` tag per paragraph, which complies with the structural requirements described.\n\nHowever, the content inside each `<p>` tag is identical, which suggests that only one unique sentence or group of sentences was used repeatedly. This aspect of compliance cannot be fully assessed without knowledge of the input. As per the description, it is necessary to only check rules which do not require knowing the input. Since the rules regarding the variety of sentences within `<p>` tags require input knowledge, I am ignoring this part.\n\nSince the requirements specified in the task description are fulfilled with the repetition being something requiring additional input information to determine compliance, the conclusion is that there is no explicit non-compliance with the formatting instructions given.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
