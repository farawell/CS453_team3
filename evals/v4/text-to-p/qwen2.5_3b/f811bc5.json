In this example, \"time\" was selected as a keyword to emphasize, along with the expected main message which was \"Personal expression is key.\" If further refinement of the terms were needed, those should be identified according to context and meaning.",

  "evaluation": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description for several reasons:\n\n1. **Minimum Sentence Requirement:** The description specifies that there should be at least three `<p>` tags, each containing an individual sentence from the paragraph. The output provided includes only one `<p>` tag, which clearly indicates a failure to meet the requirement.\n\n2. **Use of `<strong>` and `<em>` Tags:** Although the output does use `<strong>` tags to emphasize certain words and an `<em>` tag for part of a sentence, the description requires these tags to be used within each `<p>` tag to emphasize key words and phrases. Without knowing the input, I can't verify if enough keywords have been emphasized with these tags, but the minimum requirement of sentence separation and formatting has not been met.\n\nThe output lacks the requisite number of wrapped sentences and fails to comply with the formatting rules outlined in the description.\n\nERR"
