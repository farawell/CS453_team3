Each <p> tag contains a <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags, which complies with the requirement to wrap individual sentences in <p> tags and to include one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each <p> tag. Given that the requirement was to have at least three <p> tags, this output exceeds that minimum requirement by having six <p> tags.\n\nThere are no other explicit rules or requirements outlined in the description that are violated here when the determination doesn't rely on the input. As such, without needing to check for correctness which involves knowing the input, the output is compliant.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
