Furthermore, each `<p>` tag includes a `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which aligns with the formatting directives given in the description. Although the repeated content may raise questions about correctness or redundancy, it does not violate any of the given rules, as input-based checks are out of scope. The presence of six `<p>` tags exceeds the minimum requirement of three `<p>` tags, showing compliance with the directive to format at least three sentences.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
