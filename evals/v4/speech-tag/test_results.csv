Upon examination, it seems that the standard output formatting expected (returning just the tag) is not followed here as additional text precedes the tag. Additionally, the requirement to provide the tag only is not met because the format includes a phrase instead of only returning the tag itself. Therefore, instead of providing just the tags (e.g., ""VB,"" ""CD,"" ""NN,"" ""DT""), the response includes descriptive text (""Part-of-speech tag for word 'x':"") before each tag, which is against the return format specified in the description.

Based on this analysis, the output does not comply with the description's requirement to only return the part-of-speech tag. 

As a result, the reasoning and decision are as follows:
The decision is made because the output includes additional text beyond just the part-of-speech tags. The given task requires the output to be solely the tag, without prefacing text or format.
