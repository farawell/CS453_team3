  "evaluation": "The chatbot output includes additional explanations and context beyond what is required by the description. According to the instructions, the response should consist solely of the part-of-speech tag. Moreover, the tag \"JJS\" (Adjective, superlative) may not suit the word \"doing,\" but since correctness is not within our evaluation scope, we should not consider that aspect. However, the presence of explanations and formatting—specifically, the use of the boxed answer—diverges from the explicit requirement to return only the tag.\n\nERR"
