In the second section, the word \"turquoises\" is tagged with \"JJR,\" which stands for \"Adjective, comparative,\" and this is indeed a valid part-of-speech tag.\n\nHowever, without knowledge of the input sentence and context, it is not possible to determine the correctness of these tags. Therefore, if correctness was meant, it's not for the evaluation. \n\nThe output includes part-of-speech tags only, and all tags used are part of the provided list, thus the output complies with the requirements by tagging words and returning the specified part-of-speech tags from the given list. There are no invalid or missing tags.\n\nNo violations are found based on the description's compliance requirements.\nOK"
