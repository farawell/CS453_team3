  "evaluation": "The chatbot output consists of several steps where it attempts to determine the part of speech for given words. Here's the evaluation based on the provided description:\n\n1. **Interjection for \"Wow\"**: The chatbot correctly identifies \"Wow\" as an interjection; however, the part-of-speech tag it should return is 'UH', not 'Interjection'. The output must only contain the tag, not a description.\n\n2. **Preposition for \"That's\"**: The chatbot incorrectly identifies \"That's\" as a preposition. While checking the correctness is not possible without input, it uses 'Preposition' instead of a tag. Moreover, even if it was correct, it should return 'IN', the tag for prepositions.\n\n3. **Adjective for \"incredible\"**: The chatbot outputs 'Adjective' rather than returning the appropriate tag 'JJ'.\n\nAdditionally, the chatbot provides detailed explanations for each determination, which is not in compliance with the request to only return the tag.\n\nViolation: The chatbot fails to return the proper part-of-speech tags uniformly and adds unnecessary explanations.\n\nERR"
