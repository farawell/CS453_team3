  "output": "Part of speech tag for \"sitting\" is VB.\n\nPart of speech tag for \"table\" is NN. \n\nSo, answer:\nVB NN",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "evaluation": "The chatbot output consists of two part-of-speech tags, \"VB\" and \"NN\". According to the guidelines, the chatbot is required to return only the part of speech tag for a given word. \n\nIf more than one word is present, then multiple tags are returned inline. The output seems to align with the expectation that only the part of speech tags are returned, and it does not provide any additional information or explanation, which is compliant.\n\nBased on this evaluation of the text provided, the output complies with the description because it adheres to the requirement to only return the part of speech tags for the words.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
