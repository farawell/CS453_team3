The task specifies that the output should only return the part of speech tag, without additional explanations or formatting. Moreover, the part of speech tag \"ADJ\" does not conform to the list of specified tags provided in the chatbot description. The correct tag from the given list would have been \"JJ\", \"JJR\", or \"JJS\" for adjectives, based on their form (adjective, comparative, or superlative). Therefore, the output violates the task requirements. \n\nERR"
