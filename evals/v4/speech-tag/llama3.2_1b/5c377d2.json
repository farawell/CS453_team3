  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output \"Determiner/NNN\" does not comply with the description. According to the provided description, the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag, such as \"DT\" for Determiner. However, the output provided is \"Determiner/NNN,\" which seems to combine a description (Determiner) and an incorrect non-standard tag (\"NNN\"). As per the guidelines, if the word cannot be tagged with the listed standard tags, the chatbot should return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer.\" The presence of \"NNN\" suggests a non-standard, unrecognized part of speech tag, which violates the description's instruction to use only the listed tags.\n\nERR"
