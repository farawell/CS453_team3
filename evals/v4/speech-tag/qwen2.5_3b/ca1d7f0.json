Therefore, this output complies with the description. There's no information that suggests a violation because the output matches the expected format of a part-of-speech tag. The description includes what to do in case a word cannot be tagged or when the chatbot is unable to tag a word (return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\"), but none of these exceptions are evident or apply here.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
