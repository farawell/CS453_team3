According to the task description, the expectation is for the chatbot to return a part of speech tag for a given word, or \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged, or \"CantAnswer\" if it's unable to tag the word. The output \"WP\" indeed conforms to one of the specified part of speech tags from the provided list (WP: Wh-pronoun). \n\nAs the evaluation does not require knowing if \"WP\" is the correct tag for the word within the given sentence, and only concerns whether the output aligns with the listed tags or specified responses, the chatbot's response complies with the description requirements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
