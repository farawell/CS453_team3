  "evaluation": "The output provided is \"CantAnswer\" which is one of the two permissible outputs according to the description for cases where a tag cannot be provided. Since I don't have the input (the sentence and the word within it), I can't check if \"Incredible\" truly qualifies for \"CantAnswer\" by verifying if it indeed cannot be tagged with any of the listed tags. However, the output \"CantAnswer\" is allowable per the rules outlined, as it specifically directs to use \"CantAnswer\" if unable to tag the word with the list provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
