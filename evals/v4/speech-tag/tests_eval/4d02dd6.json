  "coverage": "Adverb",
  "validity": "The input given consists of two separate elements: a sentence and a specified word for analysis. \n\n1. **Complete Sentence Compliance**: \n   - The sentence provided is \"She said something indistinctly.\" This is a complete sentence as it has a subject (\"She\"), a verb (\"said\"), and an object/phrase (\"something indistinctly\"). It is grammatically correct and expresses a complete thought. \n\n2. **Specified Word for Analysis**:\n   - The input includes a specified word, which is \"indistinctly.\" The word \"indistinctly\" is indeed a part of the provided sentence.\n\nBased on these observations, the input meets both requirements:\n- It contains a complete sentence.\n- It specifies a word from within that sentence for analysis.\n\nThere are no violations of the input specification.\n\nOK"
