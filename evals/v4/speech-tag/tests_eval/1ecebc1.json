  "input": "Sentence: \"She moved to New York last year.\"  \nWord: \"New York\"",
  "coverage": "Proper Noun",
  "validity": "The input provided includes a complete sentence: \"She moved to New York last year.\" This complies with the requirement that the input must contain a complete sentence. Additionally, the input specifies a single word for analysis: \"New York.\" However, according to standard conventions, a \"word\" is typically considered a single unit without spaces, and \"New York\" comprises two words. Therefore, this does not comply with the input specification that requires a \"single specified word\" for analysis.\n\nThis evaluation led to the conclusion that the input does not comply with the specification due to the violation of the requirement for a single word, as \"New York\" is a phrase of two words.\n\nERR"
