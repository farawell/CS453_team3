The description requires returning just the tag for the word's part of speech and nothing more. Since \"IN\" is a valid part of speech tag from the provided list and matches the format required by the description, the output complies with the requirements. There are no additional elements provided that violate the required output format, and no contextual information from the input is necessary to check this compliance.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
