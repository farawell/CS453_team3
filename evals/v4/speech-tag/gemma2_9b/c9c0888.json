Since the evaluation is based solely on checking the alignment of the provided output with the prescribed list of tags, this output complies with the chatbot description. There is no information given that would require checking whether the output correctly identifies the part of speech, thus we only verify if \"MD\" is within the allowed set of tags. \"MD\" is on the list, so compliance is achieved.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
