The description states that the output should return just the tag for the word's part of speech. The chatbot follows this rule by providing only the tag and nothing else. Since the compliance checks do not require validation against input, we cannot assess if this tag is correct for a given word, but that is irrelevant to compliance.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
