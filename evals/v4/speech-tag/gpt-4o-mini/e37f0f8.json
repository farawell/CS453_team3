According to the description, the output should be a part of speech tag from the specified list. \"MD\" is one of the listed tags, standing for \"Modal\". The output is provided in the correct format with no additional text or deviations. Without the input, I cannot verify the correctness of the tag assignment, but correctness is not the focus; compliance in terms of format and adherence to the listed tags is what matters.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
