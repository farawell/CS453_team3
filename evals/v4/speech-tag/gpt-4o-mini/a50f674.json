The task of the chatbot is to return only the part of speech tag for a given word or specify \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if the word cannot be tagged or if the chatbot is unable to tag the word, respectively. Since \"WP\" is an acceptable part of speech tag and there are no additional elements in the output that violate the guidelines, the output complies with the description. Therefore, no violations are present.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
