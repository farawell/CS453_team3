The task specifies that the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag or one of the special responses (\"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\") if the word cannot be tagged or if the tagging can't be performed. Since \"DT\" is a recognized tag (\"Determiner\"), it complies with the requirement to return a part-of-speech tag from the specified list.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
