According to the description, the task requires returning only the part of speech tag associated with a given word from a sentence, or specific outputs like \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if applicable. Since \"RB\" is a part of speech tag representing an adverb, and the output consists solely of this tag, it complies with the requirement to return just the tag. The output does not contain any additional information or incorrect format, which matches the guidelines provided in the description. There's also no indication to suggest that the word couldn't be tagged, which would require different output as specified in the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
