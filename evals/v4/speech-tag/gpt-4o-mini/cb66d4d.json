The output should solely consist of a part of speech tag from the specified list in the description.\n2. If the part of speech of the given word cannot be categorized under the specified tags, the output should be \"Unknown\".\n3. If the chatbot is unable to determine the part of speech, the output should be \"CantAnswer\".\n\nGiven that \"NN\" is a valid part of speech tag listed in the description, it complies with the description that asks for only the tag to be returned. There are no additional words or information provided with it, and \"NN\" fits the required criteria as per the provided list.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
