The output does not include anything other than a part of speech tag, and it does not present any additional information or violate the rules stated. Given that my evaluation focuses solely on compliance without needing to verify correctness (which requires input), there appears to be no reason to conclude non-compliance with the provided description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
