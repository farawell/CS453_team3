The output consists of only the part of speech tag as required by the description. Since I don't have the input, I cannot verify if \"NN\" is the correct tag for the word in the sentence, but compliance is about form rather than correctness. Based on the description given, the output is in the correct format.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
