According to the description provided, the task is to determine the part of speech for a given word and return its tag. The output meets this requirement by only providing the tag itself, without additional explanation or content.\n\nSince the description allows for several responses, such as returning a tag or specific other responses if tagging is not possible, and \"RB\" is a valid tag from the list provided, the output is compliant with the given rules. There is no indication or evidence here of non-compliance strictly based on the format or requirement to return a tag.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
