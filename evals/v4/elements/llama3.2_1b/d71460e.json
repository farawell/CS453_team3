  "evaluation": "The chatbot output should include extracted information presented in a specific format as outlined in the description:\n\n1. The output must list \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes\" in the order specified.\n2. The descriptions provided in the lists should be formatted as comma-separated lists (in relation to company names and people names).\n3. The use of \"None\" for \"People names\" appears consistent, as there would be no names to list in that section.\n4. Each section is correctly labeled, and the sections are present in the specified order.\n\nHowever, the chatbot might have included topics directly in the extracted topics section with little explanation or categorization. Despite this, it doesn't violate any described instructions because it doesn't state the need to avoid redundancy in representation. \n\nOverall, the output adheres to the structural compliance criteria specified. While correctness regarding provided data cannot be verified without input details, structural compliance is maintained.\n\nOK"
