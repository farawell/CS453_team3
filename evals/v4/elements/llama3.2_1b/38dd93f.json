  "evaluation": "The output is not in direct compliance with the expected format as specified in the chatbot description. According to the description, the output should be formatted under clear headers with comma-separated lists for each category: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. \n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n1. The output doesn't consistently use the prescribed format. The ideal format should strictly be:\n    - **Company names:** <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n    - **People names:** <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\n    - **Specific topics:** <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\n    - **General themes:** <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n   \n2. The output uses markdown-style headers (## Step 1: Extract Company Names), and lists which deviates from the required format.\n\n3. There is an inconsistency since there are no people names mentioned in the initial extraction phase, but names are later included in the \"People names\" section as 'Jamie Dimon, Michael Corbat'.\n\nThese inconsistencies indicate that the output does not strictly comply with the format and structure prescribed in the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
