  "evaluation": "The chatbot output provides a list of company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. According to the description format, \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes\" should be followed by comma-separated lists or, if none, an indication of 'none'. However, the output uses bullet points instead of a comma-separated list. The section \"People names\" effectively communicates that there are none, but it includes additional text \"in this particular text,\" which is not specified in the guidelines. The compliance is based on format, so using bullet points instead of commas represents a deviation. Due to these points, the output doesn't match the described format.\n\nERR"
