  "evaluation": "The chatbot output does not comply with the given description for a few reasons. \n\n1. The section titles in the output ('Step 1: Extract Company Names', 'Step 2: Extract People Names', etc.) do not match the desired format specified in the description. The description specifies that the output should be formatted with labels directly followed by a comma-separated list (or text) highlighted by the requested output format such as \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\". Instead, the output lays out the items in a numbered bullet-point format which deviates from the specified pattern.\n\n2. In the \"People Names\" section, it states \"There is only one person mentioned in the text:\" followed by two names. This is inconsistent and shouldn't be phrased that way according to the description which implies listing names in a comma-separated format without additional phrases.\n\n3. The general themes are not separately delineated with a label as per the preferred format (\"General themes: <comma_separated_list>\").\n\nTherefore, based on these points, the output does not adhere to the specified format from the description.\n\nERR"
