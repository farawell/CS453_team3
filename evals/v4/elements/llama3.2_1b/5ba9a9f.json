  "evaluation": "The evaluation is based on whether the output follows the format and elements described. The output should contain four categories: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. These should be presented as comma-separated lists for the company and people names, while topics and themes can be freeform.\n\n1. **Company names**: The format is correct, as they are presented as a comma-separated list.\n2. **People names**: The format deviates from the requirement because the names are listed with hyphens, not as a comma-separated list as specified in the description. \n3. **Specific topics and General themes**: Both categories are listed separately and appropriately, matching the expected format.\n\nTherefore, the violation occurs with the presentation of people names, which does not comply with the requested format of a comma-separated list.\n\nPeople names are supposed to be in a comma-separated list, but the output presents them with bullet points, which is not compliant with the description. This deviation led to the decision of non-compliance.\n\nERR"
