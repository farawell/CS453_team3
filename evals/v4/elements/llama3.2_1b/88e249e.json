  "evaluation": "The chatbot output is expected to follow a specific structured format for presenting extracted entities, as mentioned in the description. The expected format is:\n\n```\nCompany names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\nPeople names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\nSpecific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\nGeneral themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n```\n\nExamining the given output, it does not comply with the prescribed format in several ways:\n\n1. **Format for Company Names**: Instead of listing company names in the expected format, the output includes a note \"(just mentions two company names: Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline)\" which deviates from the expected comma-separated list.\n\n2. **Lack of Comma-Separated List**: All sections (Company names, People names, Specific topics, General themes) should present extracted items as a comma-separated list, but the provided output uses bullet points which is not in compliance with the expected format.\n\nDue to these discrepancies in the format related to the explicitly stated description, the chatbot's output does not comply with the guidelines.\n\nERR"
