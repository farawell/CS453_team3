The description requires a specific format for the output: \n\n1. **Company names**: Should be listed as a comma-separated list following \"Company names: \".\n2. **People names**: Should be listed as a comma-separated list following \"People names: \".\n3. **Specific topics**: Should be listed as a comma-separated list following \"Specific topics: \".\n4. **General themes**: Should be listed as a comma-separated list following \"General themes: \".\n\nIn the output provided:\n\n- The company names section is correctly stated as none are mentioned.\n- The people names section does not follow the specified format. Instead, it states \"- -||-\", which was meant to represent \"comma_separated_list_of_people_names\".\n- The specific topics section does not precede with the required text \"Specific topics: \", and instead uses \"Text: \".\n- Similar issue exists for general themes, which also uses \"Text: \".\n\nThese deviations from the prescribed format indicate non-compliance with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
