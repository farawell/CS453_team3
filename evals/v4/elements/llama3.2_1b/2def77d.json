The chatbot is supposed to extract elements from a text such as company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. Instead, the output is essentially a disclaimer stating what type of content it cannot provide. No attempt is made to extract or list any entities or themes, which is the core requirement described. Therefore, the output does not adhere to the requirements laid out in the description.\n\nERR"
