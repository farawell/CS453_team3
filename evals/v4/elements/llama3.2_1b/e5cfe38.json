  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the format specified in the description. According to the description, the desired format for the output should be a structured presentation with specific sections labeled as \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\", each followed by a comma-separated list. However, the output provided is in a step-by-step narrative form rather than the specified format. Specifically:\n\n- The output is organized in \"Step 1\", \"Step 2\", etc., rather than using labels such as \"Company names:\", \"People names:\", etc.\n- It does not use comma-separated lists where applicable.\n- The output adds unnecessary narrative elements that are not part of the required output format.\n\nBecause the output does not adhere to the specified format in the chatbot description, it does not comply with the requirements.\n\nERR"
