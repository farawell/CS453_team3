The description specifies a particular format for the output: \n\n1. \"Company names:\" followed by a comma-separated list of company names.\n2. \"People names:\" followed by a comma-separated list of people names.\n3. \"Specific topics:\" followed by a comma-separated list of specific topics.\n4. \"General themes:\" followed by a comma-separated list of general overarching themes.\n\nThe chatbot's output did not follow this specified format:\n\n- For company names and people names, the format used includes a section header followed by an individual name, instead of using the phrase \"Company names:\" or \"People names:\" with a comma-separated list.\n- For specific topics and general themes, the format used includes a section header and bullet points instead of comma-separated lists.\n\nWhile the content of the output might be correct (this cannot be evaluated without knowing the input), the evaluation is based solely on format compliance. As a result of these format discrepancies, the output does not meet the explicit format requirements given in the description.\n\nERR"
