  "evaluation": "The output does not comply with the desired format as described in the chatbot's description. Here are the issues:\n\n1. **Company Names Extraction**: The section under \"Company Names\" incorrectly includes a person's name, \"Dara Khosrowshahi,\" instead of a company name, which violates the proper allocation of entities under company names.\n\n2. **Formatting Errors**: \n   - For \"Company Names,\" the required format is a comma-separated list, but instead, it uses \"-||-\" incorrectly, and the same separator issue is present after the person named Dara Khosrowshahi in the \"People Names\" section.\n\n3. **People Names Section**: The section includes \"Dara Khosrowshahi,\" which is correct, but it incorrectly follows with \"-||-\" instead of listing another name or leaving the space empty if no other names are extracted.\n\nBased on these observations, the output fails to comply with the extraction and formatting guidelines specified in the chatbot's description.\n\nERR"
