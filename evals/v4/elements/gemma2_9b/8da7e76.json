  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output follows the desired format outlined in the description. The output provides sections for \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes\" with each list being comma-separated as per the description guidelines. There is nothing in the description that prohibits the chatbot from adding a polite offer to analyze more text at the end, so this does not count as a violation. Thus, based on the description alone, without needing to verify the accuracy of the details provided, the format complies fully with the directives provided in the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
