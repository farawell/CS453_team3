  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output needs to comply with the format specified in the description. The necessary format is:\n\n```\nCompany names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\nPeople names: -||-\nSpecific topics: -||-\nGeneral themes: -||-\n```\n\nThe given output does have a structure, but it is not in the correct format. Instead of following the specified format with commas and separators, it uses bullet points and markdown styling for lists, which does not match the required format. The absence of a response for \"People names\" is also noted, but it is acceptable as it may be an empty list depending on input. However, the main issue is the deviation from the format with unnecessary styling.\n\nSince the description clearly specifies a particular format and the chatbot's output does not follow this prescribed structure, it violates the description.\n\nERR"
