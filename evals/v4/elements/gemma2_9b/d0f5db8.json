  "evaluation": "The chatbot output lists elements under four categories: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. The format matches the required structure with labels followed by lists. The output includes:\n\n1. **Company names**: There are no company names listed, which aligns with the format that should include this category, even if empty.\n2. **People names**: Sam Wilson and Emily Clark are listed.\n3. **Specific topics**: Includes \"Speakers at an event\".\n4. **General themes**: Contains \"Events, Attendees\".\n\nThe output follows the exact format required by the instructions with categories and a comma-separated format where applicable. There's no requirement for there to be content under each category if the input doesn't specify them, so the empty company names list is acceptable based on the format. The output complies with the structure described in the instructions and fulfills the category listing.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
