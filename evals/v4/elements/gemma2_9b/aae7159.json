  "evaluation": "The chatbot output is formatted according to the desired format specified in the description. The output lists entities under \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes,\" which aligns with the requirements of the task. The additional line \"Let me know if you want to analyze another text!\" does not interfere with the compliance to the desired format as it is an additional prompt not affecting the listing of extracted elements. Thus, there are no violations in output formatting.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
