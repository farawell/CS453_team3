  "evaluation": "The chatbot output is structured as specified in the desired format: it lists categories for \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" However, there is an inconsistency in the output. The note mentions \"Sundar Pichai and Sheryl Sandberg\" should be categorized under \"People names,\" but they are not included in the \"People names\" section. Instead, the \"People names\" section is incorrectly formatted as \"-||-\" without listing any names, even though the note implies there are names to include.\n\nSince the output does not comply with the specific format requirements mentioned in the description due to this inconsistency, it is not fully compliant.\n\nERR"
