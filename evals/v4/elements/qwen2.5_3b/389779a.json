Key topics included trade policies and sustainable energy, while the overarching theme was global cooperation.\"",
  "output": "Company names: Siemens, Renault, Adidas\nPeople names: -||-\nSpecific topics: trade policies, sustainable energy\nGeneral themes: global cooperation",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "evaluation": "The chatbot output is structured according to the required format: it provides a list of company names, a placeholder for people names, lists specific topics, and provides general themes. However, there should be a comma-separated list or a placeholder after \"People names:\". The placeholder '-||-' is used instead, which aligns with the desired format when no names are extracted. \n\nThus, the output seems to comply with the description as laid out. There is no element that clearly violates the format or requirements specified in the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
