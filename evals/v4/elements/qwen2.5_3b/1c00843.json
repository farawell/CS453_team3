  "evaluation": "The output does not comply with the desired format specified in the chatbot description. The \"Company names\" section lists \"cybersecurity,\" which appears to be a topic rather than a company name. Additionally, the other fields (\"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes\") are left with placeholders (\"-||-\"), which does not conform to the description, as the format requires these fields to be filled with specific extracted information. Since the presented content doesn't comply with the specified desired format and intent for the fields, it violates the chatbot's description.\n\nERR"
