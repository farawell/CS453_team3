  "output": "Company names: Ford,Volkswagen\nPeople names: -||-\nSpecific topics: -||-\nGeneral themes: Changes in the automotive industry, Electric Vehicles, Autonomous Driving, Intelligent Transportation",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "evaluation": "The chatbot output is provided in the desired format described in the description. It includes sections for \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes,\" each separated by a colon and followed by a list or placeholder according to the instructions. The only aspect missing is the listing format for \"People names\" and \"Specific topics\" where the placeholder \"-||-\" should be used to explicitly denote that no entities were found in those categories.\n\nThe issues in the chatbot's output are:\n- For \"People names\" and \"Specific topics,\" the format explicitly requires the placeholder \"-||-\" if no entities are listed, and this requirement is correctly satisfied in the output.\n\nBased solely on the requirement that does not depend on input knowledge, the chatbot output complies with the format expectations specified in the description.\n\nTherefore, the output adheres to the given structure and does not violate any specified elements required by the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
