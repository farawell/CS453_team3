However, there is a non-compliance issue:\n  - In the \"Specific topics\" section, 'sundar pichai', which is a person's name, is included. This should not be here according to the desired categories outlined in the task. Specific topics should not mix people names with topics.\n  \nGiven this violation, the output does not fully comply with the guidelines provided in the description.\n\nERR"
