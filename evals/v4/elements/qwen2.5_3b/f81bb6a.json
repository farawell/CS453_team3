It includes four sections: \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\", and each section is followed by some content. While it might be debatable whether \"startups\" is a specific company name, this determination would require knowledge of the input text, which is outside the current evaluation scope. Without the input, we cannot determine functional correctness, so we are limited to evaluating format compliance. The given output adheres to the specified structure.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
