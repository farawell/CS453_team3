  "evaluation": "The output from the chatbot does not comply with the description provided. According to the desired format specified in the description, the output must list company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes explicitly separated by \"-||-\" after each extracted element section. \n\nIn the output, the sections for \"Company names\" and \"General themes\" are not followed by \"-||-\", instead, they are just left empty. This results in formatting non-compliance. Additionally, the expected format indicates that each section should be clearly delineated using \"-||-\", regardless of whether content is present.\n\nThus, the violation here is a formatting issue where the output does not adhere to the specified structure because not all the sections properly conclude with \"-||-\", even when they are empty.\n\nERR"
