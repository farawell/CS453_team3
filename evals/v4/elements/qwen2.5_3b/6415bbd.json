  "input": "Text: \"Automobile tech pioneers like Uber and Lyft, steered by Dara Khosrowshahi and Logan Green, face issues in ride-sharing safety and urban transportation, indicating a theme of mobility evolution.\"",
  "output": "Company names: Uber, Lyft\nPeople names: \n-||-\nSpecific topics: \n-||-\nGeneral themes: Mobility Evolution",
  "compliance": "err",
  "evaluation": "The chatbot output is mostly in line with the desired format given in the description. It starts with \"Company names:\" followed by a comma-separated list. Then, it has \"People names:\" with no names provided, but instead of correctly using the \"-||-\" as indicated, it leaves this section empty. It omits the phrase \"Specific topics:\" but again uses the \"-||-\" symbol correctly afterward. Finally, the format of \"General themes:\" is followed properly. The main issue here is that the phrase \"Specific topics:\" is missing, which is part of the specified format.\n\nHence, the output does not fully comply with the format requested in the description due to the missing label \"Specific topics:\".\n\nERR"
