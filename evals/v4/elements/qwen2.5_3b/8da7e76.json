Topics such as digital streaming, artist contracts, and revenue models lead to the general theme of digital transformation in music.\"",

  "compliance": "ok",
  "evaluation": "The chatbot output follows most parts of the required format, as it lists the categories such as \"Company names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" However, the section \"People names: -||-\" simply repeats the prompt placeholder pattern, which suggests that no people names were extracted or the section might have been overlooked if there were people names present in the text. Given that we cannot determine if people names should have been included without knowing the input text, this aspect remains undecidable. Therefore, based on direct compliance with the provided output format, the response appears correct as it aligns with the given structure.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
