It begins with \"Company names:\" followed by a list of company names separated by commas. Then, it follows with \"People names:\" also presented in a comma-separated list. Subsequently, it lists \"Specific topics:\" and \"General themes:\" in a similar incorrect format. Therefore, focusing only on formatting compliance and not correctness or accuracy (as the input isn't provided), the chatbot output is in alignment with the format expectations of the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
