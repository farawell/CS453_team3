  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output includes the sections requested in the desired format: \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" \n\n- The section \"Company names\" includes a comma-separated list of companies: Microsoft, Google.\n- The \"People names\" section follows the format but indicates with the placeholder \"-||-\" that there are no names extracted, which complies even though I can't verify correctness.\n- The \"Specific topics\" section lists \"innovation,\" fitting the descriptor format by providing a topic.\n- The \"General themes\" section lists \"technology, leadership,\" which aligns with the format for presenting general themes with comma-separated entries.\n\nThe output appears to follow the required format strictly without any deviations. Therefore, based on structure and format compliance, it adheres to the description guidelines.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
