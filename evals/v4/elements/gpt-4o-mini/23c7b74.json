In this output, the section for company names is left incomplete, as there is no list or indication of company names (even if the input did not contain any, some form of placeholder like \"None\" could be expected).\n\nTherefore, the output does not meet the expected format described, leading to a conclusion of non-compliance.\n\nERR"
