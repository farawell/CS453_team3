However, the \"Company names\" and \"People names\" categories are empty. The compliance evaluation doesn't rely on the correctness regarding whether there should be any content in these lists, as it requires knowledge about the input text, which is not provided. \n\nThe output format resembles the described format. Despite the absence of company and people names, this does not constitute a non-compliance because the description does not mandate that these categories must have entries; it only spells out the format to be followed, which has been adhered to since there is no explicit rule broken from the description in the absence of input context.\n\nTherefore, based purely on format adherence and structure, there is no explicit non-compliance with the description requirement.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
