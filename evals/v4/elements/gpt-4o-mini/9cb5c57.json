According to the given description, the output should list company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes extracted from the input text. The desired format requires a comma-separated list for each category. \n\n1. **Company names**: The output provides \"Company names:\" followed by a blank space, indicating no company names were extracted. While the format is followed (with a comma-separated list), it might not match what was expected, but compliance is based on format, not correctness.\n\n2. **People names**: The output presents \"People names: Jane Doe, John Smith\" in the required format, with names being comma-separated.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The output lists \"Specific topics: insights\" in the required format.\n\n4. **General themes**: The output lists \"General themes: expert opinions, analysis\" in the required format, with themes being comma-separated.\n\nThe output format complies with the description: it lists categories in the specified order and uses the comma-separated format for each list. Without access to the input text, correctness regarding the actual content of each list cannot be evaluated, but format compliance is achieved.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
