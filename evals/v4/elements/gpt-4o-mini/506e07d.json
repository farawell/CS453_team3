According to the desired format outlined in the description, the chatbot output should provide:\n\n1. A comma-separated list for each category: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes.\n2. Each category should have the appropriate label followed by a colon.\n\nUpon examining the output:\n\n- The \"Company names\" and \"People names\" categories are present but are empty, which is acceptable as it does not require a comma-separated list if there are no entities to list.\n- The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" categories have a comma-separated list as required.\n\nThe output format matches the desired format specified in the description. The absence of entities in some categories is permissible as the format is adhered to.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
