It includes sections for \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" Each section is present in the output, even though \"Company names\" and \"People names\" are left empty, which is acceptable if no relevant entities were found in the text. The sections for \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" are filled with appropriate entries, maintaining the expected format.\n\nNo compliance violations are noted based only on format adherence, as the correctness of extracted entities cannot be evaluated without the input text.\n\nOK"
