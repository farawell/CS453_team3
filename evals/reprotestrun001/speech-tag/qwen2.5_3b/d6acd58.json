  "output": "NNÂº\nNote: This task involves determining the part-of-speech for a given word within a sentence. In this case, \"Mary\" is typically identified as a proper noun (NNNP), singular (NNS). However, based on typical English usage in this context (\"John and Mary went to the library\"), it often functioned more like a common noun here. Therefore, I'll provide \"NN\" as the most appropriate tag indicating a singular noun.\n\nSo, the part-of-speech tag for \"Mary\" would be: NN",
