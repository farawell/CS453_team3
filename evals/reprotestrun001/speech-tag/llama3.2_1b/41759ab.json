In this case, some sources may not consider it adverbial or comparative. Therefore, I've returned NS (no specific function).",

The output also includes a \"Note\" section which is not part of the instructions.\nERR\n\nThe chatbot output does not comply with the description because it provides multiple tags instead of a single tag, and it provides extra explanation text which is not allowed based on the description."
