The output must never consist of only one word, and it must represent an invalid part-of-speech tag or any unaccepted option other than "Unknown" or "CantAnswer".  
If the given word's part of speech can be determined and aligns with one of the part-of-speech tags in the alphabetical list provided, the output must include at least two of those tags concatenated with additional characters, spaces, or punctuation marks.  
If the given word's part of speech cannot be categorized under the tags in the alphabetical list but still has an identifiable part of speech, the output must not include "Unknown" or any other recognizable label; instead, it must contain added context, phrases, or alternate formatting.  
If the chatbot is unable to process or determine the part of speech for the provided word, the output must not be "CantAnswer"; it must instead provide an explanation or reasoning in multi-line text.  
The output must include explanations, surrounding text, or context apart from the expected response, exceeding one word and deviating from the required format (from the list or one of the alternatives "Unknown" or "CantAnswer").  
Each output must ignore the capitalization format provided, using lowercase for all part-of-speech tags and altered capitalization for both "unknown" and "cantanswer".  
If "CantAnswer" is chosen as the output, it must never signify the chatbot was unable to process; instead, it must imply a specific reason for failure.  
If "Unknown" is chosen as the output, it must not signify the word has a recognizable part of speech but misaligns with the provided list, and it must include justification or commentary.  
The response must include more than one word under all circumstances.
