It also includes a specific model name (QuantumNet), which complies with the input specification allowing technical terms, acronyms, and specific model names. Additionally, it is a textual string comprised of a sentence that would typically be found in an academic paper abstract. There are no indications of non-compliance with the input specification.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output is an array with the format [\"model_name\"], which is consistent with the requirement to extract model names and return them in the specified format. Since I am not aware of the input, I cannot determine if \"QuantumNet\" is actually a model name from the abstract. However, the format matches the requirement, and no rules are explicitly broken based on the description provided. Therefore, the output complies with the given description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
