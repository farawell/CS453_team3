This input is explicitly labeled as an \"Abstract,\" suggesting that it is indeed derived from one. It includes a sentence typical of machine learning papers, describing an architecture named ProtonNet and mentioning benchmarking tasks, which can be considered a technical term relevant to the field. Hence, this input complies with the input specification as it resembles a concise part of a machine learning paper abstract.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output is [\"ProtonNet\"], which is consistent with the expected output format described in the guidelines where the response should be an array of model names. According to the guidelines, if a model name is extracted from the abstract, it should be presented in this array format. Since the output is indeed an array with a model name, with no other elements or format errors present, it aligns with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
