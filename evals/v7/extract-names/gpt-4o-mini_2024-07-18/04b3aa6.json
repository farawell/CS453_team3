This format aligns with the requirement specified in the description, which is to return an array of model names. There is no additional context provided that would require a return of [\"NA\"], such as a lack of model names.\n\nHowever, without the input abstract, I am unable to check if these are indeed extracted from the given abstract. The evaluation focuses solely on compliance with the format and guidelines given, independent of correctness regarding the input content.\n\nNo format violation.\nOK"
