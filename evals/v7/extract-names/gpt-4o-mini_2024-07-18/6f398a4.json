This format complies with the description given, which specifies the output should be an array of model names. Since we are not given the input abstract, we cannot determine if \"Sparse Neural Network\" is correctly extracted from it, but since correctness is not something to evaluate in this task, the output meets all requirements specified in the description based on what can be checked without the input.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
