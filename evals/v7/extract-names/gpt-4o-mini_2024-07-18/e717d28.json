This structure complies with the requirement that the response should be an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. Based on the guidelines, this output doesn't violate any compliance rules since it meets the requirement of providing model names as an array. Since we cannot check whether \"EfficientNet\" is actually a model name or not without the input, we focus only on compliance with the structure.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
