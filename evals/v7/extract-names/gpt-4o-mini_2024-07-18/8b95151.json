Since there could be multiple model names extracted, the format allows for an array of model names. However, the description specifies to return [\"NA\"] if no model names are found or if unsure. Without knowing the input, we cannot determine whether the chatbot was correct in extracting the model names \"AlphaStructure\" and \"BetaSystem\". Thus, based on the description alone, the output format is compliant with the instructions to use [\"model_name\"]. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
