Without the input abstract, I cannot verify if \"EfficientTransformer\" is a part of it, but verifying correctness is not required. Since the output is structured correctly and not [\"NA\"], it implies the chatbot found at least one model name in the input abstract, which is in line with the expected behavior.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
