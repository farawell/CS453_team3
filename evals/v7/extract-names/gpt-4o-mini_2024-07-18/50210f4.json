  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is [\"NA\"], which complies with the described task for situations where no model names are found in the abstract or uncertainty is present. As the evaluation does not require knowing the input, the decision to output [\"NA\"] is valid as we can't verify whether model names were indeed absent. Therefore, based on the given description, there is no evidence of non-compliance in the output.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
