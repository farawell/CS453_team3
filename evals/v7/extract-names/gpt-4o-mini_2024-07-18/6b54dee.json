  "complianceText": "The chatbot's task is to extract and output model names from machine learning paper abstracts. According to the description, the output should be an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. The output provided is [\"Transformer\", \"BERT\"], which is in the correct format of an array with model names. Since the evaluation does not require checking the correctness based on the abstract, I can only judge compliance by structure. The output complies with the structural requirement of being an array of strings representing model names.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
