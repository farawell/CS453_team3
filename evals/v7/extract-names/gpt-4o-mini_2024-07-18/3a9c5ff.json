If no model names are found or the chatbot is unsure, it should return [\"NA\"]. The provided output is an array containing two entries: [\"EfficientNet\", \"DeepVision\"]. Since these are formatted correctly as model names, and because checking if these are actual model names requires the input which I do not have, I assume the format is the focus here. Therefore, it seems the output complies with the required format from the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
