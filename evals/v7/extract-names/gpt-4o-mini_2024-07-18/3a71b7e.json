This format complies with the requirement of an array of model names as specified in the description. However, without knowing the input, I cannot determine if \"Recursive Neural Networks\" is actually mentioned in the abstract. Despite this, the output does not indicate uncertainty or failure to find a model name, given that it is not [\"NA\"]. Therefore, based on the compliance criteria, the output adheres to the format guidelines specified.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
