This format aligns with the description provided, as it specifies the output should be an array of model names. As I do not have the abstract, I cannot verify if \"Bayesian Networks\" is actually present in the abstract, but according to the rules, I should not check for correctness, only compliance. The format of the output complies with the guidelines, which require an array of model names.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
