According to the description, the chatbot's task is to extract model names from machine learning paper abstracts and return them in an array format like `[\"model_name\"]`. The output consists of a single model name in array format, which directly complies with the required output format as per the description. The output does not show any discrepancy in format, so it follows the guideline to return an array of model names, as expected.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
