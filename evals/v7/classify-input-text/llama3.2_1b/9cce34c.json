There are no other categories mentioned that would suggest it falls under World (news about international events), Sports (revenue or performance of athletic teams), Business (news about specific companies or their operations), or Human Interest (personal stories).",

However, the output reasoning discusses categories outside of the described categories, specifically \"Human Interest,\" which is not mentioned as a category in the description provided. The description limits the categories to \"World,\" \"Sports,\" \"Business,\" and \"Sci/Tech.\" Mentioning an additional category violates the constraint that classifications should only be from the specified categories.\n\nERR"
