  "complianceText": "The chatbot output specifies a classification of \"Business\" and provides a rationale that it's about cybersecurity breaches and their impact on industries. However, the description doesn't explicitly allow for sub-categories like cybersecurity under \"Business\", and the example given in the description does not align with these specific details. Although the reasoning might be suitable for \"Sci/Tech\" or \"Business\" based on unspecified input content, without knowing the input, the classification itself fits under \"Business\" since it hints at an industry impact. No explicit rule is violated in terms of the broad category classification. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
