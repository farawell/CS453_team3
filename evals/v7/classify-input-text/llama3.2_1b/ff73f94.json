According to the description, the chatbot is supposed to classify any given news article into one of the predefined categories: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech. The output directly contradicts this requirement by stating that it cannot classify the news article. This violates the guidelines which expect a classification to be provided regardless of the perceived sufficiency of information.\n\nERR"
