Furthermore, the input specification states that the text can include names of companies, people, specific topics, and general themes, but it is not a requirement that the input must include these elements. The input specification places no requirement that a sentence must reference companies, individuals, or any specific topics explicitly. Therefore, the input does comply with the input specification as it is a valid sentence in natural language. The absence of references to companies or individuals in the input text does not constitute a violation of the provided input specification.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
