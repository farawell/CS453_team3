  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output provides entries for company names and people names but leaves the sections for specific topics and general themes empty. According to the description, the chatbot is supposed to extract and provide lists for all four categories: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes, even if they are empty, they should retain the structure for all of them.\n\nHowever, in the output, the structure is slightly lacking because although it adheres to the format for the first two categories, the latter two do not display any indicators like \"-||-\" to signify the list structure or their emptiness. The output needs to be consistent in displaying the given structure and format for all categories outlined in the description.\n\nTherefore, the lack of structure in the latter two categories violates the explicit requirement for maintaining a structured format across all sections.\n\nERR",
