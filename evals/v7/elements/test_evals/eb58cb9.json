  "coverageEvalText": "Upon evaluating the given chatbot output, I observe the following compliance with the description:\n\n1. **Company Names**: The list for company names is present but empty. This is compliant as the rules don't state that there must be company names; only that they must be extracted if present.\n\n2. **People Names**: There are names listed under people names: Malala Yousafzai, Greta Thunberg. This follows the format required.\n\n3. **Specific Topics**: The specific topic \"impact investment\" is listed, which adheres to the expected format of specific topics being extracted.\n\n4. **General Themes**: The list is present but empty, similar to company names. Again, this matches the required output format since the description does not mandate that themes must be present, just that they should be extracted if available.\n\nAll sections are formatted as described in the chatbot description. Hence, the output complies with the required structure.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
