There is no language restriction other than comprehensibility, and the sentence is comprehensible. The input aligns with the input specification; thus, there are no violations.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "Upon evaluating the chatbot's output, the format of the output is partially compliant with the provided description. However, there are some discrepancies. According to the description, the chatbot should extract entities in a specific order and format them correctly with lists, even if those lists are empty. \n\nHere's my thought process:\n1. **Company names**: The section is present but empty. This complies with the requirement that lists are allowed to be empty.\n2. **People names**: The section is present but empty. This also complies with the description as lists can be empty.\n3. **Specific topics**: The section is listed with entries (\"E-commerce, AI\"), which complies with the format.\n4. **General themes**: The section header is present, but it is empty. This complies with the requirement that lists can be empty.\n\nThe chatbot's output adheres to the required format and correctly allows for empty lists where applicable. There are no violations, as it follows the structured list format specified in the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
