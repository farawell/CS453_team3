It is simple but coherent and correctly formed.\n\n3. **Length**: While there are no restrictions on length, the text is short but still forms a complete sentence.\n\n4. **Content**: The text includes the names of companies, \"Apple, Inc\" and \"Tesla,\" which fits the criterion of containing names of companies/people. It also subtly hints at an activity relating to these companies' exploration.\n\n5. **Language**: The input is in English, which is a comprehensible language suitable for entity extraction.\n\nThe input complies with all the stipulated conditions in the specification: it is a text string, forms a comprehensible sentence, includes company names, and is in a clear language.

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output provides extracted entities in four categories: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. According to the given description, the output should list all company names, followed by people names, specific topics, and general themes. \n\n1. The \"Company names\" field lists two entities, \"Apple\" and \"Tesla\", which appears to follow the required format as a comma-separated list. \n\n2. The \"People names\" field is empty. \n\n3. The \"Specific topics\" field is empty.\n\n4. The \"General themes\" field is empty.\n\nThe format is as expected, each category is labeled and if no entities are present, the category remains empty. The description requires extraction of each type of entity separately even if they are unknown or not provided, leading us to leave the category as empty. Given all these align with the description, the output is compliant with the format as described.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
