It contains a sentence that states \"General guidance on principles was given.\" This is a coherent statement that provides information, albeit quite general, about \"guidance\" and \"principles\". According to the input specification, the text must contain sentences of natural language, and there is no particular requirement on specificity or detailed content as long as it is comprehensible. Additionally, there are no restrictions on length, and the provided input consists of a single sentence. The sentence is in English and is comprehensible, fulfilling the condition of being understandable for accurate entity extraction. Furthermore, the input does not violate any other stated rules.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output does not fully comply with the description guidelines. The expected format specified in the description requires the output to list company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, the output only provides an entry under \"General themes\" and leaves the other categories, \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" and \"Specific topics,\" blank without indication. While it is possible that no entities exist for those categories, the description does not specify a format for handling the absence of relevant entities. The \"General themes\" is filled correctly, but the absence of explicit entries or placeholders in the other categories suggests non-compliance with the guideline of outputting entries in the specified format for each category.\n\nERR",
