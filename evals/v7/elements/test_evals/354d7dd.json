  "coverageEvalText": "In evaluating the chatbot's output according to the description, the output must contain four specific sections: \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" Each section should either list relevant items or indicate if no items were identified.\n\nHere's the reasoning for the evaluation:\n\n1. **Company Names**: The output provides an empty response for \"Company names.\" According to the guidelines, this is acceptable, as it implies that no company names were identified.\n\n2. **People Names**: The section for \"People names\" lists \"Sheryl Sandberg.\" This is consistent with the expected format, as it provides a comma-separated list (albeit with only one individual, which is allowed).\n\n3. **Specific Topics**: The section \"Specific topics\" includes \"social media trends, advertising,\" which adheres to the expected format by providing a comma-separated list.\n\n4. **General Themes**: The output for \"General themes\" is present but empty. This is compliant with the description since it suggests no overarching themes were identified.\n\nThe output meets the requirements outlined in the description for the format, with all sections present and correctly formatted. Since compliance is focused on formatting rather than content correctness, there are no violations detected in this context.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
