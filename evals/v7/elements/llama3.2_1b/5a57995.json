The name should be listed clearly without extra characters.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The phrase 'unlabelly' does not comply with the expected simple list format and may imply uncertainty or commentary rather than extraction.\n\n4. **General themes**: No issues are apparent in this category; it complies with the expected format using commas to list multiple entries.\n\nBased on the analysis, the presence of extra characters and commentary in the 'People names' and 'Specific topics' sections represents a violation of the output format rules.\n\nERR"
