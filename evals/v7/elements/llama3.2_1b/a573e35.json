However, there is a noticeable violation.\n\n1. **Format**: The output does not adhere to the specified format, which requires the use of a comma-separated list for each category. Instead, the 'Company names' section is presented as a bullet point along with unnecessary additional text in parentheses. The other sections also incorrectly use bullet points rather than a list.\n\n2. **Additional Information**: The 'Company names' section contains an explanation \"(as the text does not mention any specific company name or copyright holder),\" which is not requested or compliant with the specified format.\n\nDue to these reasons of format violation and inclusion of unrequested commentary, the output does not comply with the description given. \n\nERR"
