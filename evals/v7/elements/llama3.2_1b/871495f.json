  "complianceText": "The output appears to follow the desired format outlined in the chatbot description. The sections are clearly labeled: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. It sticks to a comma-separated list where needed. Each section is appropriately filled with related content: \"SpaceX\" for Company names, \"Elon Musk\" for People names, \"Space exploration, Future\" for Specific topics, and \"Discussions\" for General themes. \n\nHowever, the output describes \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" somewhat broadly. \"Discussions\" as a general theme is perhaps too vague, but without knowing the input text, it's challenging to confirm how well these selections fit. Therefore, the compliance evaluation should focus solely on the present structure and labeling, given the instructions not to assess correctness. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
