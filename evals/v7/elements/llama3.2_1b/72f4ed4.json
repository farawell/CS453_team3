The output format for \"Company names\" and \"People names\" does not match the desired format. The output uses \"-||-\" as the content of \"Company names,\" which indicates that no company names were extracted. However, the description suggests a comma-separated list should be present within the angle brackets, not the angle brackets themselves as content.\n\n2. The output format does not begin the list of entities with the text provided (\"Text: {{ text }}\"). This is required by the chatbot description to indicate where the extracted content came from. \n\nDue to these violations, the output does not comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
