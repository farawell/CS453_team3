  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not fully comply with the described format. According to the description, the output should separate each category (company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes) with a comma-separated list of items following a colon. Specifically:\n\n1. **Company Names**: The format does not comply; the list is denoted as \"-||-\" which is not a comma-separated list as specified in the description.\n   \n2. **People Names**: This section follows a \"-||-\" notation instead of a comma-separated list after the colon as required. It also ends with an improperly formatted separator \"||-\" which suggests an unfinished list.\n\n3. **Specific Topics**: The output begins the list correctly, but it ends with \"-||-\", which is not the expected format of ending with a comma-separated list.\n\n4. **General Themes**: This section lists themes, but should be aligned to be a comma-separated list instead of bullet points and includes an explanatory note in parentheses which is not part of the required format.\n\nGiven these observations, the format differs from what was described, primarily through the use of bullet points and incorrect separators in lists. Therefore, the output does not align with the format specified in the description.\n\nERR"
