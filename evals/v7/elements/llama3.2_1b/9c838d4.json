However, there is a compliance issue with the format for \"Company names\" and \"People names\". According to the desired format, the lists should be comma-separated, which implies actual content should be provided. The placeholders \"-||-\" indicate absence or non-existence of such entities, but is not an explicit allowance in the description provided, which expects lists of extracted entities.\n\nTherefore, the absence of content for \"Company names\" and \"People names\" and the use of placeholders \"-||-\" is a violation of the exact format prescribed in the description, as it does not match the description where a comma-separated list of names is expected.\n\nERR"
