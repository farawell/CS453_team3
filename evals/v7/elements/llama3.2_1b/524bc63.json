  "output": "Here are the extracted entities:\n\n**Company names:** JP Morgan\n\n**People names:** \n- Jane Doe\n- John Smith (note: only one person name is mentioned)\n\n**Specific topics**: Blockchain technology, Banking Systems, Financial Innovation, Cryptocurrency Development \n\n**General themes**: Fintech conference, Influences, Impact, Change",

  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot's output involves checking if it adheres to the format and guidelines specified:\n\n1. The format for extracting entities provided by the chatbot should follow the order: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. The output complies with this structure.\n\n2. The output format should use a comma-separated list for each category. The \"Company names\" entry complies with this format, using \"JP Morgan\". The \"People names\" entry, however, lists multiple names on separate lines with an additional note, which deviates from the format of a comma-separated list. This indicates a violation of the guideline, as the output should not include notes or multiple lines for names.\n\n3. The elements for \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" are listed correctly in a comma-separated format and adhere to the guidelines.\n\nDue to the deviation in how \"People names\" were presented (using separate lines and including a note), the output does not fully comply with the description provided. The specified format requires all extracted names to be in a comma-separated list without additional notes or line breaks.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it by noting that the list format for people names was not followed as specified, as well as the unnecessary note ('only one person name is mentioned') which does not comply with the description.\n\nERR"
