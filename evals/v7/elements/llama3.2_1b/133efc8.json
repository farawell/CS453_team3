  "complianceText": "The chatbot output must adhere to a specific format as provided in the description. The output should include sections for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes, each presented in the format specified. In this output:\n\n1. **Company names** section includes \"<none>\", which fits the expectation if no company names were mentioned.\n\n2. **People names** section lists two names, both separated by commas, complying with the description format.\n\n3. **Specific topics** section lists topics, separated by commas, conforming to the required format.\n\n4. **General themes** is expected to be a comma-separated list, similar to other sections. However, the current output uses a hyphen (\"-\") and a sentence. This does not comply with the description's requirement of a comma-separated list format.\n\nThe violation occurs due to the inconsistency in formatting within the \"General themes\" section when compared to the other lists. Each section should follow the same list structure as dictated by the description.\n\nTherefore, the format issue with \"General themes\" using a hyphen and sentence-like structure rather than a list is non-compliant.\n\nERR"
