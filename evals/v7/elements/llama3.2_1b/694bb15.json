According to the description, the chatbot should extract entities from the provided text and present them in a specified format, listing Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. Instead, the output states that there is no specific text to extract entities from and asks for text input. This does not meet the requirements, as it does not provide the extracted data in the desired format despite the lack of text being outside the chatbot's responsibilities as per the description given for evaluation.\n\nERR"
