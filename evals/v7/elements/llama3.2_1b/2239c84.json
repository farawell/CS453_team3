In this output, the 'People names' and 'Specific topics' fields are empty without at least an empty placeholder (such as \"People names: \" and \"Specific topics: \"). Furthermore, 'General themes:' should also include a comma-separated list. The omission of these placeholders constitutes non-compliance with the required format.\n\nERR"
