  "complianceText": "The chatbot output appears to comply with the format described in the bot's description. The entities have been extracted and listed under the correct headings: \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" The format also preserves the order of extraction specified, beginning with company names and following through to general themes. The only potential issue is whether text like \"None mentioned in the text\" fulfills the requirement of being a \"comma_separated_list_of_company_names\"; however, this does not explicitly break the pattern or format guideline due to lack of specific instruction on how to handle 'none' cases. All other sections appear to conform to the chatbot's description requirements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
