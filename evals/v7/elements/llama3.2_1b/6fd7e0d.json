  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not fully comply with the required format as described. The format specified in the description requires comma-separated lists for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, the output provided uses a list format with dashes, which does not comply with the comma-separated list format mentioned. The description also clearly specifies that the format should be in specific fields labeled \"Company names:\", \"People names:\", \"Specific topics:\", and \"General themes:\". While these labels are present, the items within the categories do not follow the required format. Therefore, based on this discrepancy, my evaluation is:\n\nThe output violates the specified format by using list formatting instead of comma-separated lists for the categories.\n\nERR"
