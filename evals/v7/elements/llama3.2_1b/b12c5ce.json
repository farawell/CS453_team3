However, upon examination, there is a format violation in the output related to the separation of the lists with commas and consistency with the format provided in the description. According to the description, the lists should be comma-separated, using a colon and spaces following the category name. Specifically:\n\n1. The \"People names\" section does not comply with the required comma-separated list format. Instead of \"-||-\", it uses a newline for a single name and includes an extra colon which deviates from the given format.\n\n2. The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections, while listing multiple topics, use hyphens instead of the specified list format which should be comma-separated values.\n\nDue to the above violations, the output format doesn't fully comply with the description provided.\n\nERR"
