  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not fully comply with the specified format. Hereâ€™s my reasoning: \n\n1. There is a formatting discrepancy in the \"People names\" section. According to the desired format, the list of people names should be a comma-separated list similar to the \"Company names\" section. However, here \"Lisa Taylor\" is listed on a new line starting with a dash, which does not adhere to the stipulated format of a comma-separated list.\n\n2. The rest of the sections (\"Company names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes\") follow the correct format, with comma-separated lists as described.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the non-compliance lies in the formatting issue in the \"People names\" section.\n\nERR"
