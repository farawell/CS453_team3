However, there are several issues regarding the compliance with the format:\n\n1. **Missing Data Placeholder**: For \"Company Names,\" the output shows a '-' which may not clearly represent that there are no companies mentioned. Ideally, it should explicitly state \"None\" to consistently align with the output for \"Specific Topics.\"\n\n2. **Unavailable Specific Topics**: It states \"None (there is no specific topic mentioned in the text)\" under specific topics, which is correct in the sense that it clarifies absence, aligning with expectations in similar scenarios of absence.\n\n3. **Output Order**: The order of entities extracted in the output is correct as per the description provided: first company names, then people names, then specific topics, and finally general themes.\n\nThe major issue is that the placeholder '-' is inconsistent with the explicit \"None\" used in another category, which could affect interpretation. \n\nERR"
