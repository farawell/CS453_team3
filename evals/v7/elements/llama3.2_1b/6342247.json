Specifically, the section for \"Company names\" uses a different format ('-||-'), which is not consistent with how other sections like \"People names\" and \"General themes\" are formatted (using `||` as separators). Additionally, the \"Specific topics\" section is missing any extracted topics despite having an explanatory note below indicating a specific topic, which seems contradictory. Furthermore, the formatting issues with brackets and inconsistent use of separators in the \"General themes\" section detract from the compliant output, indicating errors in maintaining the required structure and format consistency.\n\nERR"
