  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot output is based on the description that the chatbot must follow. The given output is evaluated for compliance with the prescribed format.\n\n1. **Format Structure**: The format required is:\n   - Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n   - People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\n   - Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\n   - General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n\n2. **Output Review**:\n   - The segment for \"Company names\" contains '-||-', which signifies no company names listed. This section complies because it is appropriately marked as empty.\n   - The segment for \"People names\" contains 'Malala Yousafzai, Greta Thunberg', which is correctly formatted as a comma-separated list.\n   - The segment for \"Specific topics\" includes 'Impact investments,' followed by '-||-', indicating that there is one specific topic mentioned and then signifies closure of this section. This complies with the description.\n   - The segment for \"General themes\" includes '-||-, Sustainability, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)'. The '-||-' appears in this segment which signifies no company names, but it does not follow the required format for themes as it does not appear at the start of this section. The start should mention a valid list or closure without an empty indicator in between. \n\n3. **Violation & Reasoning**: \n   - The inconsistency arises in the \"General themes\" section due to the '-||-' usage between the valid topics. Every section should strictly adhere to a clear listing or closure, and the position of '-||-' indicates there are no company names but here it is incorrectly placed in themes.\n\nTherefore, the output does not adhere to the specified format strictly in the General themes section.\n\nERR"
