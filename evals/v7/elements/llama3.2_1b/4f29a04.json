  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output format is mostly correct, however, a discrepancy exists in the \"General Themes\" section. The description specifies using a comma-separated list for each category, yet the chatbot output does not adhere to this format for the \"General Themes,\" presenting it as a bullet point instead. This constitutes a violation as it does not comply with the desired format. Moreover, \"General Themes\" should have potentially been more than just \"Data Privacy,\" but that cannot be confirmed without the original text. \n\nThe decision is based on the format inconsistency for \"General Themes\" as per the guidelines.\n\nERR"
