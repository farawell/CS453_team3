  "complianceText": "The output does not strictly comply with the format provided in the description. There are several issues:\n\n1. The section \"Company names\" contains the phrase \"None mentioned in this text,\" which deviates from the required format of a comma-separated list.\n\n2. For \"People names\" and \"General themes,\" the output uses \"-||-\" to indicate absence, which is consistent with the description.\n\n3. The \"Specific topics\" are listed appropriately as bullet points, which fits within the allowed variance as long as they are comprehensible.\n\n4. The \"General themes\" section partly follows the format by including a bullet point, but the presence of a paragraph-like sentence makes it deviate from the expected simple listing style.\n\nBased on these observations, the output does not fully comply with the format stipulated in the description.\n\nERR"
