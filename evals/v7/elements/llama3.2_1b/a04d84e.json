  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides the information in the expected order: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, there is a non-compliance issue with the format for \"People names\". The chatbot's guideline specifies that the entities should be in a list format, delineated by commas. The \"People names\" field correctly uses the placeholder \"-||-\" to indicate no entities were identified, but it erroneously appends a hyphen after \"Mark Zuckerberg\" which suggests incomplete compliance with the expected list format structure, causing inconsistency. In addition, the \"Company names\" field should also include such a placeholder, but ends with \"-||-\", which is incorrect. Therefore, the output does not fully comply with the described format.\n\nERR"
