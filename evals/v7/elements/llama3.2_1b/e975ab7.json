  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot output is as follows:\n\n1. **Company names**: The format \"Company names: Tesla\" is compliant with the required format, which specifies a comma-separated list of company names.\n\n2. **People names**: The format specifies \"People names: -||-\". The output provides \"People names: None (this is a brand-only name, no specific person associated with the company)\", which implies that no people names were found. While the format is slightly different from the exact placeholder given (-||-), it does express the absence of people names. This does not constitute sufficient deviation from the expected format to warrant a violation, especially considering that no specific person is associated. The focus is more on compliance of format, and providing extra context is not strictly a format violation if it does not create ambiguity.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The format \"Specific topics: Technology, Electric vehicles\" is compliant with the required format that specifies a comma-separated list.\n\n4. **General themes**: The format \"General themes: Innovation, Auto industry, Business announcements\" complies with the format requirement of a comma-separated list.\n\nTherefore, considering the focus on format compliance and ignoring correctness due to lack of input, the output by the chatbot adheres to the prescribed guidelines.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
