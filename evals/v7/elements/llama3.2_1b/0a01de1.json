  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot output can be performed according to the outlined description. The desired format specifies the entity categories: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. Each should be presented as a comma-separated list.\n\n1. **Company names**: The output provides \"None\", which is acceptable if no company names were mentioned in the text. Without knowing the input, it's impossible to verify its correctness, but the compliance format-wise is met.\n\n2. **People names**: The output lists \"Jane Jacobs\". However, the description specifies that each category should be a comma-separated list. The presence of \"Jane Jacobs\" with a preceding bullet point (implying a list) suggests a formatting issue. Instead, a comma-separated list was expected.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: These are presented as \"Smart City Planning, Architecture,\" which correctly follows a comma-separated format.\n\n4. **General themes**: These are listed as \"Urban Development, Community Development,\" which also correctly follows the format required.\n\nGiven these observations, the error lies in the formatting under \"People names,\" where a list format with bullet points was used instead of a comma-separated list, as the description unambiguously specifies.\n\nThere is non-compliance with the specific requirement for the output format of the \"People names\" category due to its deviation from a comma-separated list format.\n\nERR"
