  "complianceText": "The chatbot output has several non-compliance issues related to the formatting described in the guidelines. The output included 'CEO' and 'Jack Dorsey' as specific topics, but according to the format, personal names should be categorized under \"People names,\" and they shouldn't appear in the \"Specific topics\" section. Additionally, the word \"poliy\" appears to be a typographical error; they likely meant \"policy changes.\" This error may not be directly related to the compliance with the format, but it indicates inattention to detail. Hence, the output is not directly following the dictated format because the people names section is marked as empty while a person is actually mentioned in the specific topics.\n\nERR"
