  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description because:\n\n1. In the section for \"Company names,\" the output shows an unconventional \"-||-\" symbol instead of a comma-separated list or indicating explicitly as empty.\n2. The \"Specific topics\" section includes \"Alexander Hamilton (historical figure)\" which seems redundant since Alexander Hamilton is already listed under \"People names.\" This may suggest repetition instead of distinctly different entities.\n3. The format does not exactly match the required formatting with angle brackets <>, as it uses bold text with colons and lists with hyphens instead.\n\nWith these points in mind, the output fails to adhere to the specified format and separation of entities outlined in the description.\n\nERR"
