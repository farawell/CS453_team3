  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description. The output is a request for input text and a description of the process it will follow upon receiving the text. However, the description provided requires a structured format output containing extracted company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes directly from a given text. Instead of providing this formatted extraction, the chatbot is simply explaining what it would do if it were to receive input, which does not satisfy the requirement to output the extracted entities in the specified format.\n\nExplanation: The description specifies that the chatbot should provide a structured output listing Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes based on a given text. The chatbot output lacks any extraction results and does not provide any structured output that matches the required format. Instead, it requests text and outlines a process, which does not meet the requirement of directly displaying extracted information.\n\nERR"
