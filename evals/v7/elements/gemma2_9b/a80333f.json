  "complianceText": "The chatbot output prompts the user to provide the text for analysis, stating its intended actions once the text is given. The evaluation is based on the guidelines provided in the description and does not require the input text to be available to assess compliance.\n\n1. **Output Format Compliance**: The desired format specified in the guidelines requires:\n   - Company names listed in a comma-separated format.\n   - People names also listed in a comma-separated format.\n   - Specific topics and general themes to be listed clearly.\n\n2. **Evaluation**: The given output does not provide any extracted entities or themes. Instead, it explains the process once the text is provided. There is no attempt at extracting or listing the entities without the text.\n\n3. **Reasoning**: The rules require the entities and themes to be extracted and listed in a specific format. However, the chatbot output is not attempting to perform the extraction on its own. Instead, it provides instructions to the user, which deviates from the expected result of listing extracted entities based on a provided input.\n\nSince the output does not attempt to comply with the format or requirements outlined in the description, it constitutes non-compliance.\n\nExplaining the violation is straightforward: The output is missing the required structure of listing extracted entities as no text was processed, which is non-compliant with the expected outcome. The description requires the chatbot to provide extracted entities in a specific format, which wasn't executed here.\n\nERR"
