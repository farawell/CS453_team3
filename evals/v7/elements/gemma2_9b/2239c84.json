The output format matches the desired format given in the description, with each category title followed by a colon and a list of items. The company names \"Amazon, Airbnb\" are separated by a comma as required. The other categories are also properly formatted. There are no people names mentioned, which is technically allowed as there might not have been any people mentioned in the input text. The compliance of this aspect cannot be evaluated without the input, so no violation is noted there. Overall, the output complies with the stated format rules.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
