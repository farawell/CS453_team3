The description specifies that the output should be in the format of listing company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes extracted from the text provided. However, the output from the chatbot is requesting text input for analysis rather than providing a formatted extraction of entities from a given text.\n\nThe output is not following the desired format and does not include any extracted entities, as it seems to indicate an inability to perform the task without more information from the user. This specifically violates the guideline that states the chatbot should output the extracted information in a specified format, which would consist of the extracted company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes.\n\nERR"
