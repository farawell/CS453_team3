The description clearly expects the output to be in a specific format with extracted company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes based on a given text. However, the chatbot output instead requests the input text for analysis and does not provide any extractions as the description specifies. Thus, the output deviates from the expectation, which is to receive already extracted entities and themes in the requested format.\n\nERR"
