According to the desired format outlined in the description, each category requires a colon followed by a comma-separated list and ending in \"-||-\". The output for \"Company names\" is \"-||-\", which is correct if no company names are mentioned. However, \"People names\" is given as \"Neil Gaiman ||-\" instead of \"Neil Gaiman -||-\", causing a format issue since it lacks the leading hyphen. \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" are also separated by spaces and commas without following the correct ending format of \"-||-\": they instead use \"::-\" and \"-publishing,\", resulting in a format error.\n\nERR"
