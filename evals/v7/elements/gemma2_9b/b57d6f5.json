According to the description, each section should contain a comma-separated list of mentions as extracted from the given text. Here are my assessments:\n\n1. **Company names**: This section is present but empty. Without knowing the input, I cannot judge whether this is correct, but the format is adhered to.\n\n2. **People names**: This section is present but also empty. Again, I cannot verify the correctness, but format-wise it meets the requirement.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: This section contains two specific topics, \"technological advancements\" and \"societal impacts\". It complies with the required format.\n\n4. **General themes**: This section contains one general theme, \"impact of technology on society\", which follows the format specified in the description.\n\nThe structure adheres to the required output format, presenting each set of names, topics, and themes according to the guidelines. There is no additional or missing information within the outlined criteria, and all categories are addressed even if some remain empty, which is acceptable due to lack of input.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
