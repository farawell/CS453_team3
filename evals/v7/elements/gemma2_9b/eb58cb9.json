However, the Company names section is empty, which could indicate a lack of compliance unless the input text did not contain any company names. Since we cannot check for presence or absence of company names without the input text, we must focus on the format. The format is correctly adhered to as each category is presented, and even though the company names section is empty, it is still listed. Thus, the output complies with the description in terms of format requirements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
