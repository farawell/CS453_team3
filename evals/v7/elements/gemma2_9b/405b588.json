However, the format is not precisely adhered to because the categories were not presented on the same line as the list or no list was given for those entities mentioned as \"None\" or \"no company names.\" The output does not explicitly present categories with a list format separated by a colon. Instead, it contains narratives/descriptions mixed in with bullet points, not adhering strictly to the format. \n\nErring on the side of strict adherence to the format, this signifies a non-compliance. \n\nERR"
