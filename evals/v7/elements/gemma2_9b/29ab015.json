  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is mostly compliant with the desired format provided in the description. However, there is a slight discrepancy in the format specified in the description and what the chatbot provided:\n\n1. The description provided specifies that the extracted categories should be presented in a format like this: \n   - \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\"\n   - \"People names: -||-\"\n   - \"Specific topics: -||-\"\n   - \"General themes: -||-\"\n\n   In the chatbot output, the format deviates by using asterisks and newlines, while the description requests a comma-separated list directly following the category name.\n\n2. Company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes are all listed on separate lines, separated by newlines rather than commas followed directly after the category name.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the format slightly deviates from the requested output. The extracted entities are presented in a bullet point format rather than as comma-separated lists immediately following the category label.\n\nThus, the output does not meet the exact format requirements laid out in the description. \n\nERR"
