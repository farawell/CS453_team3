The description specifies that the chatbot should extract and present entities and themes from a given text in a specific format. However, the output does not perform this task; instead, it asks for input text and describes what it will do once the text is provided. There is no actual extraction or a list of company names, people names, specific topics, or general themes given in the required format. Therefore, the chatbot output does not meet the description's requirements.\n\nERR"
