While the presence of content cannot be judged, it does not comply with the description's prescribed format exactly. Specific topics should be a comma-separated list, and general themes should be similarly formatted and do not exactly follow the required period punctuation.\n\nTherefore, the output does not precisely adhere to the prescribed response format specified in the description.\n\nERR"
