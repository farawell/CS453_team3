The section under \"Company names:\" is blank, but it should explicitly have \"-||-\" if no company names are mentioned to fully adhere to the desired format. The formatting guideline indicates that each section should either contain a comma-separated list of relevant entities or \"-||-\" explicitly, which the output correctly did for \"People names.\" Leaving the \"Company names\" list as blank does not fully comply with the requirement of the description, which expects either a list or \"-||-\" in each category.\n\nThis absence in formatting for the \"Company names\" is the basis for the non-compliance with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
