This indicates a potential compliance issue, as there should be an indication of whether there are company names present or not (for instance, \"None\" if applicable). Without more information, I have to consider this non-compliance with the description, which requires all categories to be filled appropriately.\n\nContractually, if any category is consistently left blank without a clear indication that there are no relevant entities to fill it, it challenges the output's compliance.\n\nERR"
