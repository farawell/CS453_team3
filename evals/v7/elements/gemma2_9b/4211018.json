Let's evaluate each part:\n\n1. **Company names:** The output lists \"Amazon, IBM, Google\", which adheres to the format requirements â€“ a comma-separated list of company names.\n   \n2. **People names:** This section is present but empty, which follows the required format (although content correctness cannot be verified without input).\n   \n3. **Specific topics:** \"Technology companies\" is listed as a specific topic, and it appears in the dedicated section in the required format.\n   \n4. **General themes:** The general themes \"Industry giants\" and \"Competition in technology\" are separated but fit within the category. The format \"General themes:\" is correctly followed.\n\nThe output complies with the required format: each category is clearly stated, and terms are appropriately separated by commas where lists apply. Only the required parts of the template are adjusted according to the given data, and no speculative or inferred information is added to the output. Additionally, there is no violation of any structural formatting.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
