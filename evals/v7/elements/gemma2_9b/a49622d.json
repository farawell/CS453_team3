  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the specified format in the description for several reasons:\n\n1. The category \"Company names\" and \"Specific topics\" are empty, but they should still be included in the listed format with their proper headings even if they contain no entries. The chatbot has listed \"Specific topics\" with items, but \"Company names\" is left entirely blank without a comma-separated placeholder or empty entry, as the format implies it should.\n\n2. The output uses parentheses to explain implications for the \"Specific topics\" that are not part of the required output format. The description does not call for explanatory parentheses or any additional information beyond listing entities.\n\n3. The output specs mention a list output in a comma-separated format for each category; however, the chatbot has used bullet points instead of a comma-separated list format for the specific topics and general themes.\n\n4. Each category should be on a separate line clearly, and although generally adhering to this, the presentation with bullet points deviates from the specified format.\n\nBased on these points, the chatbot output violates the format guidelines in the description.\n\nERR"
