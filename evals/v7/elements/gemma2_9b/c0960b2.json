  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description for the following reason:\n\n- The \"Company names\" section is empty. Since the description requires extracting all company names, this section should at least contain some entries (assuming there should be companies mentioned in the text). However, determining whether this is the case requires knowing the input. Therefore, we cannot ascertain non-compliance for this issue without the input text.\n\n- The format for other sections appears to be consistent with the output criteria and order specified in the description.\n\nSince the presence of an empty \"Company names\" section may or may not signify non-compliance without knowing the input text, I must conclude there is not enough evidence of non-compliance given the instructions.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
