  "complianceText": "The chatbot output shows that it attempted to list \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\". \n\n- For \"Company names\" and \"People names\", the output includes the placeholder \"-||-\", as expected if there are no entities of those kinds mentioned in the text. However, \"Company names\" is completely left empty which might suggest no companies were mentioned, but it is inconsistent with the format used for \"People names\".\n  \n- The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections are populated with phrases. These conform to the expected format of comma-separated lists, though it is a little unclear without input if these were extracted correctly. Format-wise, they do follow the guidelines.\n\nConsidering the above:\n- The inconsistency in handling the \"Company names\" and \"People names\" is a deviation from the desired format, where even if there are no entities, the placeholder \"-||-\" should be consistently used. \n\nERR"
