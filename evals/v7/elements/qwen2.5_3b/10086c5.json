The \"People names\" section lists \"Ada Lovelace, Marie Curie,\" following the described format. The \"General themes\" section contains a comma-separated list, as expected.\n\nHowever, the \"Specific topics\" section contains \"no_rule,\" which does not follow the format outlined. The required format is a comma-separated list of specific topics, not \"no_rule.\" This constitutes a violation of the format rules specified in the description.\n\nTherefore, the output contains a violation due to non-compliance with the required format for \"Specific topics,\" despite the potential correctness of the content with respect to the input. \n\nERR"
