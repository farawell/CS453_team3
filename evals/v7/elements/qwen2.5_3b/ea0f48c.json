  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description provided. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. **Company names**: The output lists \"Apple,\" which is in the correct format.\n2. **People names**: \"-||-\" is used appropriately to indicate that no people names are extracted.\n3. **Specific topics**: The list includes several specific topics. This is formatted correctly.\n4. **General themes**: However, the section for \"General themes\" uses \"-||-\" to indicate no general themes were extracted, which contradicts the instruction to extract general overarching themes. The prompt expects a list, even if general themes need to be inferred from specific topics provided.\n\nBecause the \"General themes\" section is not filled as expected, this violates the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
