  "complianceText": "The chatbot output has some issues in compliance with the structured format described. \n\n1. According to the given format, 'People names' should be a comma-separated list. Here, 'People names' is represented as '-||-', which does not conform to any standard or described format for the list.\n\n2. Additionally, the 'General themes' category includes the specific topic 'Royal Family History', which suggests a lack of distinction between specific topics and general overarching themes. This makes the output appear to repeat information rather than categorize it distinctly, but this might need input information to judge fully and is ignored.\n\nThis leads to the decision that the format is not strictly adhered to. Therefore, the output does not comply fully with the description provided.\n\nERR"
