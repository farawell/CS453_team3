The output provided includes categories listed in the described order: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. Each category is clearly labeled, followed by a colon and a list of appropriate items.\n\n1. The order of categories in the output matches the order specified in the description. \n2. Each category is separated by a line break, which helps in visual distinction even though the description doesn't explicitly specify this formatting detail.\n3. The desired format with comma-separated lists has been followed (since there's only one item in some of these lists, this is acceptable, and the compliance focuses on structure).\n4. No information that requires knowing the input (such as correctness of extracted entities) is needed to evaluate compliance.\n\nGiven that the format and order are in compliance with the description, there are no detected violations.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
