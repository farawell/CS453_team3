In the provided description, each category (Company names, People names, Specific topics, General themes) should have a comma-separated list of entities, even if they are empty. However, the chatbot output adheres to the format \"Company names: \" without any entries and \"-||-\" for \"People names\", but it deviates from the format in the \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections. Instead of an empty list, it includes explanatory text indicating no entities or themes, which does not match the format requirement of specifying a list.\n\nSince the output for \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" is not in the prescribed format, it is non-compliant with the description.\n\nERR"
