It lists the company names under \"Company names\" with a comma-separated list, and it explicitly uses \"-||-\" for \"People names,\" indicating no entries, which is consistent with the format. Similarly, the \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections also follow the same format, with entries separated by commas. There are no violations regarding the output format. The specific entries under each category cannot be assessed for correctness as the input text is not provided. Therefore, the focus is solely on compliance with the format, which is correctly followed here.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
