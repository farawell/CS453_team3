The lists are delimited using '-||-' for the latter three categories, just as indicated.\n\n1. **Company names**: The output states \"<none>\". This is compliant with the format, as the description does not specify how to handle cases with no entities besides requiring a comma-separated list, and \"<none>\" can be interpreted as a placeholder for the lack of company names.\n\n2. **People names**: The output includes \"Yuval Noah Harari\" preceded by '-||-', which complies with the required format.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: This section provides a list of topics: \"technological evolution, ethical challenges, AI, society,\" preceded by '-||-', which aligns with the required format.\n\n4. **General themes**: Contains \"exploration, understanding, future implications,\" also preceded by '-||-', in line with the required format.\n\nGiven the structure adheres to the specified format using '-||-' as required for people names, specific topics, and general themes, and provides an indication for the absence of company names, the output complies with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
