  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot's output based on the provided description involves checking whether the format adheres to the specified structure and sequence. \n\n1. The output structure is correct as it lists categories namely, Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes, each on a separate line following the prescribed order of company names first, then people names, specific topics, and finally general themes.\n\n2. For the Company names section, it includes '<no_company_names>', which seems to indicate that there are no company names present. Although not explicitly specified in the chatbot description, using such a placeholder could be a reasonable approach if no relevant entity exists.\n\n3. The People names, Specific topics, and General themes sections list their respective entities in a comma-separated format, adhering to the requested format.\n\nOverall, the output complies with the format described in the chatbot's instructions, addressing each required section in order and using a clear separation of different entity types. Therefore, there are no violations of the format requirement.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
