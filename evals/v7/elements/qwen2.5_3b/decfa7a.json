The format should include four sections: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes, each followed by a comma-separated list of items. In evaluating the compliance:\n\n1. **Company Names**: This section is present, but it is empty, indicating no company names were extracted. Without knowing the input, it's unclear if this is valid.\n\n2. **People Names**: The format is correct with one name listed, \"Dr. Jane Goodalls\". The name should be listed exactly as found in the text, though we can't verify this without input.\n\n3. **Specific Topics**: The section lists \"biodiversity, habitat preservation\". This matches the format expectations.\n\n4. **General Themes**: This section lists \"conservation, endangered species, environmental forum\". This also adheres to the expected format.\n\nAll sections are included in the output and follow the format laid out in the description, with comma-separated lists. There are no structural violations based on the parts of the description that do not require input knowledge.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
