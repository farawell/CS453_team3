Each section is populated with a comma-separated list, even if there is only one item in the section (e.g., \"Walmart\" and \"Suresh Kumar\"), which still adheres to the format as nothing requires more than one entry in each section for compliance. It does not require knowledge of the text input to ascertain correctness, only to verify compliance with formatting.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
