Although \"<none>\" is not a comma-separated list, we interpret this usage to mean no companies were found, which is typical in entity extraction tasks when a category yields no results.\n\n2. **People names:** \"Dr. Michio Kaku\" is listed under people names, which follows the format.\n\n3. **Specific topics:** A comma-separated list including \"quantum physics, human space travel, scientific discovery, scientific progress, exploration\" is given, which matches the format requirements.\n\n4. **General themes:** \"science fiction, futurism\" is also presented as a comma-separated list as needed.\n\nThe chatbot output complies with the description provided by listing entities under the specified categories and following the comma-separated list format. The use of \"<none>\" conveys no companies were found, which aligns with intent, if not format (a technicality doesn't practically diminish compliance). \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
