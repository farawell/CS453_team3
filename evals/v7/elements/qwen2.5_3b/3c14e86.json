  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the output is as follows:\n\n1. **Company names**: The format requirement is a comma-separated list. The output shows \"<no_comma_separated_company_names>\" which does not match the required format. It should either list no companies with an empty field or indicate \"None\" or similar without inconsistency or placeholder text.\n\n2. **People names**: The output is \"<-||->\", which matches the provided description's indication for an empty or non-applicable list.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The output lists \"Non-secured mentionings, Purpose breakdown\". This complies with the format as it is comma-separated.\n\n4. **General themes**: The output lists \"Abstract concepts, Simplification, Clarity\". This also follows the correct format as it is comma-separated.\n\nThe violation is with the \"Company names\" field where the format \"<no_comma_separated_company_names>\" does not comply with the description's formatting requirements.\n\nERR"
