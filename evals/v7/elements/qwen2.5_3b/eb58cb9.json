  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot's output must focus on whether the output complies with the description provided. According to the description, each category (Company names, People names, Specific topics, General themes) should use a specific format with comma-separated lists. There are a few issues with compliance in the given output:\n\n1. **Format Issue**:\n   - The `People names` category is not in the correct format. It should be `<comma_separated_list_of_people_names>`. The provided output uses hyphens ('-||-') around the names instead of angle brackets ([]), which is not in compliance with the format rules.\n   - Similarly, for `Specific topics` and `General themes`, the hyphens ('-||-') are not in accordance with the format described.\n\n2. **Company Names Placeholder**:\n   - The placeholder `<no_company_in_text>` used for `Company names` does not conform to the specified formatting requirements. It should be `<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>` even if empty.\n\n3. **Additional Text**:\n   - Additional explanatory text \"Note that in the given text...\" is not part of the specified output format and can be considered non-compliant though checking for additional text allegations requires knowing the input.\n\nDue to the issues with the format and placeholders, the output does not comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
