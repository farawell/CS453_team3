  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output needs to comply with the description provided. Based on the desired format specified in the description, the output must list company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes.\n\n1. **Company names**: The format requires a comma-separated list of company names, but the output only states \"Company names:\" with no actual names listed. While it might be that no company names were present in the input, evaluating that requires knowledge of the input, which we do not have. There are no violations based solely on compliance.\n\n2. **People names**: The format requires a comma-separated list of people names, and the output correctly uses '-||-' which indicates compliance as it was requested to use the same symbol in case of zero names.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The output lists \"prolonged absence, themes\". The inclusion of \"themes\" in specific topics seems incorrect since \"themes\" is most likely an overarching category. Stating it as a specific topic indicates a formatting error as it contradicts with general themes.\n\n4. **General themes**: The output mentions \"loss, absence\", which is correctly formatted. However, the mention of \"themes\" under the specific topics likely indicates a misunderstanding of the category delineation, causing a formatting inconsistency.\n\nOverall, the output fails to clearly differentiate between what constitutes a specific topic versus an overarching theme, leading to a formatting issue in specific topics, which seems to have incorrectly included \"themes\".\n\nViolation:\n- The term \"themes\" appears in the specific topics, which is likely inappropriate based on its general nature and indicative of overarching general themes hence indicating a misunderstanding of the categories.\n\nErr.\nERR"
