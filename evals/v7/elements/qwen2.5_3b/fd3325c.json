According to the description, the chatbot should output a comma-separated list of company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. In this case, the format is correct, but the value for \"Company names\" is missing after the colon. Additionally, both the “People names” and \"Company names\" should still maintain the placeholder \"-||-\" if there are no names to list. However, \"Company names\" is improperly left as an empty field instead of \"-||-\". The \"People names\" section correctly uses the placeholder \"-||-\", but the inconsistency in handling empty fields is a violation of the expected format.\n\nMissing some necessary placeholder, due to which the output does not follow adhere to the described format.\nERR"
