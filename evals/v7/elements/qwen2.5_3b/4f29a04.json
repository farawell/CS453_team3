  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides different categories for extracted entities and themes, as required: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. However, it uses \"<empty>\" for company names instead of following the expected format, which should be a comma-separated list, despite there being no company names to list. The \"<empty>\" annotation is not specified in the expected format. Additionally, for People names, while the format \"-||-\" is expected, it should explicitly mention this list is empty or provide that section. However, the specific and general themes seem to comply with the required format.\n\nTherefore, my thinking is that there is a violation concerning the way empty lists should be presented, specifically in the \"Company names\" section.\n\nERR"
