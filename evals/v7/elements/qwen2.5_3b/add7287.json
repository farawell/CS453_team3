  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is not fully compliant with the description provided. The issue lies in the format of the \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections. Instead of using \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" or \"-||-\", the output used \"<empty>\". This is a deviation from the specified format.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Company Names**: The format specifies \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" or \"-||-\", but \"<empty>\" was used instead. This is a format violation.\n   \n2. **People Names**: The \"<empty>\" placeholder was not used here, but \"-||-\" as per format specification.\n\nSince there's a format violation in the \"Company Names\" section, the compliant designation cannot be given.\n\nERR"
