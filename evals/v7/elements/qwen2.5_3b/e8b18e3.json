Each category is clearly defined and separated, following the provided order: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. The structure and labeling match the required format, and there are no additional or missing categories. Although \"People names\" utilizes the placeholder \"-||-\", indicating no people names were extracted, this is in accordance with the format requirements. There are no visible violations in terms of format or organization of categories. Given that the correctness of the content in each category cannot be ascertained without the original input, I cannot evaluate the functional correctness but based on the structure provided, it complies with the guidelines.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
