  "complianceText": "The output does not fully comply with the description. The issue here is with the \"Company names\" field, which is left empty. According to the format specified in the description, this list should either be a comma-separated list of company names or an indication that there are no company names explicitly by stating \"none\" or a similar term, rather than leaving it empty. This omission can lead to ambiguity in the interpretation of the output. Moreover, an incorrect separator (\"/\") is used in the \"General themes\" section.\n\nGiven these discrepancies, the output is not completely aligning with the required description format. Therefore, my conclusion is:\n\nThe missing indicator for \"Company names\" and the incorrect separator in \"General themes\" are violations.\nERR"
