According to the format in the description, these should be populated with relevant names or otherwise correctly acknowledge the lack of such entities in a manner that is explicitly understood as compliant (e.g., stating 'None' if applicable). Simply leaving the Company names section blank could lead to ambiguity in compliance. Additionally, the fields for topics and themes appear to use descriptive phrases rather than simply enumerating clear themes, which could also be considered a deviation from precise format adherence depending on interpretation.\n\nERR"
