The output format has included sections for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes, which aligns with the format specified in the description. However, the section for \"Company names\" is left empty without any indication of whether there are none or if this is an oversight, which does not comply with the requirement to provide a comma-separated list.\n\nThere is a structural issue in the presentation of the \"Company names\" extraction, which does not align with the explicitly required format to mention none if there are no companies to list. \n\nERR"
