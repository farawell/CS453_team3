  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description in several ways. First, the 'Company names' section should not be empty if there are no companies mentioned; it should explicitly indicate so, as demonstrated by the format for other lists (\"-||-\"). Second, there seems to be inconsistency in the format when indicating no entities. The output uses \"-||-\" only for 'People names' but does not consistently apply it to 'Company names', which could suggest an incompleteness in the output. Finally, while I can't verify the correctness of content extraction without knowing the input, the inconsistent application of \"-||-\" for listing the absence of entities signals a deviation from the required format.\n\nERR"
