As there is a separation with a colon, it follows the format described, although the format suggests a list, which should be comma-separated if there are multiple entries. Given there's only one entry, this format is acceptable.\n\n2. The people name \"Lisa Taylor\" is appropriately listed under \"People names\", following the expected format.\n\n3. The specific topics such as \"cybersecurity\", \"online threats\", \"digital security\", and \"data protection\" are listed under \"Specific topics\", aligning with the format guidelines.\n\n4. The general themes, namely \"cybersecurity trends\" and \"data safety\", are listed under \"General themes\" correctly.\n\nEach section is separated as instructed, and each indication such as \"Company names:\", \"People names:\", \"Specific topics:\", and \"General themes:\" is present, as per the required format.\n\nNo violations of the expected output format have been detected.\n\nOK"
