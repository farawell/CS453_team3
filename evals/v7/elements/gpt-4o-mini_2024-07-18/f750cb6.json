Firstly, the company names are not properly formatted as a comma-separated list, given that \"Apple, Inc\" should ideally be written without a comma or as \"Apple Inc.\" Furthermore, the output lacks the expected line format provided in the description for People names, Specific topics, and General themes; they are supposed to contain a list, even if empty, rather than repeating the placeholder text \"-||-\". This does not adhere to the guidelines specified in the format.\n\nERR"
