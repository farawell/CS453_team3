As it stands, this part of the output does not comply with the required format.\n2. \"People names: -||-\" correctly uses the placeholder to indicate no names were found, so it complies with the description.\n3. \"Specific topics: technological advancements, societal impacts\" lists specific topics correctly in the comma-separated format.\n4. \"General themes: technology, society, progress\" also lists general themes correctly in the comma-separated format.\n\nThe violation is with the \"Company names:\" section.
