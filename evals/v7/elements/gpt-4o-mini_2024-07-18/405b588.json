However, the section for 'Company names' is empty, which may not be an issue by itself since we do not know the input. On the other hand, it correctly provides content under 'Specific topics' and 'General themes'. There is no direct indication that the format or the ordering of sections is incorrect. Therefore, based on the provided output alone, it complies with the described requirements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
