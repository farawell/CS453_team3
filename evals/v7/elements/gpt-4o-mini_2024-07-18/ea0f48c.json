The other sections include multiple items, which also fit the intended format since the presence of the \"-||-\" separator wasn't explicitly required because it was shown only in the Desired format and not described.\n\nSince all required sections are present, and the output adheres to the described format, it complies with the chatbot description. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
