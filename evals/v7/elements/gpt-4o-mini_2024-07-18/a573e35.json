The provided format should include company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. \n\nIn the chatbot's output, the format begins with \"Company names: \" followed by the list of entities, which in this case, is empty. This follows with \"People names: \" which lists Florence Nightingale and Clara Barton, followed by \"Specific topics: \" with healthcare and nursing, and ends with \"General themes: \" listing influence and historical contributions to healthcare.\n\nThere is a possible issue of non-compliance with the chatbot description: \"Company names\" section should have at least the string \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\", even if there are no company names mentioned in the text. In the output, this string is missing and leads to a non-compliance with the provided description.\n\nERR"
