  "complianceText": "The output of the chatbot adheres to the format specified in the description by listing entities in the prescribed categories: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, there is an issue with the \"People names\" category. The chatbot output uses \"-||-\" as a placeholder which is compliant with the expected pattern when there are no entities to list. The other categories follow the required format as well. My judgment does not require knowledge about the input text, so I can only check that the format is correct and not the accuracy or content of the entities extracted. Based on the given guidelines, since there is no explicit deviation from the format, the output is compliant.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
