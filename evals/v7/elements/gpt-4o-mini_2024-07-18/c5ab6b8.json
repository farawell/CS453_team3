  "complianceText": "Upon evaluating the output, the format does not strictly follow the guidelines provided in the description:\n\nIn the description, it mentions that each category should be followed by a comma-separated list if there are multiple entities, but the formats such as \"Company names: PepsiCo\" and \"People names: Maria Cortez\" do not follow this comma-separated format if more entries were to be included. While it is technically correct with only one entry, this format is slightly ambiguous if multiple entries were to be added.\n\nHowever, the primary issue is the violation of sectioning. The description explicitly stated that two consecutive text categories (\"Company names\" and \"People names\") should be separated by a comma when listed, as done with \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\". This inconsistency and lack of format uniformity with \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" in multi-entity cases suggest a deviation from the prescribed, consistent structure.\n\nTherefore, the format inconsistency and ambiguity in the case of having multiple entries in \"Company names\" or \"People names\" without specifying the list requirements — comma-separated elements — is a point of non-compliance.\n\nERR"
