As the input text is not provided, we cannot evaluate the correctness or completeness of the extracted entitiesâ€”only the compliance with the specified format.\n\nGiven the task is to evaluate compliance with the description and not correctness based on input, there seems to be no violation of the format guidelines specified.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
