  "coverageText": "(Enter LORD TREVOR, his countenance wrought with turmoil, as he laments the cruel sting of betrayal under the pale moonlight.)\n\nLORD TREVOR:\nO heart, cloven asunder by most malignant treachery!\nHow dost selfsame confidant strike with serpent's fang,\nTo unmake bonds crafted by trust's gentle hand?\nFair weather deceiver, who wore the visage of friend,\nHast thou no soul, to delight in traitorous deed?\nThee, who in life's banquet didst share my own platter,\nNow stands above me, holding dagger glist'ning with treason.\n\nMethought our path was one coal-lit road,\nWhere honour's steadfast flame did brightly blaze,\nYet lo! What is this shadow that doth betray?\n'Tis thine own, vile phantom, lurking beneath mask'd guise.\nWoe unto mine eyes, which couldst not see,\nThe poison'd whispers thy words concealed from me.\nYea, that I might have plucked the stars from heaven's vault,\nTo gild Olympus self for thy friendship kept!\n\nBut pray, what divining rod leads such a corrupt heart?\nDost virtue, like breath of spring's fairest lily, not touch thine own?\nArt thou cloud, which by passing winds, doth shift and afoul its form?\nAh, foul deceiver, hope's felon âˆ’\nWhat punishment severe dost thy guilt demand?\n\nYet here I stand, borne aloft by veritas and spirit valiant,\nThough my heart be scorched by fraudulent fire, still she doth endure.\nThe fates shall not forsake one so wrong'd,\nFor justice, my relentless advocate, shall unfurl.\nMay heaven's justice, by celestial decree,\nMark thee with tempest's furious trial,\nFor mine innocence sullied by thy vile betrayal.\n\nAnd thus shall history scribe thy perfidious tale,\nEternal as night's steadfast sentinel stars,\nFor treachery ne'er doth cloak its spurious shell,\nYet proud hearts, though bruised, shall never bend nor quail.\n\n(Exit LORD TREVOR, determination flickering like steel in his eyes, leaving the stage amidst the shadows that linger.)",
  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output demonstrates a clear Shakespearean style, consistent with the description provided. The monologue of LORD TREVOR employs numerous elements of Shakespearean writing, including archaic language such as \"thou,\" \"dost,\" \"hast,\" and \"methought.\" Furthermore, the speech is rich in metaphor and iambic-pentameter-like rhythm, which enhances its explorations of betrayal, loyalty, and emotional turmoil, hallmarks of Shakespeare's writing. The output successfully creates a vivid, dramatic scene in which LORD TREVOR laments betrayal with authentic Shakespearean flourishes.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
