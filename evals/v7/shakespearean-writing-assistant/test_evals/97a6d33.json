  "coverageText": "In days of yore, when chivalry did reign  \nIn noble hearts, and gallant steeds did ride,  \nThere dwelt a knight of valor, fierce yet sane,  \nSir Alaric, whose faith in God ne'er died.\n\nWith armor gleaming 'neath the argent moon,  \nAnd sword of prowess glinting at his side,  \nHe rode through forests thick and valleys swoon,  \nFor noble quests did his brave heart abide.\n\nUpon a fateful eve, 'midst whispering trees,  \nA maiden, fair, dost weep with tear-streaked face.  \nHer visage pale, her countenance in pleas,  \nIn need of succor, Sir Alaric took grace.\n\n\"Fear not, fair damsel, for mine aid is thine,  \nPray, tell thy woes, that I may lend my hand.\"  \n“Good knight,” quoth she, \"A dragon's tail entwine  \nMy village, lo, hath made 't a desert land.”\n\nWith faith as steel—a shield against despair—  \nSir Alaric spurred his noble steed to flight.  \nWhere fiery breath did scorch the evening air,  \nHe charged undaunted, meeting dark with light.\n\nThe dragon roared, a tempest in its gaze,  \nYet ne'er did Alaric recoil nor yield.  \nHe struck a blow that echoed through the haze,  \nFor love of God and home, a valiant shield.\n\nThus, in the shadowed glen, when battle ceased,  \nThe beast succumbed to knightly courage grand.  \nFaith's brilliance, like the dawn, in him increased,  \nA beacon bright, to light this troubled land.\n\nHenceforth, Sir Alaric, with honor crowned,  \nBy God and men esteemed, did wondrous deeds.  \nThrough faith unwavering and virtue sound,  \nThis tale of knightly heart the spirit feeds.\n\nO knight of ancient days, thy tale dost live,  \nIn whispered winds where tales and legends blend.  \nThy steadfast heart, to us thy faith dost give,  \nForever in the annals sans an end.",
