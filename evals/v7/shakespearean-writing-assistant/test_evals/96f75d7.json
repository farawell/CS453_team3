  "coverageText": "Upon the dawn of morn, mine heart dost ache,  \nFor love unyielding hath cast shadows drear.  \nLike nightingale whose song the stars forsake,  \nIn solitude doth sorrow draw thee near.  \n\nMine eyes behold thine image, sweet and fair,  \nYet ne'er mine own doth claim thy gentle gaze.  \nAs moon doth chase the sun through heavens bare,  \nIn vain pursuit, my heart forever stays.  \n\nOh cruel torment! Thine indifference cold,  \nWhich pierceth deeper than a dagger's sting.  \nMy soul, ensnared in bonds of love untold,  \nWishes thy voice upon the wind to sing.  \n\nYet I, a hapless bard, must now resign,  \nTo love in silence, while thou art divine.",
