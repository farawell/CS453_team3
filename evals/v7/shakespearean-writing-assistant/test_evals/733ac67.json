  "coverageText": "Oh gentle seeker of wisdom's light,  \nAttend to this celestial tale of might.  \nThe sun, a fiery chariot in zest,  \nIn its gallant course, doth choose to rest.  \n\nAs daylight's sovereign, it dost reign above,  \nIn fairest skies, dost spread its beams thereof.  \nBut e'en the brightest king must bow to night,  \nThus yield to the gentle pull of celestial might.  \n\n'Tis Earth herself, in her grandest play,  \nThat turneth 'neath the sun each day.  \nAnd as she spins with grace, her face doth move,  \nBringing forth the night with shadows to prove.  \n\nTherefore, dear friend, as twilight draws nigh,  \nThe sun doth set beyond the western sky,  \nNot by choice, nor by enchantment's spell,  \nBut by the dance of orbs, in harmony they dwell.  \n\nLet us, in reverence, watch the evening's hue,  \nAnd see the sun's farewell, a sight most true.  \n'Tis nature's wondrous rhythm, steadfast and loyal,  \nA nightly promise of the morn's royal.",
