  "validityText": "The input prompt is a request to ask a friend for companionship during a weekend getaway. According to the input specification, the prompt must involve a request or question for creative content generation that aligns with Shakespearean themes or styles. This specific input does not request the generation of creative content, nor does it mention anything regarding Shakespearean themes or styles. Instead, it appears to be a suggestion for a social activity, which directly diverges from the requirement to seek creative content in the Shakespearean context. Thus, this does not comply with the input specification.\n\nERR",
