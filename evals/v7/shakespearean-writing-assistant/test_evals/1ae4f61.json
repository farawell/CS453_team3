  "coverageText": "In the land where legends dost spring forth as blooms,  \nA valiant warrior trod 'neath stately moons;  \nHis countenance shone with brightest gleam of day,  \nAnd thus began his epic, hallowed fray.  \n\nWith steely gaze and armor burnished bright,  \nHe ventured forth into the heart of night;  \nA looming foe, with eyes as dark as sin,  \nDost wait 'mid shadows deep, his dark, grim kin.  \n\n\"Thou shalt not pass!\" the noble warrior cried,  \nAs clang of steel on steel resounded wide;  \nThe tempest roared, the very heavens quaked,  \nWhilst 'neath his feet, the ancient stones were raked.  \n\nHis sword, a blazing comet through the air,  \nSliced swift and true, with skill beyond compare;  \nThe tyrant's laugh, a chilling, bitter wail,  \nWas met with courage that dost never fail.  \n\nO timeworn dust, bear witness to his might,  \nFor ‘twas for honor and for truth he'd fight;  \nA flick’ring torch to light the shadowed wood,  \nA bastion firm 'gainst tide of ravenous flood.  \n\nBy morn's first light the battle smoke had cleared,  \nThe land was free, the foe quelled, disappeared;  \nAnd there he stood, the hero of renown,  \nWith golden laurel to bedeck his crown.  \n\nHence to the fabled halls of yore he sailed,  \nIn songs of glory his great heart prevailed;  \nAnd thus the tale of that brave warrior’s name,  \nDoth linger still, immortal as a flame.",
