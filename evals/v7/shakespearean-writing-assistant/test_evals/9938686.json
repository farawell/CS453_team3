  "coverageText": "In yon dim-lit chamber where shadows do fall,  \nA lone figure, pale, dost sit and mourn.  \nWith visage as wan as the moon's twilight pall,  \nThe lover lamenteth, by longing hath been torn.  \n\nOh, cruel distance, vile thief of sweet delight,  \nThat hath stolen my heart's most cherished stay.  \nThee, absent love, art my sun in endless night,  \nFor whom I pine both night and hapless day.  \n\nThou art fairer than the stars in heaven's deep,  \nYet I find myself in fortunes most grievous plight,  \nFor separated by vast lands do I weep,  \nIn hopes of reunition with thee, my guiding light.  \n\nTime, thou dost torture with thy slow, heavy tread,  \nWhile memories of thine embrace do haunt.  \nEach tick of thy clock an echo of dread,  \nWithin my soul dost carve, lovesick and gaunt.  \n\nOh, that I could dance upon the wings of air,  \nAnd swiftly fly to where thou dost reside.  \nTo be near thy heart, to drown in thy care,  \nIn thine arms entwined, with love as my guide.  \n\nBut till that hour when Fate bestows grace,  \nIn solitude's shadow, I must remain.  \nWith words unspoken, our hearts embrace,  \nTill Destiny dost weave anew our love's chain.  \n\nThus here on this parchment, my love shall I write,  \nWith every stroke, I whisper thy name.  \nTill we are one, united in love's pure light,  \nKnow that my heart for thee shall eternally flame.",
