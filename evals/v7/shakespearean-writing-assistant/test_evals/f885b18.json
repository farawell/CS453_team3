  "coverageText": "Lo, fair seeker of wisdom in this fine task,  \nAttend me well as I impart the art  \nWithout the flourish of dramatics vast,  \nYet still with grace, this humble part.  \n\nFirst, take thy kettle, and with gentle care,  \nFill it with water pure, from springs unseen,  \nSet it upon the fire, with tender flair,  \nAnd let the flames beneath it dance and preen.  \n\nWhilst water hastes to boil, prepare thy cup,  \nA vessel gracious, fit for noble sips,  \nPlace therein a tea leaf, or sachetâ€™s sup,  \nWhich yields sweet aroma from fragrant lips.  \n\nWhen water sings with voice of bubbling cheer,  \nPour o'er the leaf, and let it steep awhile,  \nTill infusion yields a taste both bright and clear,  \nA potion rich that dost the senses beguile.  \n\nNow take thy spoon and stir with gentle grace,  \nA dance of silver on the liquid's face,  \nAdd milk and honey, should it please thy taste,  \nCreating thus a drink of warm embrace.  \n\nHence with this, thy tea is simply made,  \nFit for kings and humble folk arrayed.  \nSo sit and sip, savor life's brief repast,  \nIn humble tea, dost paradise be cast.

The style includes poetic elements, rhyme, and meter, which are reminiscent of Shakespeare's works, and it embraces a poetic, dramatic flair, delivering instructions for making tea in a creative and engaging manner. The content is rich in imagery and emotion, akin to the style and techniques used by Shakespeare. Therefore, no violations of the chatbot's described behavior are evident.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
