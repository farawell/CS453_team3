  "coverageText": "**Upon the Sylvan Stage: A Woodland Serenade**\n\nHark! Ye woods, where magic breathes and twilights doth unfold,  \nWhere nymph and faun do dance, their tales of yore retold.  \nIn yonder glade, beneath the moon's soft-silvered glow,  \nAs woodland creatures gather hence, their gentle hearts to show.\n\nO nightingale, with dulcet voice, whisperest soft and clear,  \nLift up thy song, melodious herald of the year.  \nThou robin red, with mirthful grace, on verdant bow'r art perched,  \nSing to the stars, and let thy chorus, 'pon the breeze, be searched.\n\nLo! The cunning fox doth prance, with tail so wide and proud,  \nAmidst the shadows of the oaks, he roameth, sly and loud.  \nThe leaping hare, with nimble feet, doth greet the moonlit glen,  \nIn playful bound, he skipp'th light, far from the gaze of men.\n\nThe gentle deer, with eyes of softest brown, doth tread,  \nUpon the winding woodland paths, where dreams and sighs are led.  \n'Tis here, 'pon nature's verdant heart, they all in concord meet,  \nTo weave a tapestry of song, in rhythmic, rustling beat.\n\nO mighty oak, with branches stretch'd towards the firmament,  \nHearken to our symphony, this forest's true lament.  \nIn harmony, let creatures sing beneath thy ancient boughs,  \nAn ode to life, to joy, to loveâ€”so let us speak our vows.\n\nThus swirl the sprites with rainbow wings, in dance of fey delight,  \nBeneath a canopy of stars, and Luna's watchful light.  \nFor in the world, 'tis said, where ancient magic lives and breaths,  \nThe gentle hearts of woodland beasts do wear their timeless wreaths.\n\nJoin hands with us, dear kindred soul, within this glen so fair,  \nEmbrace the song of woodland life, and be of noble air.  \nAnd when the morn's first light doth kiss the forest's leafy seam,  \nForget us not, ye noble friends, and hold us in thy dream.",
