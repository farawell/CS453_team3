  "coverageText": "(Scene: A moonlit garden where the gentle night wind whispereth through the branches. Enter Fair Mirabelle and Noble Lysander, whose eyes are laden with sorrow. The stars that twinkle o'erhead witness their parting moment, a chorus to their lament.)\n\nFair Mirabelle:\nO dearest Lysander, how fate hath woven a cruel tapestry 'twixt our hearts! What sin hath we committed that the heavens should decree such woe upon us?\n\nNoble Lysander:\nSweet Mirabelle, mine own heart breaketh asunder at this bitter decree. The hands of destiny art unrelenting, and we must yield to its fateful grasp. Yet in mine own breast, thy love shall ever dwell, a flame that time nor separation can e'er douse.\n\nFair Mirabelle:\nYet what solace doth thy words bring when henceforth, thine absence shall deepen mine own grief? Fate, that blind and ruthless architect, hath chosen the path unkind, parting thee and I as the sea divideth lands afar. O cruel star, thou mock'st our hearts with false promise of union!\n\nNoble Lysander:\nHold thy lament, dearest heart, for in constancy our souls shall remain entwined. Though the earthly sheets part us hence, above, where the firmament stretches infinite, our love is beaconed in lights eternal.\n\n(Takes her hand, placing a gentle kiss upon it.)\n\nMark me, sweet Mirabelle, though the sun may set on this radiant day with sorrowful hues, it promise a morrow replete with our vows. Thus, in dreams shall I thee meet until fate may see fit our embrace anew. I bid thee adieu with a heart reluctant and soul steadfast.\n\nFair Mirabelle:\nO Lysander, a thousand farewells could not e'er suffice for the chasm this farewell leaves. Thine eyes shall haunt mine own like the soft gloaming that lingereth when the day is spent. I beseech thee, think on me when the gentle moon curls herself upon the night’s breast, for there shall I be, whispering love’s eternal promise.\n\n(She withdraws her hand, tears falling like silent rain to the earth below. Lysander exits, leaving Mirabelle alone amidst the shadows.)\n\nFair Mirabelle:\nThus stand I here, betwixt the shadows of yestermorn and the morrow never-born. With naught but memory to cleave unto, I walk alone 'neath the pale visage of fate's decreed parting.\n\n(The moon casteth its gentle light upon her as she departeth the stage, leaving an echo of love forever vicariously bound yet cruelly riven.)\n\nExeunt omnes.",
