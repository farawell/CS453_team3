  "coverageText": "Subject: A Humble Entreaty for Pardon Due to My Tardy Arrival\n\nMost Respected Sir/Madam,\n\nI prithee lend thine ear to my humble epistle, wherein I seek thy gracious understanding and forgiveness for my late arrival unto the place of our noble toil this morn.\n\nAlas, fate hath conspired against me, and I found myself ensnared by the ruthless hands of misfortune. The skies did rain down their tempestuous ire, causing the streets to swell with waters, impeding my swift passage hither. My steed, that trusty chariot of mechanical kind, did falter beneath the burden of inclement weather, thus delaying mine own humble self beyond the appointed hour.\n\nI beseech thee, dearest patron, to look kindly upon my request for indulgence. In sooth, 'tis my intent to strive with great diligence and effort, to regain the time lost and demonstrate my unwavering fealty to our noble cause.\n\nI await thy most esteemed leniency and stand ready to make amend for this delay most unfortunate. With deepest reverence, I remain thy devoted servant.\n\nYours in sincerest apology and earnest endeavor,\n\n[Thy Name]",
