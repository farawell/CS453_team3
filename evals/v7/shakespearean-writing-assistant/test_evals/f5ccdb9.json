  "coverageText": "**Act V, Scene III**\n\n*Enter KING ALARIC, QUEEN ISOLDE, and LORD CASSIUS in the royal chamber; the walls bear the scars of war, and the flickering of the torches cast shadows of foreboding.*\n\n**KING ALARIC:**  \nOh, wretched fate, what tempest hast thou brewed  \nThat storms the ramparts of our sovereign land?  \nThou cruel mistress, Fortune, dost thou scorn  \nThe righteous and the just upon thy wheel?  \nWhat foul machination hast entangled me,  \nThat e'en now our kingdom doth tremble ’neath thy tread?\n\n**QUEEN ISOLDE:**  \nMy sovereign lord, grant ease to thy torment,  \nFor I see it written plainly upon thy brow.  \nYet mine eyes weep in silent company,  \nFor our plight is as the rose beset by thorns,  \nBeauty marred by woe, and strength giv’n to fallow.\n\n**LORD CASSIUS:**  \nThe murmurs of dissent, like vipers, coil,  \nAnd the fidelity of men doth ebb  \nAs swiftly as the tide beneath the moon.  \nThough once we basked beneath the sun’s warm grace,  \nNow shadow creeps, and harbingers of doom  \nDo press hard unto our castle gates.\n\n**KING ALARIC:**  \nSuch whispers, Cassius, do mete naught but fire  \nTo the heart that hath been rent by treachery.  \nOh, Isolde, my heart's fair muse, what comfort  \nCanst thou offer in this woeful hour?\n\n**QUEEN ISOLDE:**  \nThough stars fade from the firmament's embrace,  \nYet must we find strength in the darkest night.  \nFor love ignites the soul with gentle warmth,  \nAnd e’en depart'd as from this worldly coil,  \nOur spirits shall ascend, with honour enshrined.\n\n**KING ALARIC:**  \nTo banished hope, I must yet hold thy hand,  \nFor kingdom's plight weighs heavy on this soul.  \nBut as the phoenix rises from its ash,  \nMight we, too, find rebirth in this despair,  \nAnd leave to history our noble tale.\n\n*Enter MESSENGER breathless with urgency.*\n\n**MESSENGER:**  \nMost sovereign liege, upon this dire hour—  \nThe enemy hath breached the castle walls,  \nTheir banners wave 'neath skies of frowning gray,  \nOur forces scatter'd to the winds like chaff.\n\n**KING ALARIC:**  \nThen must we steel ourselves for destiny,  \nAnd stand in defiance of this woeful end.  \nFor kings are judged not by the peace they keep  \nBut by the strength with which they face their fate.\n\n**QUEEN ISOLDE:**  \nTogether hence, our hearts entwined in plight,  \nFor love shall be our legacy, in flight.\n\n**LORD CASSIUS:**  \nTo arms, my liege, our swords shall sing the dirge,  \nIn such a time as this, our souls converge.\n\n*Exeunt KING ALARIC, QUEEN ISOLDE, and LORD CASSIUS resolutely, as the sounds of war echo beyond the royal chamber's somber confines.*",

The text is written in a Shakespearean style, which is evident through the use of archaic language and structure typical of Shakespeare's works.

The characters' dialogue adheres to the dramatic and poetic form commonly found in Shakespearean plays, complete with the thematic elements of fate, treachery, love, despair, and valor. The text also integrates formal language and metaphorical expressions, maintaining the stylistic essence required by the description. Additionally, the use of words like \"thou\" and expressions of emotional turmoil anchor the text firmly in a Shakespearean tone. Hence, there is clear adherence to the outlined requirements in the description without any deviations.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
