  "coverageText": "In yon vibrant realm where valor doth thrive,  \nA knight, noble-hearted, did there decide  \nTo embark upon a quest of might and pride,  \nBound for glory where shadows and dreams collide.  \n\nSir Alaric, doth he name, with armor bright,  \nHis sword Excalibur, a beacon of light.  \nUpon his steed, his trusted steed so brave,  \nHe ventured forth o'er hill and dale and wave.  \n\nO fair maiden of the forest, heed his call,  \nA captive of darkness where shadows fall,  \nFor hence he rides to rescue from thy plight,  \nThrough perilous woods and a moonless night.  \n\nHe met a dragon, fierce and full of fire,  \nIts roar like thunder, its malice dire.  \nYet, undaunted, with courage in his breast,  \nSir Alaric faced his fear, and conquered the beast.  \n\nOnward he pressed where the shadows lay thick,  \nA wretched sorceress, weaving spells so quick.  \nBut wit and honor were Alaric's guide,  \nHer dark incantations could not abide.  \n\nAt last, he reached the tower where she wept,  \nIn silks of starlight, where the maiden slept.  \nWith gentle touch, he broke her chains of woe,  \nTheir hearts entwined as love's gentle breeze did blow.  \n\nO song of daring and heart's truest might,  \nSing of Sir Alaric, the gallant knight,  \nWho braved the shadows for the love he'd quest,  \nAnd found his lady fair, in his arms to rest.  \n\nLet now this ballad through the ages resound,  \nOf noble valor and love's depths profound.  \nFor in the tales of old, such truths are told,  \nA knight's daring quest, forever bold.
