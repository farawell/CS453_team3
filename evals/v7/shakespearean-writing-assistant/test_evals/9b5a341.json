  "coverageText": "In yon grand hall of regal splendor, where resplendent tapestries on ancient stone did hang, a feast most sumptuous awaited. Gathered were the nobles, clad in resplendent garb, their silks and satins glistening like celestial hues beneath the golden glow of flick'ring chandeliers. \n\nThe tables groaned 'neath bounteous fare, fit for a king and his anointed courtly kin. Roasted fowl and venison, basting in rich sauces, did tempt the taste with their savory scent, whilst ne'er-ending goblets brimm'd with ruby wine did gleam like the starlit firmament. Exquisite fruits from lands afar'd been pluck'd, piled high as if the cornucopia of gods had spilt o’er earth, and in their jewel’d skins they promis'd bliss unspoken.\n\n Amidst such splendor pranced the madcap jesters, bedeck’d in motley garb, their caps with tinkling bells did jingle in court’s delight. In antic step and jest they liv’d, their nimbleness a delight to highborn hearts, jesting and cap’ring with abandon. With mirthful tales did they evoke great peals of laughter, as sweet musician’s tunes danced 'round the ears like fairy sprites.\n\n His Majesty, enthron’d upon his dais, smiled benevolently o'er the revels, casting his gracious gaze upon all within his ken. Nobles did engage in gallant speech, betimes in earnest discourse, betimes in couched wit so deftly woven. \n\nThus, did the night unfold with grandeur’s charm, a testament to the majesty woven through the royal hall, where laughter lingered e’er in soft embrace and noble spirits hied to seek delight 'til dawn’s first light did call.",
