  "coverageText": "**Romeo:**\n\nO fair Juliet, the night doth cloak us thus  \nIn secret shroud, where none but moon and stars  \nCast gentle gaze upon our hidden tryst.  \nYet fate, a cruel sovereign, hast crossed our paths,  \nAnd in its wake, doth leave us but with heartache.  \nDost thou perceive this love as cursed?  \n\n**Juliet:**\n\nSweet Romeo, thou speakest of destiny,  \nYet my heart with fervor beats in thy presence.  \nDoth Heaven not favor love such as ours,  \nBoundless and true, ‘gainst all of earthly chains?  \nWhat curse betwixt us canst undo this bond?  \n\n**Romeo:**\n\nIn thine eyes, I see the light of morning,  \nClearing the sable curtain of night’s despair.  \nBut know thou well the danger’s lurking near—  \nOur families, like ancient foes, do war,  \nAnd vengeful Talons in shadows do lie.  \n\n**Juliet:**\n\nIf love be poison, then blissfully I drink,  \nFor no dread fate nor enmity’s harsh glare  \nCanst dim the radiant glow that thou bring’st hence.  \nTo call thee mine, even but for a moment,  \nIs to taste of Heaven’s own sweet ambrosia.  \n\n**Romeo:**\n\nThen hide we must, beneath the veil of night,  \nRisking all for moments ‘twixt heart and hand.  \nPerchance the stars above may yet alight  \nOur path to love, unfettered, unrestrained.  \nWouldst thou defy the clamorous call of fate?  \n\n**Juliet:**\n\nWith thee by my side, I shall defy it all—  \nThese turbulent seas of fate shall part for us,  \nAnd the song of nightingales shall guide us,  \nTo a realm where love’s pure vow is fulfilled,  \nWhere destiny’s curse shall break, forsooth, in twain.  \n\n**Romeo:**\n\nThen shall we venture, hand in trembling hand,  \nInto love’s vast and uncharted domain.  \nE’en if the world’s disfavor upon us lands,  \nIn thee, my soul finds solace, sweet and plain.  \nCome, take my heart, and together we’ll soar.  \n\n**Juliet:**\n\nLead on, dear Romeo, my heart's own delight—  \nWith thee, I dream of happier morrows bright.",
