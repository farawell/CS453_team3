  "coverageText": "Oh gentle soul, whose shadow doth eclipse the very sun, lend thine ear unto this humble tongue that doth tremble to speak of hidden affection. In yonder grove where silent whispers dance upon the breeze, mine heart doth weave a tapestry of tender devotions, albeit obscured beneath nature's veil.\n\nLet not the roaring tempest disturb the slumber of thine ears, yet mark thou this clandestine murmur, born of passion's flame. For thee, whose visage recalls the fairest dawn, dost thou not see how my spirit doth wend and wander, drawn as the moon followeth the eternal course of night?\n\nIn covert guise, like a dewdrop perched upon a solitary leaf, I find mine affection wrapped in the soft shroud of secrecy. No overt proclamation upon my lips may reside, yet beneath the bounds of silence lies a reverence profound.\n\nShould the stars conspire to keep our paths entwined, know thisâ€”thy presence alone, a silent beacon, doth guide mine untutored soul through the shadowed depths of longing unvoiced. Thus, in the garden of unspoken words, I lay this tender homage at thy feet, cloaked in the gentle folds of ambiguity's embrace.",
