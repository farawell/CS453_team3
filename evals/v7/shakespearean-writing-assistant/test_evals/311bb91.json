  "coverageText": "**Scene: A Moonlit Forrest Outside the Realm of Elswyth**  \n*Characters: Lord Alaric, an ambitious noble; Lady Elara, his confidante and advisor.*\n\n*Enter LORD ALARIC, his visage marked by a fiery resolve, followed by LADY ELARA, cloaked in sable garb, the moonlight casting silver upon her brow.*\n\n**LORD ALARIC**  \n(In solitude a moment before speaking)  \nO hallowed night, thou silent sentinel of dreams!  \nIn thy embrace, ambition findeth flight,  \nTo soar on wings of destiny's bold beams.  \nWhat star doth keep its counsel with mine aim?  \n\n**LADY ELARA**  \nMy lord, if it please thee, utter thy mind,  \nFor in this grove, hush'd under heaven's veil,  \nOur words, like kindled sparks, yet unconfined,  \nShall blaze a path to glory’s golden grail.\n\n**LORD ALARIC**  \nSweet Elara, akin to trusty blade,  \nThou see'st past the shroud which clouds men’s sight.  \nAmbition, that towering tempest, hath bade  \nMe wrest the crown, though veiled by dreaded night.  \nYet, dost thou think me just in such pursuits,  \nOr art my dreams akin to vain pursuits?\n\n**LADY ELARA**  \nThy fervor, like to Atlas, bears the world,  \nNot vain, but sturdy, noble in its cause.  \nYet tread with grace, lest pride in haste unfurl'd  \nShall trip thee in thy quest and give thee pause.  \nAmbition's fire must burn, yet nor destroy,  \nElse ash shall be thy sole and joyless toy.\n\n**LORD ALARIC**  \nTrue words thou speak’st, my steadfast guiding star;  \nI shall with prudence cleave the winding path.  \nYet hear the trumpet sound from lands afar—  \n'Tis glory's call which echoes through my wrath!  \nTo thee, my faithful comrade, I do vow,  \nThat kings and constellations mine will bow.\n\n**LADY ELARA**  \nThen carry forth, with wisdom and with grace,  \nLet not the shadows dim thy noble face.  \nFor in this chase, not solely power's pursuit,  \nBut cherished legacies shalt bear the fruit.  \nThus, under heaven's watch, our pact is sealed,  \nAmbition's dance upon this earthly field.\n\n*With arms uplifted to the midnight sky, LORD ALARIC ensures that his heart beats with fierce determination, and LADY ELARA's serene eyes reflect the virtues of counsel and foresight. Together, they vanish into shadows, leaving the stage silent, save for the whispering leaves, witnessing the unfolding of fate.*\n\n*Exeunt*",
