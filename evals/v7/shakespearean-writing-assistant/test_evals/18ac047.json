  "coverageText": "In the fair town of Veresford, within the realm of Englenow, didst an auspicious event unfold, where the fates decreed a tangled web of mistaken identities.\n\nLo, it came to pass that there dwelt a noble gentleman, one Sir Almeric by name, whose visage bore an uncanny likeness to that of the merry troubadour, Percival the Gleeful. With the sun's ascent, a day of revelry was proclaimed, wherein masks adorned every visage, and merriment echoed through the cobblestone streets.\n\nAmidst the gaieties, did Sir Almeric, clad in rich silken garments, traverse the crowded square. Yet, with a flourish that didst betray his noble essence, he was beset by clamor and contagious glee, marked by the townsfolk as the japing minstrel, Percival.\n\n\"Oh, dear minstrel!\" quoth they, mistaking him for the jester knight, \"Pray, spin us a yarn that shall rival the merry melodies thou art famed for weaving!\" Startled, Sir Almeric attempted in vain to enlighten them of their folly, but their laughter did drown his protests.\n\nMeanwhile, the true Percival, robed in stolen finery most rare, strutted unknowingly into the hallowed halls of Lord Falcrest, whereupon he was heralded as the venerable knight! Beseeched by flattering tongues and revered by noble peers, the minstrel played his part with mischievous glee, dispensing wisdom with a wink and jest.\n\nThus, as the night grew old, fortune wove its strange tapestry. Sir Almeric, humbled by the townsfolk's unfettered joy, embraced his newfound role. Percival, in his masquerade of nobility, didst learn the weight and grandeur of lordly bearing.\n\nAs the moon set and dawn's light graced the land once more, the truth, a gentle breeze, unmasked their ruse. Sir Almeric and Percival, united in whimsically brewed kinship, shared a hearty laugh and vowed to remember always the merry dance of mistaken identity in the fair town of Veresford.",
