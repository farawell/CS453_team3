  "coverageText": "Hark! Attend ye to the whispers of thine ancient soul, that teacheth wisdom not bound by fleeting sands of time. As the sun doth trace its arc across the sky, so doth life wend its course through shadow and light. Prithee, embrace thy mortal sojourn with heart most resolute and spirit unyielding.\n\nSeeketh ye not the treasure of prosperity alone, for wealth is but a fickle friend, oft as transient as the morning dew. Instead, cultivate within thy breast the seeds of virtue, that bloom into a garden of everlasting contentment. Let sincerity be thy compass, and honor be thy shield, for these pillars shall ne'er crumble beneath the burdens of life's tempestuous sway.\n\nIn such wise, cherish the company of souls brave and true, that in the joyous exchange of mirth and wisdom, thy days be well accounted. And when Fate's cruel hand doth test thy mettle, bear thy troubles with dignity most profound and faith unbroken, for the trials of adversity are but the anvil upon which strength and character are forged.\n\nThus, with courage as thy steadfast steed, traverse the harrowing paths and sunlit meadows that form the tapestry of existence. Remember, noble heart, that love – in all its forms – is the fairest gift of all, a beacon that guides thee through the darkest night to dawn's gentle embrace.",
