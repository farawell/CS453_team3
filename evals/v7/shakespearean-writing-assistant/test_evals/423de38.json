  "coverageText": "In sooth, thou askest for a rhyme most gay,  \nTo celebrate thy child's sweet natal day.  \nHearken, as I spin this jovial verse,  \nAnd lift thy spirits high, the heavens rehearse!  \n\nUpon this day, a wondrous child was born,  \nAmidst the break of rosy-fingered morn.  \nFull many a lark doth sing to herald thee,  \nIn merry prank, thou roam'st wild and free.  \n\nThou art the sunbeam in thy sire's eyes,  \nWith laughter that doth rival summer skies.  \nA cake of sweets and candles bright doth wait,  \nTo mark the hour of thy blessed fete.  \n\nWith jesters' grace, mayhap a jest I'll pen,  \nTo tickle thine ears, and then again:  \n\"Why art thou liken'd to a chicken, I declare?  \nBecause thy feathers never fly despair!\"  \n\nSo, let the bells of laughter peal aloud,  \nAs kith and kin doth gather 'round in crowd.  \nRejoice! For in this time of gleeful rhyme,  \nThy birth hath brought a ray of joy sublime.  \n\nThus, may thy birthday be a mirthful jest,  \nFilled with joy, and love, and every sweetest zest.",
