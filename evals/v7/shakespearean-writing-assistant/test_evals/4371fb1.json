  "coverageText": "Oh, gentle muse, lend thy voice to mine heart's song,  \nFor beneath yon heavens where bright stars belong,  \nI dost stand, awash in their celestial light,  \nTo serenade mine love on this beauteous night.\n\nLo! Fair maiden, with eyes like radiant orbs,  \nWhose gaze doth pierce through night's encompassing robes.  \nThou art the beacon that kindles mine soul's fire,  \nThe goddess of my dreams and mine heart's desire.\n\nHark! The whisper of zephyrs in yonder trees,  \nDoth carry thy name through night's eternal seas.  \nWith sweet lullabies sung by the moon's own beams,  \nThey wrap thee 'round in a tapestry of dreams.\n\nMy heart doth beat as if to match night's own tune,  \nMatching rhythm with the celestial boon.  \nFor thy love, a treasure more vast than the skies,  \nGlows as bright as Venus' fair and lustrous eyes.\n\nI offer thee mine heart, a gift dearly scorned,  \nWith each loving word, by night's embrace adorned.  \nMay our souls entwine 'neath this star-studded dome,  \nHenceforth, beloved, thou art mine muse, mine home.",
