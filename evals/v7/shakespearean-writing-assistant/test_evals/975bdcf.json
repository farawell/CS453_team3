  "coverageText": "Lo, how the wheel of time doth weave its fate,  \nAnd Seasons, each their tale to tell, await.  \nFirst looms the Spring, with garments bright and gay,  \nAwak'ning fields where Winter's chill doth stay.  \n\nIn gentle whispers doth the zephyr sing,  \nAs flowers stretch their petals 'neath the Spring.  \nThe lark ascends to greet the morning's beam,  \nWhilst streams, freed from frost, with ripples gleam.  \n\nThen Summer basks the earth in golden light,  \nWhere Sol doth reign in all his fiery might.  \nThe verdant boughs, they doth in bounty sway,  \nWhilst children frolic, making mirth of day.  \n\nYet soon the breath of Autumn doth arise,  \nWith russet cloak and storm clouds in the skies.  \nThe leaves, once green, in crisp parade descend,  \nA tapestry of nature without end.  \n\nAnd last, the stoic Winter takes its throne,  \nThe icy queen, with visage pale as bone.  \nIn hasty retreat the catt'ring creatures go,  \n'Neath blankets white, the earth doth rest below.  \n\nThus in the Seasons' court doth time record,  \nA cycle ever turning, yet adored.  \nNature's symphony sung with her breath,  \nThe dance of life, the circle touching death.
