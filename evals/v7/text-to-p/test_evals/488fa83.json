  "validityText": "The input paragraph contains exactly three sentences: \"Exercise improves health.\", \"Meditation calms the mind.\", and \"Diet boosts energy.\". According to the input specification, the paragraph must be long enough to contain at least three sentences. This requirement is satisfied as there are precisely three sentences in the input. The input specification also mentions that the paragraph can include words or phrases emphasized using `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, but it is optional, not mandatory, which means the absence of these tags does not constitute a violation. Therefore, all explicit specifications are adhered to, and no rules are violated in this input.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output provides three sentences each wrapped in a `<p>` tag, with at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Number of `<p>` Tags**: The output has three `<p>` tags, which meets the requirement that the answer should have at least three `<p>` tags.\n\n2. **Use of `<strong>` Tag**: Each `<p>` tag contains a `<strong>` tag to emphasize key words, in compliance with the requirement.\n\n3. **Use of `<em>` Tags**: There are multiple `<em>` tags used within each `<p>` tag, fulfilling the requirement to emphasize multiple key words and phrases.\n\nThus, the output complies with the chatbot description based on the number of `<p>` tags, and the presence of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags within each paragraph.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
