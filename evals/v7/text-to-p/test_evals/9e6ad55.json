  "validityText": "The provided input is a paragraph consisting of three sentences. Let's evaluate the compliance with each element of the input specification:\n\n1. **Paragraph of text**: The input is a paragraph of text, which is coherent and structured.\n\n2. **At least three sentences**: The paragraph does indeed contain three sentences - \"Rain falls from the sky.\", \"Clouds gather in the horizon.\", and \"Storms brew unpredictably.\"\n\n3. **HTML formatting with <strong> and <em> tags**: The specification mentions that the paragraph \"can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags.\" However, it does not mandate the inclusion of emphasized words or phrases with these tags. Therefore, the absence of <strong> and <em> tags does not violate the input specification.\n\nConsidering the above points, the input is compliant because it meets the requirement of being a paragraph of at least three sentences without any restrictions on the necessity of HTML tags.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
