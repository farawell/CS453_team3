The given input contains exactly three sentences: \"Paths intertwine.\", \"Journeys diverge.\", and \"Destinations await.\" Therefore, it meets the requirement of having at least three sentences. The specification also allows for words or phrases to be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags, but this is not a requirement, so the lack of such tags in the input does not constitute a violation.\n\nThe input complies with all aspects of the provided input specification:\n1. It is a paragraph of text.\n2. It contains at least three sentences.\n3. There is no additional requirement for <strong> or <em> tags, so their absence does not violate the specification.\n\nNo violations found.\nOK",
