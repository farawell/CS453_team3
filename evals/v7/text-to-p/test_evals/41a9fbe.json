  "validityText": "The input provided consists of three distinct sentences: \"Love enriches life.\", \"Friendship strengthens bonds.\", and \"Family supports.\" According to the input specification, the paragraph should contain at least three sentences, which is satisfied by this input. However, the paragraph does not include any words or phrases that have been formatted using <strong> or <em> tags. The input specification states that the paragraph \"can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags,\" which means there is no requirement for such tags to be present. Therefore, this part of the specification is optional and does not cause a non-compliance.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the input satisfies the rule of having at least three sentences, and there is no requirement for emphasis tags to be present for compliance. There is no violation of the input specification.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The evaluation process involves checking the chatbot's output against the description provided. According to the description, the output must have at least three `<p>` tags. In the given output, there are three `<p>` tags, which satisfies this requirement. Additionally, inside each `<p>` tag, there should be one `<strong>` tag, and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. \n\nLet's break down the output:\n1. The first `<p>` tag: It contains one `<strong>` tag (Love) and one `<em>` tag (enriches). There is no violation here because the requirement is for multiple `<em>` tags but not in each `<p>` tag.\n2. The second `<p>` tag: It contains one `<strong>` tag (Friendship) and two `<em>` tags (strengthens, bonds). This is fully compliant.\n3. The third `<p>` tag: It contains one `<strong>` tag (Family) and one `<em>` tag (supports). Similar to the first `<p>` tag, this does not conflict with the requirement as there is no specific number of `<em>` tags required in each sentence other than multiple across the document.\n\nThe description requires multiple `<em>` tags throughout the document, not necessarily in each `<p>`. As there are three `<p>` tags in total, and multiple `<em>` tags appear across the whole output, the output is compliant with the description. Therefore, the output satisfies all the requirements specified.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
