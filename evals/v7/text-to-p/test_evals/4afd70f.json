  "input": "Television entertains. Radio informs. Internet connects.",
  "validityText": "The input provided is a paragraph of text that seems to consist of three sentences: \"Television entertains.\" \"Radio informs.\" \"Internet connects.\" According to the input specification, the paragraph must be long enough to contain at least three sentences, which this paragraph does. However, the specification also notes that paragraphs can include words or phrases emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags. The lack of emphasis does not violate the specification as that part implies the inclusion of emphasis is optional, not mandatory.\n\nIn assessing the input specification, no rules mandate a minimum length beyond three sentences or specific content structures beyond the presence of sentences. There is no indication that further content or complexity is required, nor is there any stipulation that a broader thematic exploration or argument development is necessary. Thus, there is compliance based on the criteria of containing three sentences.\n\nNo violation of the specifications is present since the paragraph meets the minimum number of sentences, with no contradictory element represented.\n\nOK",
