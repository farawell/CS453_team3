  "validityText": "The input is a paragraph that needs to be formatted as HTML, but this evaluation step does not require us to format it, only to decide if it complies with the input specifications.\n\nUpon examining the provided input, it contains three distinct sentences: \"Birds fly high.\", \"Fish swim deep.\", and \"Animals live free.\" This satisfies the requirement that the paragraph must be long enough to contain at least three sentences. \n\nHowever, there is no mention of any words or phrases that are emphasized using <strong> or <em> tags in the input. Despite this, the input specification doesn't explicitly require the presence of emphasized words or phrases; it only states that the paragraph \"can\" include such elements. Therefore, the absence of emphasized tags is acceptable and does not constitute a violation.\n\nAs a result, given that the input adheres to the requirement for minimum sentence count and the optionality of emphasis tags, the input complies with the provided specification.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output consists of three sentences, each wrapped in a `<p>` tag. This complies with the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags. Inside each `<p>` tag, there is one `<strong>` tag, which aligns with the instruction to add one `<strong>` tag per sentence. Additionally, there are multiple `<em>` tags in each sentence, fulfilling the guideline of adding multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases.\n\nNo violation.\n\nOK",
