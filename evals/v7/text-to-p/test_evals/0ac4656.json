  "validityText": "The given input consists of three sentences: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\", \"Cats sleep all day.\", and \"Dogs bark at strangers.\". This satisfies the requirement of containing at least three sentences as specified in the input guidelines.\n\nThe input specification also mentions that words or phrases can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags, but it does not require that every input must contain these tags. Therefore, the absence of emphasized tags does not constitute a violation of the input specification.\n\nAs for the requirement to be formatted as HTML, the specification does not explicitly state that the input must already include HTML formatting or tags; rather, it implies that the paragraph of text needs to be suitable for HTML formatting. Since the input is free of technical issues that would prevent it from being formatted as HTML, it complies with this requirement.\n\nBased on these observations, the input complies with the input specification.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The output consists of three `<p>` tags, which fulfills the requirement of \"Your answer should have at least three <p> tags.\" Each `<p>` tag contains at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which meets the guideline of adding a `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases inside each `<p>` tag.\n\n1.
