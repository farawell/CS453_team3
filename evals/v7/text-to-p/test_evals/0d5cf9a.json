However, the input specification also states that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using `<strong>` and `<em>` tags. While this characteristic is optional, it means the presence or absence of emphasized words doesn't violate the specification. The primary requirement is met, as there are three sentences.\n\nOK",
