  "validityText": "The input provided is a paragraph consisting of three sentences: \"History educates us.\", \"Lessons are learned.\", and \"Mistakes are avoided.\" \n\nAccording to the input specification, the paragraph must be long enough to contain at least three sentences. The given input satisfies this condition as it contains exactly three sentences.\n\nHowever, there is a potential issue according to the input specification. The specification mentions that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags. Although this is not a strict requirement, there is an expectation for potential words or phrases to be emphasized, which is absent in this input.\n\nSince the inclusion of <strong> and <em> tags is not explicitly mandatory for compliance, the main requirement is that there are at least three sentences, which this input satisfies. Therefore, no rules from the input specification are technically violated.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "Upon evaluating the chatbot output, it appears to adhere to the description provided. Here's the reasoning behind the decision:\n\n1. **Split into Sentences and Use of `<p>` Tags**: The output contains three `<p>` tags, each indicating a separate sentence. This complies with the requirement to split the paragraph into individual sentences and wrap each with a `<p>` tag.\n\n2. **Inclusion of `<strong>` Tag**: Each `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag, which is in line with the instruction to add one `<strong>` tag inside each `<p>` tag.\n\n3. **Inclusion of `<em>` Tags**: Each `<p>` tag contains multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases, fulfilling the requirement to use multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag.\n\nAll the listed conditions within the chatbot's description are met in the provided HTML output. Therefore, there are no detected violations of the given guidelines.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
