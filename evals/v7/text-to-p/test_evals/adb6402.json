  "validityText": "The input provided is a paragraph consisting of three sentences: \"Programming languages evolve.\", \"Developers write efficient code.\", and \"Bugs need fixing.\".\n\nAccording to the input specification, the paragraph must be long enough to contain at least three sentences. This input does indeed have three sentences, satisfying the first requirement of having the minimum number of sentences.\n\nThe specification also mentions that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags, but it does not mandate their presence in the paragraph. Therefore, the lack of emphasized words or phrases does not constitute a violation of the input specification.\n\nThus, the input complies with all the requirements of the provided specification.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The evaluation of the chatbot's output is as follows:\n\n1. **HTML Structure**: The output provided is wrapped in appropriate HTML structure including the `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. This shows proper HTML format, which is nice to see.\n\n2. **Paragraph Compliance**: The description requests that the paragraph be split into individual sentences and each wrapped in a `<p>` tag. The output contains three `<p>` tags, which satisfies the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags. Therefore, it complies with the format requirement.\n\n3. **Use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags**: Each paragraph contains exactly one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which aligns with the bot's description of highlighting key words and phrases using these tags.\n\nGiven these evaluations, the output aligns completely with the chatbot description as per the rules which do not require knowing the input.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
