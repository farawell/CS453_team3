  "validityText": "The input specification requires that the paragraph contains at least three sentences. Upon review, the input indeed contains three sentences: \"Laughter is the best medicine.\", \"Smiles are contagious.\", and \"Happiness is shared.\". \n\nThe input specification also states that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags. However, it does not require that these tags must be present; it simply allows for the possibility. The absence of these tags in the input does not constitute a violation of the input specification.\n\nTherefore, the input complies with the requirement of containing at least three sentences, and since the use of <strong> and <em> tags is optional, this does not affect compliance.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
