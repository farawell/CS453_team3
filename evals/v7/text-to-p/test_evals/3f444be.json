  "input": "The cat sits on the mat. Dogs bark loudly. Birds chirp in the morning.",
  "validityText": "The input provided consists of three sentences: \"The cat sits on the mat.\", \"Dogs bark loudly.\", and \"Birds chirp in the morning.\". The input specification requires the text to be in the form of a paragraph with at least three sentences. It also mentions that the paragraph can contain words or phrases that can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags, but it does not require them. Simply having at least three sentences fulfills the first requirement of the input specification. The text provided indeed contains three sentences, thus meeting the minimum requirement. There is no indication in the input specification that the sentences must also already include the <strong> and <em> tags or any other HTML formatting, only that they can include them. Hence, the input satisfies this optional condition as well.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output is evaluated as follows:\n\n1. **Presence of <p> Tags**: The output contains three `<p>` tags, which satisfies the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n\n2. **Use of <strong> and <em> Tags**: \n   - In the first `<p>` tag: It contains one `<strong>` tag around \"The cat\" and multiple `<em>` tags (\"sits\", \"on\", \"mat\").\n   - In the second `<p>` tag: It contains one `<strong>` tag around \"Dogs\" and multiple `<em>` tags (\"bark\", \"loudly\").\n   - In the third `<p>` tag: It contains one `<strong>` tag around \"Birds\" and multiple `<em>` tags (\"chirp\", \"in\", \"morning\").\n\n3. **General Structure**: The structure follows proper HTML formatting by including the `DOCTYPE`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. However, the chatbot description specifically focuses on formatting sentences with `<p>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>` tags rather than the full HTML document structure. But, since that isn't directly against the description, we ignore this extra detail for compliance checking.\n\nSince all provided requirements are met directly by the output, the output complies with the chatbot description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
