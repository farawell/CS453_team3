  "input": "Cars run fast. Bicycles ride slower. Trains travel far.",
  "validityText": "The input text consists of three separate sentences. Each sentence provides a statement about different modes of transportation. This satisfies the requirement from the input specification that necessitates the inclusion of at least three sentences in the paragraph.\n\nHowever, the input specification also mentions that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using `<strong>` and `<em>` tags. While this is not strictly mandatory as per the specification (the input \"can\" include these tags, it doesn't \"must\"), it still allows for the potential inclusion of emphasized text without the specification's compliance being strictly mandatory.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, the text inputs meet the primary requirement which is having at least three sentences. There is no clear requirement compelling the presence of `<strong>` or `<em>` tags. Their presence is optional according to the specification, permitting but not necessitating emphasis.\n\nI therefore conclude that there is no breach of criteria in the provided input.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The given output complies with the description provided for the following reasons:\n\n1. The output contains three `<p>` tags, which matches the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags in the output.\n\n2. Within each `<p>` tag, there is one `<strong>` tag used, which satisfies the requirement to add a `<strong>` tag inside each `<p>` tag.\n\n3. Each `<p>` tag contains multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases, further aligning with the description's requirements.\n\nTherefore, the output is in direct compliance with the requirements outlined, and no violations of the description are detected.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
