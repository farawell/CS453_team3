The specification allows for the inclusion of emphasized text but does not require it.\n\nBased on the provided input specification, the input fulfills the requirement of containing at least three sentences, and there are no explicit requirements regarding the necessity of HTML tags for emphasis, only the allowance for them if the author chooses to include such emphasis.\n\nTherefore, this input complies with the input specification.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The evaluation process requires examining the chatbot output to determine if it complies with the specification given in the description. Hereâ€™s the analysis of the output provided:\n\n1. **Three `<p>` Tags**: The output contains three `<p>` tags:\n   - `<p>Art can be <em>interpreted</em> in many <strong>ways</strong>.</p>`\n   - `<p><strong>Colors</strong> evoke <em>emotions</em>.</p>`\n   - `<p><em>Lines</em> define <strong>space</strong>.</p>`\n   \n   This matches the requirement to have at least three `<p>` tags.\n\n2. **Inclusion of `<strong>` Tag in Each `<p>` Tag**: Each `<p>` tag contains a `<strong>` tag:\n   - First `<p>`: `<strong>ways</strong>`\n   - Second `<p>`: `<strong>Colors</strong>`\n   - Third `<p>`: `<strong>space</strong>`\n\n   This complies with the requirement to include one `<strong>` tag inside each `<p>` tag.\n\n3. **Use of `<em>` Tags**: Each `<p>` tag contains at least one `<em>` tag:\n   - First `<p>`: `<em>interpreted</em>`\n   - Second `<p>`: `<em>emotions</em>`\n   - Third `<p>`: `<em>Lines</em>`\n\n   This aligns with the requirement for multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize keywords or phrases, although there's no direct indication of \"multiple\" beyond one, it meets the \"at least\" condition by having at least one in each.\n\nAs per the description, the requirements for the HTML formatting have been met. No direct requirement specifies a minimum number of `<em>` tags beyond \"multiple,\" which can be interpreted as at least one per sentence, provided it falls in line with standard usage. Overall, the output adheres directly to the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
