  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output contains a valid HTML document structure with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags, all of which are expected in an HTML document but are not part of the formatting guidelines provided for the paragraph. The paragraph is split into three sentences, each wrapped in a `<p>` tag, which meets the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags. In each `<p>` tag, there is also an inclusion of at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which complies with the chatbot description.\n\nThe first sentence `<p><strong>Water</strong> is <em>essential</em>.</p>` contains one `<strong>` tag and one `<em>` tag, the second sentence `<p>We <strong>drink</strong> it <em>daily</em>.</p>` includes one `<strong>` tag and one `<em>` tag, and the third sentence `<p><strong>Rivers</strong> and <strong>lakes</strong> supply it <em>abundantly</em>.</p>` hosts two `<strong>` tags and one `<em>` tag. Since each sentence meets the requirement of having at least one `<strong>` and multiple `<em>` tags, the output complies with the description.\n\nNo violations are detected, as the conditions set by the description are met by the output provided.\n\nOK",
