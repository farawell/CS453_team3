  "validityText": "The input is a paragraph of text, which is expected to contain at least three sentences according to the specification. Here, the input provides exactly three sentences: \"Technology advances rapidly.\", \"Innovations lead to new discoveries.\" and \"Society adapts slowly.\". This satisfies the sentence requirement.\n\nNext, the specification allows for the inclusion of emphasized words or phrases using `<strong>` and `<em>` tags. However, it does not state that the presence of these tags is mandatory. Therefore, the absence of such tags does not violate the specification.\n\nGiven that the input consists of three sentences and the absence of emphasis tags is acceptable, this input complies with the input specification.\n\nOK",
