  "validityText": "The input provided consists of three sentences: \"Mountains rise.\", \"Valleys fall.\", and \"Oceans expand.\". According to the input specification, the input should be a paragraph of text long enough to contain at least three sentences. This input contains exactly three sentences, which is the minimum required, thus satisfying the sentence length specification.\n\nHowever, the input specification also mentions that the paragraph \"needs to be formatted as HTML\", which implies the use of HTML tags to format these sentences. The input does not include any such HTML formatting or tags, particularly the <strong> and <em> tags mentioned as possibilities in the specification.\n\nThe input does not comply with the specification as it lacks any formatting as HTML. There are no HTML tags used in the input, which is a requirement based on the need for the paragraph to be formatted as HTML per the specification. The specific rule from the input specification that the input violates is the requirement for the paragraph to be formatted as HTML.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the input is not compliant with the input specification due to the absence of HTML formatting.\n\nERR",

  "coverageEvalText": "The output provided adheres to the description by containing three separate sentences wrapped in `<p>` tags, as required. Each `<p>` tag includes one `<strong>` tag to emphasize a key word and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize other key words or phrases. Specifically:\n\n1. The sentence \"Mountains rise with unmatched majesty.\" is wrapped in a `<p>` tag and includes `<strong>Mountains</strong>`, `<em>rise</em>`, and `<em>majesty</em>`.\n2. The sentence \"Valleys gently fall, creating serene landscapes.\" is wrapped in a `<p>` tag and includes `<strong>Valleys</strong>`, `<em>fall</em>`, and `<em>landscapes</em>`.\n3. The sentence \"Oceans ceaselessly expand, covering vast terrains.\" is wrapped in a `<p>` tag and includes `<strong>Oceans</strong>`, `<em>expand</em>`, and `<em>terrains</em>`.\n\nThe HTML structure also includes a standard document type declaration, head, and body section, but this does not affect compliance with the core requirement of formatting the text as described. Therefore, the output complies with the description as it satisfies the requirement to have at least three `<p>` tags with the appropriate nested `<strong>` and `<em>` tags. \n\nOK",
