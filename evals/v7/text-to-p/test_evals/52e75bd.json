  "input": "Markets fluctuate daily. Investors study trends. Stocks gain value.",
  "validityText": "The input is a paragraph of text that contains exactly three sentences: \"Markets fluctuate daily.\", \"Investors study trends.\", and \"Stocks gain value.\" According to the input specification, the paragraph must be long enough to contain at least three sentences. This input meets that requirement.\n\nHowever, the input specification also mentions that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using `<strong>` and `<em>` tags. While the specification states that these tags can be used, it does not explicitly require them. Therefore, the absence of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags does not indicate a non-compliance with the specification.\n\nTherefore, considering the requirements and evaluating the provided input, it complies with the input specification by containing at least three sentences. There are no violations of the specification.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output is given in HTML format with multiple sentences, each wrapped in a separate `<p>` tag. As per the description, the output should contain at least three `<p>` tags. In this case, there are exactly three `<p>` tags, which satisfies the requirement.\n\nAdditionally, the description requires the inclusion of at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag. Upon reviewing each `<p>` tag:\n\n1. `<p>Markets <strong>fluctuate</strong> <em>daily</em>.</p>` - Contains one `<strong>` tag and one `<em>` tag.\n2. `<p><strong>Investors</strong> <em>study</em> <em>trends</em>.</p>` - Contains one `<strong>` tag and two `<em>` tags.\n3. `<p>Stocks <strong>gain</strong> <em>value</em>.</p>` - Contains one `<strong>` tag and one `<em>` tag.\n\nAll `<p>` tags meet the requirement of having at least one `<strong>` tag. The second `<p>` tag meets the requirement of having multiple `<em>` tags. However, the first and third `<p>` tags only contain one `<em>` tag each, which does not meet the requirement for multiple `<em>` tags in each `<p>` tag. As a result, the output does not comply with the specification of having multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag.\n\nTherefore, the violation is the lack of multiple `<em>` tags in the first and third `<p>` tags, leading to non-compliance with the chatbot's description.\n\nERR",
