  "validityText": "The input provided is a paragraph of text. Let's evaluate it according to the input specification:\n\n1. **Length Requirement**: The input consists of three sentences: \"Life is beautiful.\", \"We cherish every moment.\", and \"Live with purpose.\". The specification requires at least three sentences, and this input meets that requirement precisely.\n\n2. **HTML Formatting Requirement**: The specification states that the paragraph needs to be formatted as HTML. However, the input given is plain text without any HTML tags or structure. \n\n3. **Emphasis Requirement**: There is no usage of <strong> or <em> tags for emphasis on words or phrases within the text.\n\nGiven these considerations, while the input meets the sentence requirement, it lacks HTML formatting and therefore does not comply with the specification's requirement for HTML formatting.\n\nERR",
