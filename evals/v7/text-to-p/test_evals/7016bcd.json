  "validityText": "The input provided is a paragraph of text. According to the input specification, the paragraph must be long enough to contain at least three sentences. The given input does indeed consist of three sentences: \"Time passes.\", \"Memories fade.\", and \"New opportunities arise.\" Thus, it satisfies the minimum sentence requirement.\n\nThe specification also mentions that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags, but it does not impose that as a requirement. Therefore, the absence of emphasized text does not result in a violation.\n\nHence, there is no non-compliance with the input specification based on the given criteria.\n\nOK",
