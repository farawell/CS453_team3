  "validityText": "The input consists of a paragraph with three sentences: \"Birds fly high.\" \"Fish swim deep.\" \"Animals roam the earth.\" These sentences meet the criterion of being a paragraph long enough to contain at least three sentences, as specified in the input specification.\n\nThe input specification mentions that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags. However, this is optional, not mandatory. The absence of these tags does not constitute a violation of the specification.\n\nTherefore, based on a direct and explicit evaluation against the input specification, there is no violation present in the input provided. It fully complies with the requirement of having at least three sentences in the paragraph.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The output consists of an HTML document which includes multiple sentences, each wrapped in a `<p>` tag. Here are my observations:\n\n1. **Number of `<p>` Tags**: The description specifies that there should be a minimum of three `<p>` tags, and the output meets this requirement by containing exactly three `<p>` tags.\n\n2. **Use of `<strong>` and `<em>` Tags**: Each `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which is in compliance with the requirement to emphasize key words and phrases inside each paragraph.\n\n3. **Structure Compliance**: The HTML structure as provided is correct, containing the necessary doctype, head, and body elements. However, my evaluation does not focus on correctness, only on compliance with the direct requirements specified in the description.\n\nGiven all the above points, the chatbot's output is in compliance with the instructions provided in the description, as all `<p>` tags have the required `<strong>` and `<em>` tags.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
