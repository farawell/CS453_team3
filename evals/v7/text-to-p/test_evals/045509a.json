  "input": "Learning is continuous. Growth is endless. Exploration is key.",
  "validityText": "The input consists of a paragraph containing three sentences: \"Learning is continuous.\", \"Growth is endless.\", and \"Exploration is key.\". These sentences meet the requirement of containing at least three sentences as specified. The input specification does not require sentences to be particularly long or detailed, just that there are three sentences, which is satisfied here. However, there is no usage of <strong> or <em> tags in the text, but the specification mentions that paragraph \"can include words or phrases\" that can be emphasized with these tags, not that it must. Thus, their absence does not constitute a violation of the input specification. Therefore, the given input is in compliance with the specification.\n\nOK",
