  "validityText": "The given input is a paragraph with three sentences: \"Art inspires.\", \"Music intrigues.\", and \"Dance liberates.\". According to the input specification, the paragraph needs to be long enough to contain at least three sentences, which is satisfied as the input contains exactly three sentences. Furthermore, the input specification mentions that the paragraph can include words or phrases that can be emphasized using <strong> and <em> tags, but it is not a requirement. The input does not violate any other rules from the specification, as the presence or absence of <strong> and <em> usage is optional. Hence, the input complies with the input specification.\n\nOK",

The paragraph should be split into individual sentences, and each sentence should be wrapped in its own `<p>` tag.\n2. Each `<p>` tag must contain at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases.\n3. The output should contain at least three `<p>` tags.\n\nUpon evaluating the given output:\n- The output contains three `<p>` tags, which meets the requirement of at least three tags.\n- Each `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag, which is in compliance.\n- However, each `<p>` tag contains only one `<em>` tag and the requirement is for multiple `<em>` tags. The output does not comply with this requirement as it only contains a single `<em>` tag in each `<p>`, not multiple as specified.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the output does not fully comply with the description provided.\n\nERR",
