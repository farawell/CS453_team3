  "input": "Math is logical. Science is experimental. History is informative.",
  "validityText": "The input provided is a paragraph of text. To determine its compliance with the input specification, we need to assess the following:\n\n1. **Length Requirement**: The input must be a paragraph long enough to contain at least three sentences. The input provided has three sentences: \"Math is logical.\", \"Science is experimental.\", and \"History is informative.\", which satisfies the condition of having at least three sentences.\n\n2. **HTML Formatting Requirement**: The input needs to be formatted as HTML. However, the input provided is plain text and does not include any HTML tags such as <strong> or <em> for emphasis. There is no HTML formatting applied to the paragraph, which is a requirement according to the input specification.\n\nDue to the lack of HTML formatting in the text, the input does not meet the input specification. The thinking process was to first verify if the paragraph had at least three sentences, which it does, and then check for HTML formatting, which it lacks.\n\nERR",
