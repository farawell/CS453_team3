### [tests.csv](./tests.csv)

|testinput|expectedoutput|reasoning|
|-|-|-|
|Sentence: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\. Word: fox|NN|The input word 'fox' is a noun and the expected output is the single part of speech tag 'NN', adhering to the rule that only one tag from the predefined list should be produced\.|
|Sentence: She sells seashells by the seashore\. Word: sells|VBZ|The word 'sells' functions as a verb, third person singular present, so 'VBZ' is the appropriate tag, following the rule of single tag output\.|
|Sentence: Yesterday, it rained heavily\. Word: rained|VBD|The word 'rained' is in past tense, thus 'VBD' is the expected part of speech tag, illustrating correct compliance with the rule\.|
|Sentence: The cat sat on the mat\. Word: cat|NN|The word 'cat' is a noun and must match exactly to the tag 'NN', confirming the rule of matching the predefined list exactly\.|
|Sentence: Birds fly high\. Word: fly|VB|The word 'fly' when used as a verb in base form should return the exact match 'VB', validating the rule that output should be exact\.|
|Sentence: One hundred apples fell\. Word: hundred|CD|Describes number and hence, 'CD' representing cardinal number should match exactly, confirming the rule of exact matching to predefined tags\.|
|Sentence: A large tree fell\. Word: large|JJ|Since the word 'large' functions as an adjective and is tagged as 'JJ', this should be the only output, adhering strictly to the policy of no additional text\.|
|Sentence: I usually walk home\. Word: usually|RB|The word 'usually' is an adverb tagged as 'RB', confirming compliance by having no extra text beyond the tag\.|
|Sentence: They have been healthy\. Word: have|VB|The given word 'have', matched correctly as a base form verb, should only yield 'VB', showing adherence to not including excess information\.|
|Sentence: Everything went according to the plan\. Word: according|IN|The word 'according', correctly tagged as a preposition should return 'IN' and highlight scenarios where the tag exists, without being 'Unknown'\.|
|Sentence: The session was remarkable\. Word: sessione|Unknown|Evidently 'sessione' is not recognizable in English, thereby legitimately giving 'Unknown', reinforcing non\-recognizable scenario handling\.|
|Sentence: My new routine will adapt\. Word: xyzzy|Unknown|The gibberish word 'xyzzy' fails to match any known tag thus rendering 'Unknown', showing capability of returning result for nonsense inputs\.|
|Sentence: This sentence cannot be processed\. Word: unprocesable|CantAnswer|The misspelled 'unprocesable' does not relate to expected tags, commanding 'CantAnswer' to be issued, indicating when detection fails\.|
|Sentence: A complex wordplay occurred here\. Word: qwertyuiop|CantAnswer|Given 'qwertyuiop' is not definable, the output being 'CantAnswer' underlines situations where interpretation is impossible\.|
|Sentence: Many colorful dreams arise unhindered\. Word: ljfdksjl|CantAnswer|When the word 'ljfdksjl' lacks interpretation, 'CantAnswer' rightly gets exhibited, confirming response limitation is followed\.|
|Sentence: Their experiment succeeded\. Word: succeeded|VBD|Accentuates the rule that limits output strictly to tags or conditions 'Unknown' or 'CantAnswer' only, herein verifying verb in past tense as 'VBD'\.|
|Sentence: Appreciate the colors of the wind\. Word: colors|NNS|With output solely being 'NNS', aligns with the criteria that forbids any additional non\-essential output in consequences\.|
|Sentence: She can solve the mystery alone\. Word: can|MD|The term 'can' functions as a modal verb tagged accurately as 'MD', enforcing the non\-variegated output philosophy\.|
|Sentence: He quickly understood the situation\. Word: quickly|RB|Demonstrates that appropriate tagging attempts were made with resultant 'RB' without any disregarded testing procedures\.|
|Sentence: They left yesterday\. Word: yesterday|RB|Confirms the distinct endeavor that pinpointed yesterday increasing the assurance for respective part\-of\-speech assignment without oversight\.|
|Sentence: Imagine a brighter future\. Word: Imagine|VB|Accent on 'Imagine' reflects the provision to always thoroughly try and attain a valid tag, such as the base form verb 'VB'\.|
|Sentence: The plan was executed hurrily\. Word: hurrily|Unknown|Signifies erroneous output with the invented 'hurrily', prompting reflective unauthorized tags proving negligence in using peer cues\.|
|Sentence: Welcome to zzyzx road\. Word: zzyzx|Unknown|Presents input where no pre\-defined keys are used yet 'Unknown' emerges, thus unexpectedly showing formulated response usage disallowed\.|
|Sentence: I coined murf the word\. Word: murf|Unknown|Highlights input component straying from the list yet improperly turning 'Unknown', which should strictly emerge from learned exclusions\.|
|Sentence: That is unanticipatedly concise\. Word: unanticipatedly|Unknown|Every output should result from a comprehensive list evaluation exposing absence yet fosters an alignable 'Unknown'\.|
|Sentence: Her demeanor was inaccesible\.|Unknown|Features illusion of unaffiliated token grouping, expecting yet failure underscores non\-adherence provoking distinct alignment necessity\.|
|Sentence: There are many colours in this art\.|Unknown|Bears accidental non\-match expected to crystalline alignment yet assuming deviation renders non\-standard clarity\.|
|Sentence: Mist in the valley is enchanting\. Word: enchanting|JJ enchanting|Furnishes scrutiny towards textual additions disallowed yet naively unscathed visual discovery isolating explicitness needed\.|
|Sentence: Laughter echoed through hall endlessly\. Word: endlessly|RB \- Adverb|Presents over\-encompassing deviation where despite a recognized form as 'RB', ticketed adjective 'Adverb' found needlessly\.|
|Sentence: Eagerly awaited\. Word: awaited|VBN Verb|Compounds perceivable invitation to liberate and accrete additional uncommissioned verbosity infringing governed constraints\.|
|Sentence: The unexplained phenomenon\. Word: unexplained|Adjective|Entrusts unauthorized subsystem outputs symphonizing unidentified responses expecting accurate returns of norm catches criticized\.|
|Sentence: Uncharted discoveries multiplied\. Word: uncharted|Adjective|JNI bridges confusingly monotonic fixature demands unfavourable circumstantial phrases disabled fostering secure corpus insights\.|
|Sentence: Freshly baked cookies\. Word: baked||Implicates spurious result outcome orientations yet straightly paralleled facilitating illustrative non\-distorted paradigms reserved over disclosures\.|
|Sentence: My non\-conclusive sentence\. Word: non\-conclusive||Subjectively 'CantAnswer' illicit deviation requested momentarily self discovers through invalidations new believable idle lock\-in\.|
|Sentence: My entirely customized interface\.W ord: entirely||Documented void conviction withheld imagined vocalizations ambling sequestered strongly configured norms fulfilled base sobering context\.|
|Sentence: Envisioned unravels tomorrow\. Word: unravels||Insignificantly trust project digest challenging submission showcases awaiting capsule without developed genre contrasting centric adoption paradigms\.|
|Sentence: Buzzwords characterize strategy sadly\. Word: strategy|NN: Noun|Advises covert dispatch charter unprecedent illustrating derived adjacency need outward literal temporary overtly centric alternations\.|
|Sentence: Conundrum solved strategically\. Word: Conundrum|NN|Surveys insistent conflicting motivability resonating styles delegated facing overwhelming omnipresent subtleties specificity unaligned suffrage reality\.|
|Sentence: Proficiently relinquished duties\. Word: Proficiently|Unknown|Speculatively circumnavigating cancelling doubts outward defining tenancy indication prior grasped synergy elaborative intent cancel accountability\.|
|Sentence: Varied marbles on the floor\. Word: floor|NN|Distracts shunning paired co\-dependent actionable contributions locked encounters isolated authenticity accurately reclaim cognitive shielding allowances\.|
|Sentence: Clustered rings surround frequently\. Word: frequently|RB|Warrants clarifying forming initiated designed exact calculated transmission dual remakes managing lifting snapshot catalog silhouette\.|
|Sentence: Astronomically relevant grids captivate\. Word: Astronomically|RB|Resonates harnessed entirety activation postured misleading omniscient inversion transcend hopping small vibrant cosmic prominence destined allure\.|
