  "rule": "If the word provided in the input cannot be assigned any of the listed part of speech tags, the output should only contain the word \"Unknown\".",
  "input": "Sentence: Everything went according to the plan. Word: according",
  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence: \"Everything went according to the plan.\" and a word: \"according\". \n\n- First, I check if the sentence is a grammatically correct English sentence. The sentence is \"Everything went according to the plan.\" which appears to be grammatically correct as it has a subject \"Everything\", a verb \"went\", and additional parts making it a complete sentence. The sentence also ends with a punctuation mark, which is acceptable as per the specification.\n\n- Next, I verify if the word \"according\" is present within the sentence. The sentence does indeed contain the word \"according\".\n\n- I proceed to ensure that the word is not an empty string, which \"according\" clearly is not.\n\n- Finally, I check to ensure the word does not include any punctuation, and in this input, it does not.\n\nWith the sentence being grammatically correct, including the specified word within it, and both the sentence and word satisfying criteria related to being non-empty and format, the provided input aligns fully with the input specification.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output is \"Preposition\". According to the task description, the chatbot should return only a part-of-speech tag from a provided list, which consists of abbreviations such as NN, VB, JJ, etc. \"Preposition\" is not one of these listed tags; instead, the expected tag for a preposition according to the description should be \"IN\" for preposition or subordinating conjunction. Hence, the output does not comply with the requirement to return a tag from the specific list, as it provides a full word instead of the abbreviated tag.\n\nERR",
