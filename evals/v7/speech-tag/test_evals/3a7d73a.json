The proper nouns or less common words are still valid within a grammatically correct structure. \n\nNext, I will check if the word \"zzyzx\" is present in the sentence. The word \"zzyzx\" is indeed present in the sentence \"Welcome to zzyzx road.\" \n\nAdditionally, I will verify that neither the sentence nor the word is an empty string. Both conditions are satisfied as neither the sentence nor the word is empty.\n\nI must also check the word against the restriction that it must not include punctuation signsâ€”\"zzyzx\" does not include any punctuation signs.\n\nAll elements of the input comply with the input specification.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The output \"Unknown\" is compliant with the chatbot description.
