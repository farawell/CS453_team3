  "validityText": "The sentence given is \"This sentence cannot be processed.\" which is a grammatically correct English sentence that includes punctuation. The word provided is \"unprocesable.\" According to the input specification, the word must be present within the sentence provided. Upon inspecting the sentence, the word \"unprocesable\" is not found within it. Additionally, the word must not include punctuation signs, which the provided word does not. However, the key rule of the word being part of the sentence is violated here. Thus, based on this specific violation where the word isn't present in the sentence, the input does not comply with the input specification.\n\nERR",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output is \"Unknown\", which is a valid response according to the description. \"Unknown\" is listed as the output to return if the word cannot be tagged with the specified tags. Since the description specifies outputs \"Unknown\" and \"CantAnswer\" for situations where a tag cannot be determined, and given I do not have the specific sentence or word to evaluate correctness, this output complies with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
