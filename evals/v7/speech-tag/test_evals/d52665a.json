  "validityText": "The input includes a sentence \"Eagerly awaited.\" and a word \"awaited\".\n\n1. Checking if the sentence is a grammatically correct English sentence: The sentence \"Eagerly awaited.\" seems incomplete, as it lacks a subject. In English grammar, a sentence should typically contain a subject and a predicate. Here, \"Eagerly awaited.\" appears as a fragment rather than a complete sentence.\n\n2. The word \"awaited\" is present in the sentence \"Eagerly awaited.\" which complies with the requirement that the word must be present within the sentence.\n\n3. The word \"awaited\" is not an empty string.\n\n4. The sentence \"Eagerly awaited.\" is not an empty string.\n\n5. The sentence may include punctuation (in this case, a period at the end), which is allowed according to the specification.\n\n6. The word \"awaited\" does not include punctuation signs, complying with the specification.\n\nDespite the presence of the word within the sentence and the fact that neither the word nor the sentence is empty, the primary issue is that the sentence \"Eagerly awaited.\" does not qualify as a grammatically correct English sentence as it is missing a subject.\n\nBased on the inspection of the input and adherence to the input specification, the sentence does not comply because it is not a complete grammatical sentence. \n\nERR",

According to the description, the output should be a specific part-of-speech tag from the provided list (e.g., VB for Verb, base form, VBD for Verb, past tense, etc.). \"Verb\" is not one of the listed tags, and it does not conform to the format required by the description, which is to return just the tag. Therefore, this is a violation of the description.\n\nERR",
