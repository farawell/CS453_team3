  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output \"Adjective\" does not comply with the description provided. According to the description, the chatbot is required to return only the part of speech tag, not the full word form of the part of speech. The valid tags are provided in the description, such as \"JJ\" for Adjective, along with other tags. Since \"Adjective\" is not one of the listed tags, it violates the guideline that specifies returning only the tag. Thus, the output should have been the specific tag \"JJ\" if that was relevant, rather than the word \"Adjective.\"\n\nERR",
