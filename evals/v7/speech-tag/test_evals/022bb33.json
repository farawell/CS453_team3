  "validityText": "The input specification requires a sentence and a word from that sentence. \n\nFirst, I will examine the sentence. The sentence provided is \"Freshly baked cookies.\" The specification states the sentence must be a grammatically correct English sentence and may include punctuation. \"Freshly baked cookies.\" is a grammatically correct sentence, especially if interpreted as a noun phrase with implicit understanding, often common in informal contexts.\n\nNext, I will examine the word provided. The word is \"baked\". The specification requires this word to be present within the sentence. The word \"baked\" is indeed present within the sentence. The word must not include punctuation signs, and \"baked\" does not contain any punctuation.\n\nBased on the input specification: \n- The sentence must be grammatically correct (complied since informal interpretations are allowed).\n- The word must be in the sentence and have no punctuation (complied).\n\nNo violations of the input specification were found in this input.\n\nOK",
