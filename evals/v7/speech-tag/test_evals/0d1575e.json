  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output provides the word \"Modal.\" According to the description, the chatbot is supposed to return the part of speech tag and not the full form or explanation of the part of speech. In the given list of part-of-speech tags, \"MD\" is used to represent a modal verb. Therefore, the output should have been \"MD\" rather than \"Modal.\" The chatbot failed to comply by not returning the specified part-of-speech tag from the list; hence, it violates the requirement to return only the tag.\n\nThe violation is that the output is \"Modal\" instead of the expected tag \"MD\" as per the task description.\n\nERR",
