Upon analyzing the provided input, it is clear that the input only includes a sentence: \"There are many colours in this art.\" \n\nLet's evaluate the input based on the provided input specifications:\n\n1. The sentence \"There are many colours in this art.\" is a grammatically correct English sentence.\n2. However, the input does not specify a separate word from the sentence.\n3. According to the specification, \"The sentence and one word from that sentence\" need to be provided, explicitly indicating two distinct components.\n4. Also, there is no indication or separation in the input to identify which word from the sentence is intended to be specified separately.\n\nTherefore, the input violates the specification because it lacks a clearly specified word from the sentence.\n\nERR",
