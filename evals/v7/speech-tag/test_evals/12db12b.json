  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence and a word from that sentence.\n\n1. **Sentence Compliance**:\n   - The sentence provided is: \"I coined murf the word.\"\n   - Analyzing its grammar: \"I\" is the subject, \"coined\" is the verb, and \"murf the word\" functions as the object. The sentence structure is correct, though somewhat unusual, as \"murf the word\" is non-standard language usage. However, it is grammatically structured and coherent for purposes of this assessment.\n   - The sentence is not empty, thus complying with the rule that it must not be an empty string.\n   - Punctuation is present (a period), which is allowed as the specification states that the sentence may include punctuation.\n\n2. **Word Compliance**:\n   - The word provided is: \"murf\".\n   - Checking presence in the sentence: The word \"murf\" is indeed present within the sentence.\n   - The word is not an empty string.\n   - There is no punctuation in the word itself, fulfilling the requirement that the word must not include punctuation signs.\n\nBased on the input specification, both the sentence and the word meet all outlined criteria. The sentence is grammatically correct and non-empty, and the word \"murf\" is present in the sentence, non-empty, and free from punctuation. Therefore, the input complies with the provided specifications.\n\nOK",
