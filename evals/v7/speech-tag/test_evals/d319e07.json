According to the input specification, the input must include both a sentence and a word from that sentence. Additionally, the word must not be an empty string.

According to the task description, the chatbot should return \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with one of the listed part-of-speech tags. Since I am not given the input, I cannot evaluate whether the word actually cannot be tagged, and so I must focus solely on the compliance aspect. The chatbot's output is formatted correctly, as it does return exactly \"Unknown\" as specified by the guidelines.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
