  "validityText": "The input consists of two parts: a sentence and a word. The sentence provided is \"The unexplained phenomenon.\" The word specified is \"unexplained\".\n\nAccording to the input specification, I need to check the following:\n\n1. **Sentence compliance**: The sentence must be a grammatically correct English sentence. \"The unexplained phenomenon.\" appears to be grammatically correct, as it has a definite article \"The\", followed by an adjective \"unexplained\", and a noun \"phenomenon\", with a period at the end. This forms a complete sentence in English, describing a phenomenon that is not explained.\n\n2. **Word compliance**: The word must be present in the sentence and must not include punctuation signs. The word \"unexplained\" is indeed present in the sentence and does not include any punctuation.\n\n3. **Non-empty checks**: Both the sentence and the word must not be empty strings. The sentence \"The unexplained phenomenon.\" is not empty, and the word \"unexplained\" is also not an empty string.\n\nSince the input satisfies all the criteria outlined in the specification, there is no violation.\n\nOK",

Hence, this does not comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR",
