  "validityText": "The given input consists of a sentence: \"My non-conclusive sentence.\" and a word: \"non-conclusive\". \n\n1. Evaluating the Sentence:\n   - The sentence \"My non-conclusive sentence.\" is a grammatically correct English sentence. \n   - There's no indication of an empty string for the sentence.\n   - The sentence includes punctuation, which is allowable per the specification.\n\n2. Evaluating the Word:\n   - The specified word is \"non-conclusive\".\n   - The word is found in the given sentence.\n   - The word is not an empty string.\n   - The specification indicates that the word must not include punctuation signs. In this case, \"non-conclusive\" includes a hyphen ('-'), which is a punctuation sign. \n\nBased on the specification, the word having a punctuation mark ('-') constitutes a violation as the specification explicitly states that the word must not include punctuation signs. Therefore, the input does not comply with the input specification due to the hyphen in \"non-conclusive\". \n\nERR",
