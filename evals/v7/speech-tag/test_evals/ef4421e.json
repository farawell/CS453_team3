  "validityText": "Upon examining the input, here are the observations made with respect to the input specifications:\n\n1. **Sentence Compliance**: \n   - The sentence provided is \"My entirely customized interface.W\". It appears to be a grammatically incorrect sentence due to the lack of space after the period before \"W\". This punctuation error can disrupt the reading and comprehension of the sentence, which violates the requirement for the sentence being a grammatically correct English sentence.\n\n2. **Word Presence and Format**:\n   - The word provided is \"entirely\".\n   - The word \"entirely\" is present within the sentence \"My entirely customized interface.W\".\n   - The word \"entirely\" does not include any punctuation, which complies with the specification.\n   \n3. **Empty String Checks**:\n   - Neither the sentence nor the word is an empty string.\n\nBased on the evaluation above, the main issue is the grammatical incorrectness of the sentence due to punctuation spacing, leading to non-compliance with the specification that mandates a grammatically correct sentence.\n\nERR",
