  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence and a word. The sentence provided is \"The session was remarkable.\" This sentence is a grammatically correct English sentence and may include punctuation, as allowed by the input specification. However, the word given is \"sessione\". According to the input specification, the word must be present within the sentence provided. Upon examining the sentence, the word \"sessione\" does not appear in it (the word \"session\" appears, but is not the same as \"sessione\"). Thus, the input does not comply with the input specification because the word specified is not present within the sentence. \n\nERR",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output is \"Unknown.\" According to the description, if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, the chatbot should return \"Unknown.\" There are no other elements or text in the output that violate the rules of being direct and explicit as per the description. The single word \"Unknown\" aligns with the directive for returning this term if the word cannot be matched with the given part-of-speech tags. Hence, the output complies with the provided chatbot description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
