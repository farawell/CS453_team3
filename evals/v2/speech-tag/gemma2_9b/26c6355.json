The description allows for an output that is a single part-of-speech tag from the provided list. Since \"NN\" corresponds to \"Noun, singular or mass,\" it is compliant with the requirement to return just the tag for the word's part of speech, without requiring knowledge of the inputs provided to the chatbot.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
