The guidelines dictate that the response should be just the tag for the word's part of speech or one of the specified outputs if unable to tagâ€”\"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\". Since \"NN\" is an acceptable part of speech tag, the output complies with the description. No additional context or validity check on the tag's correctness relative to the input sentence is required, as per the instructions, since the input is not provided to us. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
