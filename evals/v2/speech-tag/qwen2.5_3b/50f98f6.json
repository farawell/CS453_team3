According to the description, the valid part of speech tag for a verb in base form is \"VB\". The additional character \"\\uFE0F\" indicates VARIATION SELECTOR-16, which is not part of the prescribed format. The output should strictly conform to the specified part of speech tags without incorporating any extraneous characters or emojis. As such, the output does not comply with the requirement to return only the tag.\n\nThe violation occurred because the output included an extra character in addition to the tag, which is contradictory to the guidelines that specify returning just the tag.\n\nERR"
