The description allows for \"Unknown\" as a valid response under these circumstances. The output is one of the specified options and fits within the bounds of what the task demands. Without knowing the input, I cannot determine if \"Unknown\" is the correct response, but the output format directly complies with the permitted responses in the task description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
