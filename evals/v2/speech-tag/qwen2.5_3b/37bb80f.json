  "evaluation": "The task for the chatbot is to determine the part of speech for a given word and return just the tag for the word's part of speech. The description specifies that the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag. In this case, the chatbot's output is \"WP: Wh-pronoun,\" which includes additional information (\"Wh-pronoun\") instead of returning just the tag (\"WP\"). According to the guidelines, the tag should be given without any additional labels or explanations.\n\nThe actual requirement is to return the tag alone, not the tag combined with its definition or descriptor. This inclusion of the full description alongside the tag is a violation.\n\nERR"
