The output provided by the chatbot is a part-of-speech tag, and it does not include anything more than that, such as examples or explanations, which complies with the requirement to return only the part-of-speech tag or the words \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\". Since the output does not violate the description by including irrelevant information or incorrect formatting, it complies with the requirements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
