The description requires at least three, so this requirement is satisfied.\n\n2. **Usage of <strong> tags**: Each <p> tag in the output contains one <strong> tag, as per the requirement to add a <strong> tag around a key word.\n\n3. **Usage of <em> tags**: Each <p> tag also contains multiple <em> tags, which is in compliance with the requirement to emphasize key words and phrases.\n\nGiven these observations, all the structural requirements of the description (i.e., number of <p> tags, inclusion of <strong> and <em> tags) are fulfilled by the provided output. The repetition of sentences within the output does not violate any stated requirement since the evaluation does not consider input-based correctness. Hence, overall, the output is compliant with the given description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
