Each paragraph also includes one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which aligns with the stipulation to emphasize key words and phrases within each `<p>` tag. \n\nSince there are no additional constraints on repeat sentences, the repetition of sentences wrapped in `<p>` tags does not violate any given guideline. Therefore, the output complies with all stated requirements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
