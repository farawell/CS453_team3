Each of these `<p>` tags contains a `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which aligns with the instruction to emphasize key words and phrases. The description requires at least three `<p>` tags, and this condition is satisfied as there are more than three `<p>` tags in the output. The presence of additional `<p>` tags is not against the description.\n\nSince the description's conditions on structuring and formatting have been met, the output complies with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
