  "evaluation": "The output contains only two `<p>` tags even though the description requires at least three `<p>` tags. Also, there are multiple sentences within each `<p>` tag that are not separated into individual tags as instructed in the description. Each sentence should be wrapped in its own `<p>` tag. Additionally, the use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag is minimal, with only one instance of `<em>` being used, indicating non-compliance with the requirement to add multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases within each `<p>`. Therefore, the output does not comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
