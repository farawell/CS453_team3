  "evaluation": "The evaluation of the output involves checking for the following compliance criteria based on the description:\n\n1. The output should contain at least three `<p>` tags. This output has three `<p>` tags:\n   - `<p><strong>Beaches</strong> are <em>relaxing.</em></p>`\n   - `<p><strong>Sunsets</strong> are <em>beautiful.</em></p>`\n   - `<p>The sound of waves is <em>calming.</em></p>`\n\n2. Each `<p>` tag should contain one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags.\n   - The first `<p>` tag has one `<strong>` tag and one `<em>` tag.\n   - The second `<p>` tag has one `<strong>` tag and one `<em>` tag.\n   - The third `<p>` tag has no `<strong>` tag but has one `<em>` tag.\n\nThe output does not strictly comply because the third `<p>` tag does not include a `<strong>` tag, which is a requirement per the description. Each sentence should include a `<strong>` tag to emphasize suitable keywords or phrases.\n\nExplanation:\n- To comply, all `<p>` tags should contain one `<strong>` tag, but the third tag (\"The sound of waves is <em>calming.</em>\") does not.\n\nERR"
