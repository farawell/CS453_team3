The output should have at least three `<p>` tags.\n\n1. **Check the number of `<p>` tags**: The output has three `<p>` tags, which fulfills the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n   \n2. **Check for `<strong>` and `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag**:\n   - In the first `<p>` tag: There is one `<strong>` tag correctly used around an `<em>` tag.\n   - In the second `<p>` tag: There is the presence of a `<strong>` tag which correctly incorporates an `<em>` tag.\n   - In the third `<p>` tag: There are `<strong>` and `<em>` tags present, but it contains multiple sentences within a single `<p>` tag which indicates improper tagging according to the requirement.\n\nThe main issue is that the third `<p>` tag improperly contains multiple sentences, violating the requirement that each sentence must be in its own `<p>` tag.\n\nDue to the non-compliance with the rule of having separate `<p>` tags for each sentence, the output does not fully comply with the given description.\n\nERR"
