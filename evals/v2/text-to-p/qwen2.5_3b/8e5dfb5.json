The first and third `<p>` tags only have one `<em>` tag, which does not follow the guideline stating that multiple `<em>` tags should be included in each `<p>` tag.\n\nReasons for violation:\n- The first `<p>` tag contains only one `<em>` tag instead of multiple.\n- The third `<p>` tag also contains only one `<em>` tag.\n\nGiven these considerations, the output does not meet the described requirements.\n\nERR"
