The output is divided into the four required categories: \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" The format uses a comma-separated list for \"Company names,\" which is compliant even though there is only one company name listed. The \"People names\" section uses the placeholder \"-||-\" as required, indicating no content was extracted or that it aligns with the expected format when there are no people names. The other categories also follow the format correctly with comma-separated lists.\n\nNo parts of the output indicate any violation of the format or structure specified in the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
