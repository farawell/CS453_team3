The output is expected to follow the structure:\n\nCompany names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\nPeople names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\nSpecific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\nGeneral themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n\nThe given output is:\n\n1. **Company names**: The placeholder `-||-` is not provided, which may suggest an omission or formatting inconsistency because according to the desired format, a placeholder should be used if there are no elements to list.\n   \n2. **People names**: The placeholder `-||-` is correctly used, indicating no people names were extracted. \n\n3. **Specific topics**: These are provided as \"trade, partnerships, international relations,\" and are in a comma-separated list as required.\n\n4. **General themes**: These are listed as \"economic cooperation, globalization, trade development,\" and again, are provided as a comma-separated list as required.\n\nThe problem lies in the \"Company names\" section. It is inconsistent because:\n\n- The output does not use the `-||-` placeholder for \"Company names,\" which is inconsistent with how the other sections are handled.\n\nTherefore, based on the inconsistency in formatting for \"Company names,\" I conclude that the output does not fully comply with the description's requirement regarding formatting.\n\nViolation: The \"Company names\" section does not use the placeholder `-||-`, leading to a lack of consistency in the formatting rule where no elements are found.\n\nERR"
