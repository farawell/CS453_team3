The company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes are each presented as comma-separated lists as requested. \n\nThere are no evident formatting violations. However, without having the input text, I cannot verify the correctness of each category's content, but that is outside the scope of my evaluation. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
