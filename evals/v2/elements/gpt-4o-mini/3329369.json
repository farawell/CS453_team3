The \"Company names\" section should contain a comma-separated list of company names, but it is empty.\n2. The \"People names\" section should similarly contain names, and it currently uses the placeholder \"-||-\", which implies that no processing was done to extract names. \n3. The format should adhere to extracting entities when possible, even if empty. The placeholder \"-||-\" is used inappropriately here in both \"Company names\" and \"People names\", and it leaves ambiguity. An explicit indication of \"None\" or a clearly marked empty list without placeholders would have been more appropriate if applicable.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
