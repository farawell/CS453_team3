  "evaluation": "The format of the output complies with the desired format as described in the chatbot's description. The output is organized according to the specified categories: \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes,\" each followed by content, even though the \"People names\" section is empty. The use of \"-||-\" as a placeholder suggests there were no entries to extract, which aligns with how the format intends to handle categories with no information. The separation of sections and listing aligns with the requested structure.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
