  "evaluation": "The chatbot output is required to follow a specific format according to the description: \n\n1. Company names should be a \"comma_separated_list_of_company_names\".\n2. People names should also be in the same comma-separated format.\n3. The output should include all specified sections: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes.\n\nEvaluation:\n\n- The \"Company names\" section is empty, which does not comply with the format requirement of listing \"company names\" as if it does not extract any names, it should explicitly state \"None\" or similar wording rather than leaving it blank.\n  \n- The \"People names\" section contains \"Sergey Brin\", which is presented correctly given it could potentially represent a comma-separated list.\n\n- The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections include items. The format for these sections appears to be followed correctly assuming these are comma-separated.\n\nHowever, the primary issue is with the \"Company names\" section being empty without specifying that no relevant data was found, thereby deviating from the expected output format.\n\nBased on these observations, there is a non-compliance with the specified format even without knowing the actual content of the input text, specifically regarding how an empty output should be formatted.\n\nERR"
