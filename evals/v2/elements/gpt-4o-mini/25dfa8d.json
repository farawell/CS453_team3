  "evaluation": "The chatbot output lists company names, specific topics, and general themes, following the format prescribed by the description. There is one notable compliance issue: the section for people names should be filled out, even if no people names are extracted (in which case it should include an explicit indication like \"None\" or \"N/A\", rather than using \"-||-\"). \n\nAnother point to consider is the compliance with the description which states, \"First extract all company names, then extract all people names...\". While this doesn't seem to have been violated per se (as company names are listed first), the placeholder used for people names (\"-||-\") is not aligned with the description's guidance. \n\nGiven this discrepancy, the output does not entirely comply with the description. \n\nERR"
