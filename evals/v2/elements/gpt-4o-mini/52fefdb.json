  "evaluation": "The chatbot output is missing some crucial elements, as described in the desired format. Specifically:\n\n- For \"Company names,\" it does not list anything or insert a placeholder. While it has a heading for \"Company names,\" it remains empty, which does not fit the expected format of a comma-separated list.\n- For \"People names,\" it correctly uses \"-||-\" to indicate no entries.\n- For \"Specific topics,\" it correctly uses \"-||-\" to indicate no entries.\n- For \"General themes,\" it provides \"revenue, sectors,\" which fits the expected comma-separated list format.\n\nGiven that the output does not fully comply with the format specified (particularly, the empty \"Company names\" section does not use the placeholder or provide a list), it violates the requirement.\n\nThe evaluation concludes that the output does not comply with the formatting requirements specified in the description.\n\nERR"
