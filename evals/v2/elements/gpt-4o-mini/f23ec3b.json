The expected format mentioned in the description requires a list of company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. In this output:\n\n1. **Company Names**: The section for company names exists but is empty. Without knowing whether there were any company names in the input text, we cannot determine compliance on this aspect.\n\n2. **People Names**: This section uses \"-||-\" to denote an empty list. This matches the format described.\n\n3. **Specific Topics**: The section lists specific topics as \"digitalization, big data, industry transformation,\" which fits the described structure of a comma-separated list.\n\n4. **General Themes**: The general themes are provided as \"technology, transformation, data analytics,\" following the expected format.\n\nIn terms of structure and adherence to the required output format (without input knowledge), the output complies with the expected format. There are no elements missing in terms of the required categories, and the format is correct.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
