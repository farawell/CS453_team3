The phrase should be followed by a comma or be alone. The use of '-||-' indicates an error in format here.\n\n4. **General themes** are correctly listed in a comma-separated format.\n\nBecause of the non-compliance in the \"Specific topics\" section, the output does not fully match the required format as specified in the description.\n\nERR"
