This does not contradict the format specified in the description since it's possible that no company names were in the supplied text.\n\n2. **People names**: The format for this section is correct as \"-||-\", which means no people names were found, and the section is correctly formatted according to the guidelines.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: This section is filled with \"Global security, EU policies, NATO policies\", which follows the comma-separated format required by the description.\n\n4. **General themes**: This section contains \"International relations, geopolitics\", which is consistent with the formatting expectations of comma-separated items.\n\nAll sections are present, and the provided output adheres to the specified format and guidelines, and there are no deviations in the structure or omissions based on the description.
