The list of people names is under \"People names\", again following the expected comma-separated format.\n3. \"Specific topics\" follows the same structure, with a comma-separated list of topics mentioned.\n4. \"General themes\" also follows this structure.\n\nThe structure and format for each section comply with the requirements, and there's no need for further input to determine the compliance of the format itself. Therefore, the output meets the description as per the evaluation guidelines.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
