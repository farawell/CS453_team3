This adherence to format is acceptable as it may be empty if no company names were detected, which cannot be verified without input text.\n   \n2. **People names**: Similarly, the output provides a placeholder for people names, but it is empty. Like company names, this is formatted correctly and may be valid depending on the input.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The output correctly lists \"Network Security\" as a specific topic, adhering to the format.\n\n4. **General themes**: The output lists \"Concerns, Cybersecurity,\" adhering to the format.\n\nThe overall structure of the output follows the prescribed format even though some entries are empty, which alone doesn't signify a compliance issue as that could be dependent on the input text. Since the correctness of extracted entities cannot be verified without the input, the evaluation should be based on format adherence alone. Therefore, there is no violation in the format or structure of the output.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
