The description requires the output to list company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes in a predefined format. The output provided is:\n\n- Company names: \n- People names: \n- Specific topics:  policies, strategies\n- General themes: change, policy shifts\n\nHowever, the format does not strictly comply because there are missing commas for \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" lists, where two items are presented but not comma-separated as \"<comma_separated_list_of_...>\" which violates the mandated format specified in the description. Due to this discrepancy in formatting compliance, the output is incorrect.\n\nERR"
