  "evaluation": "The chatbot output is evaluated as follows:\n\n1. **Company Names**: The output lists \"Facebook\" under company names in the expected format.\n2. **People Names**: The output lists no people names. While the compliance regarding the content requires input, the issue here is with formatting. It seems the bot may have overlooked using a placeholder like \"N/A\" or \"None\" as is commonly expected. However, this is not explicitly required in the description and does not constitute a direct non-compliance solely based on formatting requirements.\n3. **Specific Topics**: \"data privacy, debate\" are listed under specific topics, formatted correctly as comma-separated items.\n4. **General Themes**: \"social media responsibility, user protection\" are listed under general themes, formatted correctly as comma-separated items.\n\nThe output adheres to the overall format outlined in the chatbot's description. The potential concern of the \"People names\" section being empty does not directly conflict with the required format in the description provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
