Based on the instructions, the section should list any mentioned people names or explicitly indicate that there are none. As it stands, the section is incomplete or unclear compared to a section indicating \"None\" or similar. This discrepancy leads to non-compliance with the instruction format.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
