The correct format for the output requires each category to list the relevant extracted elements in a comma-separated format. However, the output for \"Company names\" and \"People names\" is shown as \"-||-\", which implies that no elements are extracted, suggesting either none were found or an incorrect format. The description does not specify using placeholders like \"-||-\" as valid substitutes. Consequently, the output does not strictly comply with the format requirement of the description.\n\nERR"
