  "output": "Company names: IBM\nPeople names: Arvind Krishna \nSpecific topics: annual reports,  CEOs\nGeneral themes: business presentations, leadership. \n\n\n",
  "evaluation": "The chatbot output follows the format specified in the description: \n\n1. **Company names** are listed first, although they are in a single-item format rather than a comma-separated list. However, since there is only one company listed, this satisfies the condition.\n\n2. **People names** are listed next. The name 'Arvind Krishna' is presented, which follows the format - again, it appears as a single-item list due to only having one name which is acceptable.\n\n3. **Specific topics** are presented next, following the format and listing separate topics.\n\n4. **General themes** are also correctly formatted and listed at the end.\n\nThe chatbot's output is structured precisely according to the desired format specified in the description. Every category is presented in order, even if each category only contains a single item. Hence, there are no violations in the output format as required by the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
