  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output generally adheres to the desired format outlined in the description. It presents lists for Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. However, there is a clear discrepancy between the formatting expectations:\n\n1. **Company names and People names**: Instead of presenting these lists as comma_separated_list_of_company_names or similar for people names, the chatbot uses \"-||-\", which does not comply with the expected format.\n\nThe output contains the following issues:\n- The 'Company names' and 'People names' sections are not formatted as expected; they use \"-||-\" instead of an empty or a properly comma-separated list.\n\nTherefore, based on the expectation that tags should be formatted in a certain way (even if empty), and as the output doesnâ€™t adhere to these expectations, it does not fully comply with the description.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
