Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n2. People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\n3. Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\n4. General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n\nIn examining the given output:\n\n- The \"Company names\" section is empty. While we can't determine correctness without the input, the structure is maintained. \n- The \"People names\" section contains \"Bill Gates, Steve Jobs,\" which is correctly formatted.\n- The \"Specific topics\" section includes \"modern computing, legacies,\" which fits the required format.\n- The \"General themes\" section contains \"innovation, influence,\" correctly following the specified structure.\n\nOverall, the output follows the desired structure laid out in the description. There is no explicit requirement in the description for content in every section, just compliance with the output format. Therefore, nothing in the output violates the structural compliance guidelines given.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
