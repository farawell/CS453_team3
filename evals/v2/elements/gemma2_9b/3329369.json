The expected format includes sections for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. Even if no entities or topics are extracted due to the nature of the provided text, these sections should still be presented in the response.\n\nIn this output, the chatbot does not explicitly follow the described format. It does not list \"Company names:\", \"People names:\", or \"Specific topics:\", even if they are empty, which is necessary to comply with the required structure. The output jumps directly into the explanation and only includes \"General themes:\" without maintaining consistency with the expected format. The described format is not followed, which constitutes a non-compliance with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
