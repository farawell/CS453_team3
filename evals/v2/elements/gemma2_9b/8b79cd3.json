  "evaluation": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description provided for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Format Compliance**: The format for the entities list is not exactly as specified in the desired format. While the word \"General themes\" uses a colon as specified, the other categories use double pipes (\"-||-\") after the colon instead of after the list, which doesn't align with the desired format.\n\n2. **Missing List Delimiters**: There should be a comma-separated list for each category of entities. However, the output presents \"-||-\" for both company names and people names, which does not match the instructed format.\n\nIn both cases, the output carries the implication of an empty list but does not adhere to the specific requirement of showing elements in a comma-separated list form as the description implies by example.\n\nBased on these observations, the output does not strictly follow the stipulated desired format for extracts as described.\n\nERR"
