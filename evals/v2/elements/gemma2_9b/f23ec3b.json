  "evaluation": "The chatbot output appears not to comply with the description provided for several reasons. Firstly, the \"Company names\" field is left completely empty, which does not follow the format of providing a comma-separated list, or indicating if no company names are present. Secondly, for \"People names,\" instead of a consideration for absence or presence of names, \"-||-\" is inserted, which does not adhere to the description's structure, which requires providing a comma-separated list or indicating absence appropriately. Lastly, there is a closing line \"Let me know if you want me to process another piece of text!\" which is not mentioned in the desired format specified in the description.\n\nERR"
