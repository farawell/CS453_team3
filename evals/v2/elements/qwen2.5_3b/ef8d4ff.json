  "evaluation": "The output needs to comply with the format required by the description which involves providing comma-separated lists and using '-||-' for categories with no extractions. The issue is with the \"Company names\" field in the output. According to the desired format, if a category doesn't have any extracted elements, it should be represented with '-||-'. However, the \"Company names\" field is left empty instead of showing '-||-', which represents that no companies were extracted. \n\nThis leads to a non-compliance issue as the output does not align perfectly with the desired format specified in the description.\n\nMy evaluation is that the output does not perfectly comply with the chatbot description format, specifically for the \"Company names\" field. \n\nERR"
