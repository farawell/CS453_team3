  "input": "Mark Zuckerberg visited Facebook's headquarters to discuss digital innovation and met with Tim Cook from Apple.",
  "output": "Company names: Facebook, Apple\nPeople names: -||-\nSpecific topics: Digital Innovation, Meeting between Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook\nGeneral themes: Leadership, Innovation in technology companies, Industry Collaboration, Business Meetings",
  "evaluation": "The given output generally adheres to the format specified in the description. However, there is a notable deviation in the formatting of the \"People names\" section. Instead of providing a comma-separated list of people's names, it uses the symbol \"-||-\". This format is not consistent with the instruction to use a comma-separated list. The rest of the sections follow the expected format and structure. Based on this observation, I conclude that the output does not fully comply with the description.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
