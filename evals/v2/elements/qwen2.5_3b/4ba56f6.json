  "evaluation": "The evaluation process begins by comparing the output against the desired format, which should include four categories: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. Each category should list items separated by commas.\n\n1. **Company names**: The output should list company names in a comma-separated format following \"Company names:\". In the provided output, this section is present but no company names are mentioned after the colon. \n\n2. **People names**: The output should list people names in a comma-separated format following \"People names:-||-\". The output correctly uses the placeholder \"-||-\", indicating no people names are extracted or available.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The \"Specific topics:\" section in the output lists \"AI trends\", which is correctly following the format expectation. It appears in the correct position according to the desired format.\n\n4. **General themes**: The \"General themes:\" section is followed by \"Technology, Innovation\", a comma-separated list, which complies with the formatting rule.\n\nWhile there is a potential issue with the \"Company names\" section being empty, without explicitly knowing if there was any company name to list, this compliance cannot be determined. Given there is nothing that could be checked without knowing the input, I return 'OK'. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
