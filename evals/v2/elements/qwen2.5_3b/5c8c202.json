  "evaluation": "The chatbot output is structured according to the desired format specified in the chatbot description, which includes sections for \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" Even though the 'People names' field is empty, having no extracted entities in that category does not necessarily constitute a non-compliance, as it may simply indicate that no relevant people names were present in the text. The output follows the format with comma-separated lists where appropriate, which aligns with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
