  "evaluation": "The chatbot output provides lists as requested: \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\". However, under \"People names\", it uses \"-||-\" instead of listing no names at all, which is consistent considering there might not be any people names extracted. However, the usage of \"-||-\" for \"People names\" does not show the intent of \"a comma-separated list\" as mentioned in the description. Hence it doesn't look much of a violation though. The specific topics include \"Google\", which is a company name and shouldn't be listed as a specific topic. Therefore, the output does not completely follow the format as prescribed in the chatbot's description.\n\nViolation: Incorrect categorization of \"Google\" under Specific topics and lack of adherence to the list format for \"People names\"\n\nERR"
