  "evaluation": "The chatbot output is mostly formatted according to the specification described. It lists extracted elements in separate categories: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. Each category is prefixed appropriately.\n\nHowever, there is a minor inconsistency in the \"People names\" category. It is not entirely empty but uses the placeholder \"-||-\" which, according to the desired format, should represent a list of names if they exist. If no people names are present, a clearer indication with no content (i.e., remaining unlisted or explicitly mentioned as none) would have been more consistent with proper representation.\n\nDespite this discrepancy, it does not strictly violate the given format specification based on known information, as the placeholder implies no names found, which could be appropriate depending on input.\n\nConsidering that there is no explicit violation based on the provided format and description, and since the aspects requiring input to verify are not considered for checking after evaluation:\n\nOK"
