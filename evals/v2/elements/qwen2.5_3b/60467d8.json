The format requires separate and clear headings for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes, with each category populated accordingly.\n\n1. **Company Names**: The output correctly lists \"Amazon\" under company names.\n2. **People Names**: It lists \"-||-\" which appears to follow the format for when there are no entities to list.\n3. **Specific Topics**: The entry includes \"Jeff Bezos\" here, which should be under \"People names.\" This indicates a formatting issue as per the description, there's a category specifically for people names.\n4. **General Themes**: Contains appropriate themes like \"leadership, industry impact, technology advancement.\"\n\nThere is one compliance issue: \"Jeff Bezos\" should be listed under \"People names\" rather than \"Specific topics.\" \n\nTherefore, the violation is due to incorrect categorization of the name \"Jeff Bezos.\"\n\nERR"
