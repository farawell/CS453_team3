  "evaluation": "The chatbot output does not comply with the desired format specified in the description. The description specifies that the \"Company names\" and \"People names\" fields should have \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" and \"<comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\" respectively. However, in the output, \"Company names\" is left empty without any indicator that no companies were mentioned. Furthermore, for the field \"People names,\" the placeholder \"-||-\" is used, which matches the format description, indicating no people names were mentioned. \n\nMoreover, \"Specific topics\" has a typo in \"innovation,\" which is incorrectly split as \"innovat ion.\" This does not match the expected format where topics should be clearly listed without typos, and in a comma-separated list.\n\nBesides these points, both \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" are provided as lists according to the format. However, due to the typo present in \"Specific topics,\" the output does not fully comply with the specified format.\n\nBased on the violations identified, the output does not adhere to the described format.\n\nERR"
