  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output is almost fully compliant with the description, as it provides the required categories: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, there is an inconsistency in the presentation of \"People names,\" which should be presented in the format of a comma-separated list, or indicate none in a manner consistent with the template, rather than using \"-||-\". Although the intent is clear, the prompt appears to imply a need for consistent format across all categories.\n\nReason for violation: The \"People names\" section does not contain a list or explicitly indicate the lack of items in a consistent manner; instead, it uses \"-||-\", which is not necessarily consistent with naming formats if it means 'none' or no output needed.\n\nERR"
