  "input": "Cybersecurity was a key discussion topic at the G7 summit.",
  "output": "Company names: \nPeople names: -||-\nSpecific topics: cybersecurity, G7 summit\nGeneral themes: security, global summit discussions",
  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output should list company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes in a structured format. The compliance of this output with the description can be evaluated as follows:\n\n1. **Company Names**: The output does not include any company names but does leave a line for them. The lack of company names means it isn't fully populating this section, but without knowing if there were company names in the input, this can't be definitively marked non-compliant.\n   \n2. **People Names**: The output uses \"-||-\" to indicate this section and has not extracted any. This compliance is in line with the description if there are indeed no people names in the input text. \n\n3. **Specific Topics**: The output lists \"cybersecurity, G7 summit,\" which fits the requirement to extract specific topics.\n\n4. **General Themes**: The output lists \"security, global summit discussions,\" which aligns with extracting general overarching themes.\n\n5. **Format**: The output follows the desired format, using comma-separated lists and tagging each section properly.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, without the input, it's impossible to definitively say if omissions are warranted or if no such elements exist. However, each section is represented, including those with no content with the use of \"-||-\", maintaining structural compliance.\n\nNo apparent violations based solely on the structure and parts of output provided.\n\nOK",
