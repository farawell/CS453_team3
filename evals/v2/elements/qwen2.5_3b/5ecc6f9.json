  "evaluation": "The chatbot output is structured to comply with most of the desired format specified in the description. However, there is a deviation in the format for the \"People names\" section, where it uses \"-||-\" immediately after the colon instead of leaving it blank. The description specifies that these should be comma-separated lists. Instead, a hyphen followed by two vertical bars and another hyphen is used to indicate missing data for people names, which does not meet the format explicitly outlined in the description. \n\nViolation: The \"People names\" section should have been left empty, similar to the \"Company names\" field, when there is no data to report, rather than using the \"-||-\" notation.\n\nERR"
