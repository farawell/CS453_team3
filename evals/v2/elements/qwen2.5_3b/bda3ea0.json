  "evaluation": "The chatbot output structure partly follows the format described in the chatbot description. The issues found are as follows:\n\n1. The section for \"Company names\" is empty. While this might align with the input text not having company names, there is no explicit compliance failure here since the section is present.\n\n2. The \"People names\" section is marked as \"-||-\", which is correct when no information is available. However, the presence of Angela Merkel and Nelson Mandela in the \"Specific topics\" section suggests that these names should have been identified and placed in the \"People names\" section instead.\n\nGiven these observations, there is a violation of the format requirements where \"People names\" were extracted or omitted incorrectly based on the available information in the \"Specific topics.\"\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
