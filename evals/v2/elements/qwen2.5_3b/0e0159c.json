  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output needs to follow a specific format described in the description: it should list company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes extracted from the given text. According to that format, the output should use \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\", \"<comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\", \"<comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\", and \"<comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\". The provided output fails to use this format for company names, listing them as empty without a comma-separated list format, and there is no explicit indication that lists of people names and company names are presented as \"<comma_separated_list>\", not even with placeholders. It also includes an incorrect placeholder \"-||-\" for people names, which does not comply with the description. Considering these format issues, the output does not entirely comply with the chatbot description.\n\nViolation:\n- The \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections lack a comma-separated list format, even if empty, and the placeholder used for \"People names\" is incorrect.\n\nERR"
