The output is expected to list elements in a specific order: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes, all formatted with \"<comma_separated_list>\". \n\nHere's the specific issue:\n- For 'Company names', the output provides a blank result without even the placeholder '-||-'. This suggests an incomplete extraction instead of confirming the absence of company names when using the '-||-'.\n- For 'General themes', the output correctly lists a theme: \"managing and enhancing network security\".\n- Both 'People names' and 'Specific topics' correctly use the placeholder '-||-' indicating either no extraction was possible or there was nothing to extract for these categories.\n\nThe primary non-compliance issue is the lack of a properly formatted entry (e.g., '-||-') for 'Company names', which disrupts the expected uniformity and consistency as outlined in the desired output format in the description.\n\nThe violation is due to incorrect formatting for 'Company names'.\n\nERR"
