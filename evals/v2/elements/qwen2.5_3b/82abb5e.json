  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output is structured to extract and list elements as per the desired format in the description. The description specifies that the output should contain four fields: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. \n\nHowever, in the provided output, the \"Company names\" field is empty, represented by \"Company names:\". According to the description, the expected format is \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\". The output should either have a placeholder indicating no company names were extracted (like \"-||-\" for people names), or better clarity on what is being conveyed. This discrepancy in representation constitutes a violation of the expected format.\n\nTherefore, the output does not fully comply with the description provided.\n\nThe violation is related to the lack of clarity and consistency in how empty fields should be represented (as seen with \"Company names:\" being left empty without appropriate placeholders).\n\nERR"
