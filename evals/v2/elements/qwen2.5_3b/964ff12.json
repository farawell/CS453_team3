The output should look like:\n\n```\nCompany names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\nPeople names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\nSpecific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\nGeneral themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n```\n\nInstead, the output provided independently mentions that no companies or people are mentioned and separately states themes including Sergey Brin without following the intended format. The section for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes is not presented in the cohesive format as instructed, and there are inconsistencies in how the people names and themes are reported (Sergey Brin is mentioned in the context but not included explicitly in people names).\n\nMoreover, the term \"Company names: -||-\" appears twice, once with no following content, and a second unattached group of terms appears to be a mistake in presentation or organization, breaking the expected structure.\n\nBased on this, the output does not conform to the structure asked in the description.\n\nERR"
