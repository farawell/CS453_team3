  "evaluation": "The chatbot output generally follows the desired format. The output is structured correctly with lists for each category: \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" However, the \"People names\" category contains \"-||-\" which is the placeholder for \"comma_separated_list_of_people_names\". Since there can be instances where no people names are mentioned, this substitute is acceptable. Therefore, there are no explicit violations of the given instructions, and each category is addressed properly.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
