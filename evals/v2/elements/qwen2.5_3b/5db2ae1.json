The overarching theme focuses on how different industries coming together (cross-industry collaborations) is changing modern business practices.",
  "evaluation": "The chatbot output is structured according to the required format, listing company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, the 'Company names' and 'People names' sections are empty, represented correctly by placeholders. The note at the end explains the reasoning for this emptiness, which is appropriate if the input text did not contain any company or people names. The specific topics and general themes sections are filled with relevant items. The format matches the description's requirements in terms of section titles and placeholder usage, even without the input text for full verification.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
  "compliance": "ok"
