It separates the extracted categories clearly:\n\n1. **Company names**: Lists \"Amazon\" as a company name.\n2. **People names**: Uses the placeholder \"-||-\" which seems to indicate no people names were found.\n3. **Specific topics**: Lists \"logistics, expansions, firms\", which are specific yet require knowing the input to validate.\n4. **General themes**: Lists \"business planning, supply chain, partnerships\", fitting the requested format.\n\nThe output format precisely matches the structure delineated in the description. Each category is correctly labeled and separated, adhering to the desired format. I cannot assess whether the content is correct without the input, but the structure complies with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
