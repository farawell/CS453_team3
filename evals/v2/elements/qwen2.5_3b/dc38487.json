The format should clearly separate the four categories: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. Here are the issues with the chatbot output:\n\n1. The \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections are empty. The output should have a consistent format even if there are no entities to list. It is unclear if this format is correct as per the guidelines.\n   \n2. The sections are not separated by the \"-||-\" marker as indicated for consistency in the description. This marker should be used regardless of whether there are items to list or not to ensure uniformity in the output format.\n\n3. There is an inconsistency with the use of the \"-||-\" marker in the output. The marker is used after \"People names,\" but it is not used after \"Specific topics,\" which is required by the given format in the description.\n\nDue to the inconsistencies with the format and unclear adherence to the guidelines for sections with missing content, the output does not fully comply with the described format requirements.\n\nERR"
