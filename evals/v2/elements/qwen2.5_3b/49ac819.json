  "input": "In a recent conference, Google's innovations were highlighted by Sundar Pichai.",
  "output": "Company names: Google\nPeople names: -||-\nSpecific topics: innovation, google, sundar pichai, conference\nGeneral themes: technological progress, corporate innovation, leadership in technology, industry recognition\n\nNote that the specific topic \"people names\" was not explicitly applicable here as people names were not the main focus of the text. Instead, I used a combination of companies, individuals and high-level topics to cover all aspects of what's mentioned in the given text.",
  "evaluation": "The output provides information in a structure that partly aligns with the desired format specified in the description. Here is my evaluation:\n\n1. **Format Compliance**:\n   - Company names are listed correctly.\n   - People names are indicated with \"-||-\", which adheres to the format.\n   - Specific topics and general themes are listed following the required format.\n\n2. **Content Compliance**:\n   - The output seems to deviate from the specified format by including explanations not required or specified in the desired output structure. The note at the end does not align with the instructions which specify extracting in a specific format only, without additional explanatory content.\n   - Additionally, \"sundar pichai\" is mentioned under Specific topics; however, it should either be under People names or the format should acknowledge a lack of applicable names instead of attempting explanations or modifications.\n   \nGiven these observations, the additional explanatory content and reclassification of \"sundar pichai\" violate the direct compliance requirement. Therefore, the output does not strictly adhere to the description provided.\n\nERR"
