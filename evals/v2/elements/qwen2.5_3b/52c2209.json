According to the description, the output should have each category filled out, even if it is to indicate no entries were found with something like an empty list. The \"Company names\" field is left entirely blank without indicating there are no company names. Additionally, while \"People names\" uses the placeholder \"-||-\", it might not be clear if that indicates no names were found or it is a mistake. To enhance clarity, it should consistently either be left blank similarly across all categories or indicate intentionally that there are no entries found. \n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
