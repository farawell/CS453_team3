Specifically, it should have split the paragraph into sentences and enclosed each sentence in `<p>` tags. Then, within each `<p>`, at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags should have been used to highlight key words and phrases. Since the output did not show any such formatting and directly repeated part of the guidelines, it is non-compliant. \n\nERR"
