However, the description calls for each `<p>` tag to include one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. In the provided output, the `<strong>` tag is missing entirely, and the `<em>` tags are not used appropriately throughout all sentences, as they only appear in the last `<p>` tag and not around specific key words or phrases in each sentence.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
