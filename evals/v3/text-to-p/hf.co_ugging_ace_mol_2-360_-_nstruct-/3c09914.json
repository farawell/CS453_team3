There are no `<p>` tags present.\n2. There are no `<strong>` tags present.\n3. There are no `<em>` tags present.\n\nBased on these observations, the output does not comply with the chatbot description, which clearly requires the presence of these HTML tags. Since multiple required elements are missing, the output is not formatted correctly according to the instructions provided.\n\nERR"
