As you walk along a beautiful beach, notice how tall the mountains rise up against the sky and stretch in every direction.\nIf this sea breeze helps your skin sweat on a lovely day during summer, don't forget to apply sunscreen after walking around in these harsh weather conditions. If there happen to be more than one warm sand beach nearby it would help if you just went with what makes sense for that location as opposed to taking multiple long walks.",
