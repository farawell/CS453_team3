Rivers flow. Lakes settle. Oceans surge.\n2. Oceans surge. \n3. Oceans are large, immense bodies of water that exist on our planet and have a profound impact on the climate and the environment. Rivers flow across a vast area of land as well but their primary purpose is to carry the water from where it comes and transport it over long distances through rivers.\n2. Lakes settle. Wetlands cover around 40% of the earth's surface in oceans, lakes, wetlands, freshwater ponds that are formed by seasonal or drought-like conditions when rain or snowmelt flow into these pools without flowing fast to streams and creeks that do not have a lot of groundwater that enters them from underneath to cause flooding, with rainfall.\n3. Oceans surge. This is the name given to ocean water as it spreads over large areas of land at the mouths of long rivers. Rains bring lots of clean water on top of the ground when they hit dry riverbeds and drain into the sea at waterfalls or where their slopes meet the sea floor causing waves or flooding, with this type if water is from mountains instead of rivers that carry much more water than rain because the earth is covered with ice and snow.",
  "compliance": "err",
  "evaluation": "The chatbot output fails to comply with the given description due to several reasons:\n\n1. The output does not contain any HTML tags, whereas the description specifically instructs to format the input paragraph in HTML, wrapping each sentence with `<p>` tags, and within each `<p>` tag, including one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags.\n2. The output includes various sentences and structures that are not formatted as HTML, instead, it simply lists sentences and lacks the necessary HTML formatting and emphasis as described.\n3. As required by the description, the output should have at least three `<p>` tags, each containing HTML tags, which is not present in the output provided.\n\nGiven these points, the output violates the compliance requirement to transform the input paragraph into an HTML formatted text with the specified tags.\n\nERR"
