The output should have at least three `<p>` tags, with each sentence wrapped in a `<p>` tag.\n3. Each `<p>` tag should contain at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags.\n\nThe provided output completely disregards these formatting requirements. It instructs the user to give an answer in a text format that does not incorporate any HTML tags, specifically `<p>`, `<strong>`, or `<em>`. Instead, it seems to be requesting a type of response unrelated to the original formatting task.\n\nThere is a clear violation as the output does not exhibit the expected HTML formatting elements and does not adhere to the structure outlined in the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
