The description specifies that the output should format text using HTML, with each sentence wrapped in a `<p>` tag and containing at least three `<p>` tags in total. The output provided does not show any `<p>` tags.\n2. It specifies the inclusion of one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags in each `<p>` tag. The output does not correctly display HTML formatted text with these tags.\n\nBased on the evaluation, the output lacks `<p>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>` tags, which are essential according to the description. Therefore, the chatbot's output does not comply with the requirements specified in the description as it does not demonstrate the necessary HTML formatting structure.\n\nViolation:\n- The output lacks any `<p>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>` tags, which are explicitly required by the description.\n\nERR"
