The chatbot description specifically instructs that each sentence should be wrapped in a `<p>` tag, and within each `<p>` tag, there should be at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. The provided output does not follow these instructions, as it lacks any HTML tags.\n\nSince the output violates the requirement of formatting the text with HTML tags, specifically `<p>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>`, it directly violates the description's guidelines.\n\nERR"
