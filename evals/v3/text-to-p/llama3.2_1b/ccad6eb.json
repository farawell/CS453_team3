The description requires the chatbot to format a paragraph of text into HTML by splitting it into individual sentences and wrapping each sentence in a `<p>` tag. Each paragraph should also include at least one `<strong>` and multiple `<em>` tags. Instead, the output is a refusal to fulfill the request due to the nature of the content, which does not follow the specified task of formatting text in HTML. Thus, it violates the guideline to split the text into sentences and format it as HTML with the specified tags.\n\nERR"
