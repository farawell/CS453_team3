  "evaluation": "The evaluation focuses on checking compliance with the chatbot description, ignoring parts that require input knowledge. Based on the given output:\n\n1. **Paragraph Splitting and Tagging**: The output must contain at least three <p> tags, each wrapping a sentence. The output contains three <p> tags, one for each sentence about cats, dogs, and parrots, so this criterion is met.\n\n2. **Use of <strong> and <em> Tags**: Each <p> tag should include one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases. The output places <strong> tags between paragraphs and several <em> tags are included throughout the text. However, the <strong> tags are not inside <p> tags, which violates the requirement for each sentence inside a <p> tag to include a <strong> tag.\n\nBased on these observations, the primary issue lies with the placement of <strong> tags outside the <p> tags, which does not comply with the requirement to have them inside. This non-compliance with the placement requirement leads to an evaluation decision of 'ERR'.\n\nERR"
