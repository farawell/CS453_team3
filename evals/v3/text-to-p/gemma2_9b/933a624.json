In each of the sentences provided, only one <em> tag is used per <p> tag.\n\n2. **Inappropriate Emphasis**: There are no multiple <em> tags present in any of the <p> tags, while each sentence should ideally have multiple key phrases or words emphasized using <em> tags.\n\n3. **Formatting Anomaly**: In addition to the above, there are ** marks used instead of the required HTML tags, which suggests a deviation from the appropriate HTML formatting.\n\nEven though there are three sentences with each one wrapped in a <p> tag, the other aspects of the description requirements are not met.\n\nERR"
