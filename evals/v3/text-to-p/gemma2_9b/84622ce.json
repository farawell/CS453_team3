This structure meets the requirements outlined in the description, which specifies splitting the paragraph into individual sentences, using at least three `<p>` tags, and adding `<strong>` and `<em>` tags within each paragraph. There are no additional HTML tags present, and the use of `<p>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>` tags is compliant with the description provided. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
