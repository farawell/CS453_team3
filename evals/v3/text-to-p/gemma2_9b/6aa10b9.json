According to the description, each sentence should be wrapped in a `<p>` tag, which is correctly done as there are three `<p>` tags present, each containing a sentence. This satisfies the requirement for having at least three `<p>` tags.\n\nNext, within each `<p>` tag, there should be one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. In this output:\n\n1. First sentence: \"Bread is baked.\" contains two `<strong>` tags and one `<em>` tag.\n2. Second sentence: \"Butter is churned.\" also contains two `<strong>` tags and one `<em>` tag.\n3. Third sentence: \"Jam is sweetened.\" likewise contains two `<strong>` tags and one `<em>` tag.\n\nWhile each `<p>` tag correctly contains at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, the number of `<strong>` tags is more than one, which does not strictly comply with the description that states only one `<strong>` tag is needed per `<p>` tag. \n\nGiven that there are multiple `<strong>` tags in each `<p>` tag, this represents a non-compliance with the guideline that specifies one `<strong>` tag per sentence in a `<p>` tag.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
