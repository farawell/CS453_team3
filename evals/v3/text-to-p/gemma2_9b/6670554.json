Within each `<p>` tag, there is at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags used to emphasize words, which aligns with the description.\n\nHowever, there is an extra closing `</p>` tag at the end, which does not have a corresponding opening tag. This could be seen as a minor structural issue in the HTML formatting.\n\nTaking all these points into account:\n\nThere is a violation due to the incorrect number of closing `</p>` tags, which makes the structure improper.\n\nERR"
