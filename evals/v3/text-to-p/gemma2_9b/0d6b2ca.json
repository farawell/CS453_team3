Each sentence contains a `<strong>` tag to emphasize one word and one `<em>` tag to emphasize another word, satisfying the requirement for \"one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags\" within each `<p>` tag. Although there is only one `<em>` tag per `<p>` tag, the description allows for multiple `<em>` tags, and having one is compliant with the requirement.\n\nNo violations are noted; the output follows the format guidelines specified in the description. \n\nOK"
