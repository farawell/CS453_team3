The requirement to have at least three `<p>` tags is fulfilled since there are six `<p>` tags present.\n\nWithin each `<p>` tag, one `<strong>` tag is used to highlight words like \"I,\" \"trees,\" \"warmth,\" and \"laughter.\" Additionally, multiple `<em>` tags are used to emphasize words like \"see,\" \"feel,\" and \"hear.\" This aligns with the guideline to include one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags within each sentence.\n\nThere are no violations related to the number of `<p>` tags or the use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags within each sentence. As such, the output complies with the provided description. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
