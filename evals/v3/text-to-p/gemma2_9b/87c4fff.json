Furthermore, the guideline to have \"at least three <p> tags\" is also met, as there are six <p> tags in total. There is no additional requirement based on input-specific content that affects compliance. Therefore, the chatbot's output aligns directly with the description provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
