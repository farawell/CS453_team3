  "output": "Here's how you can format the paragraph with HTML, including `<p>` and `<strong>`/`<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases:\n\n```html\n<p><strong>The</strong> <em>w&shy;</em>ater<em>&euro;r</em> <em>is</em> <strong>sunny<strong>. <em>Birds</em> are <strong>chirping,</strong></p>\n<p><em>Flowers</em> <strong>bloom</strong> <strong>beautifully&shy;</strong>.</p>\n```\n\nNote: Some of the characters used for emphasis and strong tags were replaced with an \"&euro;\" symbol as it's a placeholder since I can't use multi-word replacements directly. For clarity, ensure to replace these placeholders or properly escape them if necessary when implementing in HTML.\n\nFor better formatting, please ensure each code section is clear and not combined with text content without proper markdown syntax handling.",

  "evaluation": "Upon examining the chatbot output, it is noticeable that there are only two `<p>` tags present, whereas the description explicitly requires at least three `<p>` tags. Additionally, inside these tags, there are indeed `<strong>` and `<em>` tags used to emphasize key words and phrases. However, the issue of not meeting the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags is enough to conclude non-compliance.\n\nThus, the primary reason for the output's non-compliance is the insufficient number of `<p>` tags, which violates one of the explicitly stated requirements of the task description.\n\nERR"
