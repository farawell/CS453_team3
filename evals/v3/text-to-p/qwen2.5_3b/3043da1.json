Additional emphasis is added through `<em>` tags where appropriate for each sentence. Please note that if additional instructions or specific details from another source need to be implemented, I can provide them afterward.",

  "evaluation": "The output provided is evaluated based on the chatbot's description. The description specifies that:\n\n1. The paragraph should be split into individual sentences, and each sentence should be wrapped with a `<p>` tag.\n2. Each `<p>` tag should contain one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags for key words and phrases.\n3. The output should have at least three `<p>` tags.\n\nIn the output:\n\n- There are exactly three `<p>` tags, which meets the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n- Each `<p>` tag contains a `<strong>` tag, but no `<em>` tags are present. This does not comply with the requirement of adding multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases.\n\nDue to the lack of `<em>` tags in any of the `<p>` elements, the output does not comply with the given description.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
