  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output wraps sentences in `<p>` tags, including at least three such tags, and correctly adds `<strong>` and `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag. While we do not know if it has split all the sentences correctly due to missing input, the output satisfies the rule of having at least three `<p>` tags and includes the `<strong>` and `<em>` tags as specified in the description. Therefore, based on the provided output alone and without the need to verify input-dependent conditions, the output complies with the given description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
