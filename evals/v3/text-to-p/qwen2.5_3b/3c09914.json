Split the paragraph into individual sentences and wrap each sentence with a `<p>` tag.\n2. Each `<p>` tag must contain at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags for emphasizing key words and phrases.\n3. The entire output should have at least three `<p>` tags.\n\nUpon reviewing the chatbot output:\n\n- The output contains three `<p>` tags, which meets the requirement of having at least three such tags.\n- Each `<p>` tag has one `<strong>` tag, which is correct.\n- However, the requirement for \"multiple `<em>` tags\" is not met as each sentence only has one `<em>` tag. The word \"multiple\" implies at least two `<em>` tags per sentence.\n\nGiven these observations, the output is non-compliant due to the use of only one `<em>` tag per sentence, whereas the requirement was for multiple `<em>` tags. Therefore, the output does not fully comply with the description.\n\nERR"
