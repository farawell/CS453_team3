  "evaluation": "The chatbot output presents HTML with each sentence wrapped in a `<p>` tag, meeting the requirement to \"wrap each sentence with a `<p>` tag.\" The output contains three `<p>` tags, which fulfills the requirement of having \"at least three `<p>` tags.\" Each `<p>` tag includes one `<strong>` tag, which surrounds the nouns \"Lions,\" \"Tigers,\" and \"Bears,\" aligning with the instruction to \"add one `<strong>` tag.\" Additionally, each sentence has an `<em>` tag to emphasize a key adjective: \"brave,\" \"fierce,\" or \"powerful.\" The description requires multiple `<em>` tags, but since the description does not specify how many words or phrases need emphasis or require differentiating between them, this part of compliance cannot be determined based solely on the output without knowing the original input. \n\nThe implementation satisfies the description elements that can be checked without the original input.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
