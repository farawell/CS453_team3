  "input": "Bread is baked. Butter is churned. Jam is sweetened.",
  "output": "To accomplish the task as specified, we first need to identify keywords and phrases that should be emphasized using <strong> tags inside each paragraph. Here are several sentences of original text with their appropriate formatting:\n\nFirst segment:\n- Sentence 1: \"Bread is baked.\"\n    - Key emphasis areas: 'Bread', 'baked'\n    \nNext segment:\n- Sentence 2: \"Butter is churned.\"\n    - Key emphasis areas: 'Butter', 'churned'\n\nLast segment:\n- Final sentence: \"Jam is sweetened.\"\n    - Key emphasis areas: 'Jam', 'sweetened'\n\nLet's integrate the above insights into proper HTML formatting:\n\n```html\n<p><strong>Bread</strong> is baked.<em>baked</em></p>\n<p><strong>Butter</strong> is churned.<em>churned</em></p>\n<p><strong>Jam</strong> is sweetened.<em>sweetened</em></p>\n```\n\nHere we wrapped each sentence in the `<p>` tag, added a `<strong>` tag for strong emphasis (the nouns), and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize the verbs or action words. Please let me know if my HTML formatting needs adjustments or more emphasis on specific part(s) of the text.\n  \nNote that the repetition may seem extraneous but it follows your instruction. We are emphasizing each key keyword within its respective sentence, such as 'Bread' for bread, 'baked' to highlight this is a subject, and so forth.\n\nI understand we have only three distinct sentences which might give an impression of redundancy. If the repetition needs more complex or nuanced handling due to any specific stylistic choice, please clarify further.",
