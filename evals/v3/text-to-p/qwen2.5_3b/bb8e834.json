Add one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag.\n\nNow, let's examine the output:\n\n- There are only two `<p>` tags in the output: \n  - `<p><strong>Rivers</strong> flow. <strong>Lakes</strong> settle. <strong>Oceans</strong> surge.</p>`\n  - `<p><em>Rivers</em> flow. <em>Lakes</em> settle. <em>Oceans</em> surge.</p>`\n\n- The number of `<p>` tags is insufficient as it is supposed to be at least three according to the description.\n- The descriptions state that each sentence should be individually wrapped in a `<p>` tag, but here, the sentences are combined within single `<p>` tags.\n  \nBecause the output does not meet the required number of `<p>` tags and does not wrap each sentence individually in a `<p>` tag, it does not comply with the description. Therefore, the evaluation is:\n\nThere is a violation of the rule requiring three `<p>` tags.\nERR"
