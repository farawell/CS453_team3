Each sentence will be treated as its own `<p>` element and styled with a `strong` tag emphasizing each key phrase, while additional emphasis can be added within those sentences if necessary.",

  "evaluation": "The evaluation of the chatbot output reveals the following:\n\n1. According to the description, each sentence in the paragraph should be wrapped in a `<p>` tag, which is correctly done in the output provided.\n2. Each `<p>` tag should contain one `<strong>` tag, which is also present in each of the `<p>` tags in the output.\n3. The description specifies that there should be multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag to emphasize key words and phrases. However, the output contains no `<em>` tags, which is a non-compliance with the given description.\n4. The output contains at least three `<p>` tags, which aligns with the requirement.\n\nBased on the presence of `<p>` and `<strong>` tags but the absence of multiple `<em>` tags, there is a violation of the description provided because the `<em>` tags are missing.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of required elements according to the description versus those present in the chatbot's output, the violation is clear:\n- Missing `<em>` tags in each `<p>` element.\n\nERR"
