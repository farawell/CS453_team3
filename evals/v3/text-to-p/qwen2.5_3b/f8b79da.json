Here is how it should be formatted:\n\n```html\n<p><strong>The ocean</strong> is vast.<br /><p>\n<em><strong>Mountains</strong></em> are tall.<br /><p>\n<em><strong>Deserts</strong></em> are hot.</p>\n```\n\nNote that for the second sentence (`\"Mountains are tall.\"`), I've assumed \"Oceans\" should be emphasized, resulting in a double emphasis. For the rest of the sentences, they were correctly split and emphasized as stated.\n\nIf there was intended separation into new paragraphs and emphasized phrases differently, please provide further details.",

  "evaluation": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description provided. Here are the reasons for the violation:\n\n1. **Closing Tags:** The output has `<p>` tags that are not properly closed. There is an incorrect use of `<br />` and `<p>` tag combinations which is not compliant with the requirement to have proper opening and closing `<p>` tags.\n\n2. **Minimum <p> tags:** There needs to at least be three complete `<p>` tags as per the requirement, but the second and third tags are not properly formatted and closed.\n\nBased on these observations, the output does not fully comply with the given description due to incorrect HTML structure.\n\nERR"
