Each `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag. However, there are no `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases within each sentence. The guideline specifies to include multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag, and this part of the specification was not met. \n\nBecause of the absence of `<em>` tags to emphasize additional key words and phrases, the output does not fully comply with the description.\n\nERR"
