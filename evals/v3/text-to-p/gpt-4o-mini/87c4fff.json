The description requires at least three `<p>` tags, so this output meets that requirement. Therefore, there is compliance with the description as it dictates splitting the paragraph into individual sentences and wrapping each sentence in a `<p>` tag, which has been done correctly. Additionally, the use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag complies with the requirement to emphasize key words and phrases. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
