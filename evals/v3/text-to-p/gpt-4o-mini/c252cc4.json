  "evaluation": "The output consists of six `<p>` tags, each containing a sentence with one `<strong>` tag and one `<em>` tag. The description specifies that the chatbot should format a paragraph of text as HTML by splitting it into individual sentences, wrapping each sentence with a `<p>` tag and ensuring there is at least three `<p>` tags, and adding one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags for emphasis on key words and phrases.\n\nThe output meets the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags. It also correctly includes a `<strong>` tag for each sentence. However, the requirement specifies multiple `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag, and the output includes only one `<em>` tag per `<p>` tag.\n\nTherefore, the output violates the rule requiring the use of multiple `<em>` tags in each sentence.\n\nThe violation is specific to the requirement for multiple `<em>` tags, as each sentence contains only one `<em>` tag.\n\nERR"
