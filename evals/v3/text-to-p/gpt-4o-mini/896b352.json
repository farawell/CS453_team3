Each sentence is wrapped in a `<p>` tag, which is correct according to the instruction. Within each `<p>` tag, there is exactly one `<strong>` tag used, and multiple `<em>` tags are used for emphasis, which is also in compliance with the instructions given. \n\nAlthough the same sentences are repeated, this does not violate the instructions described, as duplicates do not conflict with the requirement of having at least three <p> tags. Each individual `<p>` tag includes the necessary `<strong>` and `<em>` tags as required. \n\nTherefore, there are no violations.\n\nOK"
