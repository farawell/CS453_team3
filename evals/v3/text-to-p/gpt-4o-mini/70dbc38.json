According to the description, there should be a minimum of three `<p>` tags, which the output satisfies. Additionally, each paragraph contains one `<strong>` tag and at least one `<em>` tag. This directly complies with the description as each sentence has appropriately used at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags within the paragraphs. The occurrence of repetition in the content is not relevant as per the instructions since only compliance without checking input correctness or content correctness needs to be verified.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
