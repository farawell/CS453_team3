However, the description requires that the output should include at least three `<p>` tags, which the output fulfills. Additionally, each `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which also seems to be fulfilled as each sentence has one `<strong>` tag and the presence of `<em>` tags. Therefore, there are no violations in terms of the specified guidelines that do not depend on knowing the input\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
