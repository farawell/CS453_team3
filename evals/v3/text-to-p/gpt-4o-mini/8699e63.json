Each sentence is indeed encapsulated in a separate `<p>` tag. Furthermore, every `<p>` tag includes one `<strong>` tag and at least one `<em>` tag, as required. Therefore, the output complies with the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags and includes the necessary `<strong>` and `<em>` tags for emphasis within each `<p>` tag. There is no requirement violation based on the criteria provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
