Additionally, the output should have at least three `<p>` tags.\n\nUpon examining the output, I observe the following:\n\n1. There are six `<p>` tags in the output, which meets the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n2. Each `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag and at least one `<em>` tag, thereby fulfilling the requirement of adding emphasis with key HTML tags.\n\nThe output complies with the description as per the points that can be verified without knowledge of the input. Therefore, everything is fulfilling the given requirements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
