Each `<p>` tag contains both a `<strong>` tag and at least one `<em>` tag, which is in line with the instruction to emphasize key words or phrases with these tags. There are no violations of the formatting rules or the structure requirements, since each sentence is properly wrapped in a `<p>` tag and emphasis is added with both `<strong>` and `<em>` tags.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
