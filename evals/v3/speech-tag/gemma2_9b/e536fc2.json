The description specifies that if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, it should return \"Unknown\", but this directive requires knowing the input which is unavailable. Hence, it's not possible to check for that and should be ignored. The output properly includes just the part of speech tag as required. Since the rules that require the input for evaluation are being ignored, there is no non-compliance with the given task description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
