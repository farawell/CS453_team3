The description specifies a list of permissible tags, and \"VBZ: Verb, 3rd person singular present\" is included in this list. The output complies with the requirement to return just the tag for the word's part of speech without any additional information. Since there is no specific context or input needed to verify the correctness of the tag, I am only evaluating whether the output adheres to the formatting and restrictions set by the description, which it does.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
