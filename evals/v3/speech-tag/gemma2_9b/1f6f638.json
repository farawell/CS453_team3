The description specifies that the task is to return just the part of speech tag for a given word, and \"MD\" is indeed a valid part of speech tag from the specified list. Since the compliance check is based on whether the output matches one of the predefined part of speech tags or other specified outputs like \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer,\" and this output does match one of the valid tags, it complies with the description provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
