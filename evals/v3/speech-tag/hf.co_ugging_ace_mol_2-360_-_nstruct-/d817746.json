The description specifies that the output should be just the tag and does not require any additional explanation or descriptors. Therefore, the output should have been simply \"CC\" without any additional wording or description attached. Because the output includes an explanation (\"Coordinating conjunction\") alongside the tag, it does not comply with the description.\n\nERR"
