The output here provides additional explanatory information, such as the context of how the word \"beautiful\" was used in the sentence. According to the instructions, only the tag itself should be returned without any further explanation or context.\n\nFurthermore, the tag \"CC\" is incorrect for the word \"beautiful,\" as the tag for adjectives, which \"beautiful\" is, should be \"JJ.\" However, determining the correctness of the tag requires knowing the input sentence, so this cannot factor into our compliance evaluation.\n\nThe primary issue with the output is that it includes additional information rather than solely the tag itself.\n\nERR"
