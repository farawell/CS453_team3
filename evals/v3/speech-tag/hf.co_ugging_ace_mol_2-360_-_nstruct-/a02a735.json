  "evaluation": "The output contains two elements separated by semicolons, \"Unknown\" and \"Unacceptable.\" According to the description, the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag, and if it cannot tag the word, it should return \"Unknown.\" The presence of \"Unacceptable\" in this output indicates a deviation from the expected response format. The output should contain only one word or tag, either the part of speech tag or \"Unknown.\" The inclusion of \"Unacceptable\" suggests an extra, unnecessary element that is not in accordance with the guidelines.\n\nERR"
