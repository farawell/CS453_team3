According to the description, the chatbot should return only a part of speech tag for the given word or, if applicable, return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer.\" However, the output provided says \"Wrong Answer\" followed by a description of what to do and what not to do, which does not comply with the instruction to return solely a part of speech tag. The response deviates from the simplicity of returning a single tag or specific responses like \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer.\"\n\nERR"
