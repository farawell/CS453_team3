The task requires returning only the part of speech tag for a given word in a sentence, whereas the output provided is a full sentence instead. There's no mention of a specific part of speech tag such as those listed (e.g., NN, VB, JJ, etc.), nor is there an indication that the tag is either \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer.\" This output does not fulfill the requirement to return just the tag.\n\nERR"
