The list includes specific tags such as \"NN\" for singular nouns or \"NNS\" for plural nouns, but it does not use the generic term \"NOUN.\" Therefore, the term \"NOUN\" does not match any of the tags provided in the part-of-speech tag list in the description. Since \"NOUN\" is not a valid tag according to the specified list, the output violates the description requirements.\n\nERR"
