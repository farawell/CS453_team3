Since we don't have the input to verify the correctness, we only check for format and compliance reasons. The output should simply say \"Unknown\" without any additional characters or symbols. The presence of a colon (\":\") before \"Unknown\" does not comply with the required format specified in the description. Therefore, the output does not meet the exact prescribed format.\n\nERR"
