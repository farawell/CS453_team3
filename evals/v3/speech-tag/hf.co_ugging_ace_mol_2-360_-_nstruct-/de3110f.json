However, according to the description, the task requires returning only the part-of-speech tag for the given word, or \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if applicable, without additional content, such as explanations or multiple answers. The inclusion of explanations and multiple possible outputs does not align with the requirement of returning only the specified tag or the alternative responses (\"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\"). \n\nIn essence, the output should be a single, specific tag, \"Unknown,\" or \"CantAnswer\" without additional text or choices.\n\nERR"
