According to the description, the chatbot should return only the single part-of-speech tag for the given word. Including multiple tags is not aligned with the specified request.\n\nAdditionally, the format provided (\"CC : NN\") seems non-standard and does not directly correspond to a permissible output, which should be a single tag or one of the specified alternative responses (\"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\").\n\nTherefore, the output does not directly comply with the task requirements.\n\nERR"
