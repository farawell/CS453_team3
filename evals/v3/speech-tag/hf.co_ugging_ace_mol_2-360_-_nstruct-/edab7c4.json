Sunny? Yes. Xylophone? YES\" does not adhere to the requested format of a single part of speech tag or one of the predefined responses (\"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\"). Instead, the response appears to be answering a series of questions, showing no compliance with the description that specifies the expected output format.\n\nERR"
