The description specifically instructs to return only the part of speech tag for a given word in the sentence. However, the chatbot output presents a sentence, \"The convoy comprised several trucks,\" and then lists multiple part of speech tags but does not specify which tag corresponds to a particular word in the sentence. The expected output format should simply be a single part of speech tag or \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if applicable, and nothing else.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
