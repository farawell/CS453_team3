The most common transcriptions in American English, however, would be \"PRP\" for pronoun and \"[INF] / PRPZ\" for non-3rd person singular present of verb (for this case: they are). \n\nIn a sentence, \"They are attending\" is a simple sentence with a main clause and an object. As such, the entire sentence should not be tagged as CC.",

  "evaluation": "The provided output does not comply with the task description. The main issues are:\n\n1. **Output Format**: The task specifies that only the part of speech tag for a single given word should be returned. The output unnecessarily includes explanations and multiple words instead of providing a single tag.\n\n2. **Use of Non-Standard Tags**: The output used \"VAE (Verb Agreement)\" which is not listed in the provided part of speech tags. The description specifies a particular set of part of speech tags to be used, and \"VAE\" is not among them.\n\n3. **Additional Information**: The output includes additional information and explanations about grammar rules and variations, which is not required by the task description.\n\nBased on these observations, the output violates the specified requirements.\n\nERR"
