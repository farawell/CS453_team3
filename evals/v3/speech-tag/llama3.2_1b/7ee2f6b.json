  "evaluation": "The chatbot output includes the phrase, \"The word 'friends' is a noun\" followed by \"The final answer is: NN\". The description provides a list of specific part-of-speech tags, and \"NN\" is listed as \"Noun, singular or mass\" while \"NNS\" is for \"Noun, plural\". Since the word \"friends\" would likely be plural, the expected tag should be \"NNS\". However, identifying the correct tag requires knowing the input, which we don't have. Since we can't determine correctness without the input, we should only evaluate the description's requirement: \"Return only the part of speech tag.\" Here, the chatbot output added supplementary information (\"friends\" is a noun) rather than returning just the tag as initially instructed.\n\nThe violation is that the chatbot did not return solely the part of speech tag as required by the description. It provided an explanation (i.e., \"'friends' is a noun\") before giving the tag. This output goes beyond what is specified in the task description.\n\nERR"
