There is no additional information, and it clearly adheres to the requirement to return just the part of speech tag. Since the compliance check focuses on whether the output matches the specified tags and format requirements and not on the correctness of the tag itself in relation to an unknown input sentence, the output is compliant with the description provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
