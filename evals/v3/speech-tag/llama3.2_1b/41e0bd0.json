  "output": "## Determination\n\n- **DC:** Cardinal number\n- **JJR:** Adjective, comparative\n- **JJS:** Adjective, superlative\n\nSince the sentence \"An exemplary\" can't be directly tagged as a noun or its variations like demonstratives etc. \n\nConsidering it could possibly relate to time/explanation (\"an\" has a dual function here) \n\nTherefore I'll tag 'An' ('JJR') for adjective, comparative and \n\"Example\" (a demonstrative - adverbial) for JJS.\n\nHowever as you can see the sentence doesn't convey information that fits strictly under a noun. Also since examples in definition of an \"adjective superlative noun\" don't really make sense either  I believe  An exemplary display of skill; display isn't well suited to this task \n\nSo my final answer is Unknown.\n\nThe best answer is $\\boxed{Unknown}$",

  "evaluation": "The output provided by the chatbot does not comply with the specified description. According to the description, the output should only contain a single part of speech tag or one of the special responses (\"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\"). However, the output includes a detailed explanation and multiple part of speech tags, which go against the rule to return only the part of speech tag. Moreover, even though the response concludes with \"Unknown,\" the overall output still violates the requirement by providing additional unnecessary details.\n\nERR"
