The description specifies a comprehensive list of acceptable part-of-speech tags, such as CC, CD, DT, EX, etc. There is no allowance in the description for tags outside of those explicitly listed, and the output must return one of these tags or the words \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if it cannot be tagged using the listed tags.\n\nIn this case, the word \"Determiner\" implicitly suggests possible evaluation context (tag DT), but without the input, explicit tag adherence is necessary. Since \"TT\" does not match any tag from the description, the output violates the compliance rule.\n\nERR"
