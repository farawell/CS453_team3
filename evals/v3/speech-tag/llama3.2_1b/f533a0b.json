The description specifies that the chatbot should output only the part of speech tag or \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\". It should not provide any additional information, such as explanations or steps.\n\nIn this case, the chatbot output provides an explanation that \"fluuent\" is a French adjective and then proceeds to give the part of speech tag as \"JJ\". This violates the directive to return only the part of speech tag without additional text or explanation. The final answer should solely consist of the tag \"JJ\" without any surrounding text or elaboration.\n\nTherefore, the output violates the guidelines by including unnecessary information.\n\nERR"
