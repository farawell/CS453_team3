This aligns with the requirement that the output should only be a part of speech tag, \"Unknown\", or \"CantAnswer\". Since the description does not require any additional formatting or content in the response and does not provide any specific guideline that contradicts the output given, there is no violation of the rules. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
