The task specifically requires returning only the part-of-speech tag for the given word, and the output seems to comply with this requirement. There are no additional elements like explanations or other tags that violate the output guidelines. Thus, the output directly aligns with the described task of returning only the POS tag from the listed options.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
