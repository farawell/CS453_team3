According to the description, the chatbot is allowed to return \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with any of the listed part-of-speech tags. Since \"Unknown\" is an acceptable response when tagging the part of speech isn't possible, the output complies with the chatbot's description. There is no indication that the description has been violated, as \"Unknown\" is one of the specified tags that can be used in such situations.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
