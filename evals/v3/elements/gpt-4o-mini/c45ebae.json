Even if no company names are present in the input text, the output should maintain the desired format of marking it as an empty list or similar indication. \n\nThe format requires the output to be presented as:\n1. Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n2. People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\n3. Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\n4. General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n\nIn this output:\n- \"Company names:\" is empty without clear indication of an empty list.\n- \"People names: -||-\" does follow the format for indicating an absence or unavailability of names.\n- \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" follow the comma-separated format.\n\nDue to the lack of a clear indication for an empty list of company names, the output does not fully comply with the description.\n\nERR"
