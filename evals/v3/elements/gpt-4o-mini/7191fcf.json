Each of the required categories is present:\n\n1. \"Company names\" are listed first, with a clear heading and a comma-separated list followingâ€”though only one company is listed.\n2. \"People names\" are listed next, again with a clear heading and a comma-separated list.\n3. \"Specific topics\" are listed after in a clear manner similar to the others.\n4. \"General themes\" are then listed last with a clear heading.\n\nThe organization and labeling align with the directive given in the description, and thus, the output format is consistent with what the task specifies, not requiring external information for the categories to align in placement or label.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
