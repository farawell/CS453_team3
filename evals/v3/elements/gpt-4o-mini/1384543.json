  "evaluation": "The chatbot output is generally formatted according to the desired structure, which includes sections for \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" However, the \"Specific topics\" section is left completely blank, whereas the other sections are filled, even if with an indication that there's nothing to list. This lack of information in just the \"Specific topics\" section, without any explanation or indication that there are no specific topics to extract, deviates from the standard format provided in the description. The presence of just \"General themes\" without corresponding input-specific extractions suggests incomplete compliance.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
