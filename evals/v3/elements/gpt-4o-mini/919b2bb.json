  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output adheres to the format specified in the description, as it provides separate sections for \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" The placeholder '-||-' is used for \"People names,\" indicating that no names were extracted. This is consistent with the described format. There are no evident violations based solely on the description given, as checking the correctness of extracted elements requires knowledge of the input, which is not available here.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
