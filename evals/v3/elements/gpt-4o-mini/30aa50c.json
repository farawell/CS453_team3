The required format for the extracted elements includes a comma-separated list of company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. The output provided includes:\n\n- Company names are listed as \"PayPal, Stripe,\" which is correctly formatted as a comma-separated list.\n- People names are noted with a dash \"-\", indicating that no people names were found. While technically compliant, it follows the format for this section.\n- Specific topics are provided as \"online payments, fintech growth,\" which is also a correctly formatted comma-separated list.\n- General themes are listed as \"digital economy, financial technology,\" again using a comma-separated list.\n\nThe output seems to follow the described format correctly. There is no obvious deviation from the format outlined in the description. The absence of people names is denoted with a dash, which could be considered an appropriate indication of their absence. Since the evaluation does not consider the correctness or completeness of the extracted data but only the formatting, this output is in compliance.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
