According to the description, the format should include a comma-separated list of company names and people names, not just a placeholder or empty list. In the output provided, \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections are both incomplete as they do not contain the required comma-separated lists; instead, the \"People names\" section uses the placeholder \"-||-\", which should have been used only if there were no people names to extract. However, the \"Company names\" section still should not be entirely empty without any placeholder or explanation, indicating that there are no companies mentioned, which is a deviation from the specified format.\n\nERR"
