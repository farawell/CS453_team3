  "evaluation": "The chatbot output is expected to follow a specific format which includes sections for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. Each section should be filled with a comma-separated list. In the given output:\n\n- The \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections are empty, which might be acceptable if there were genuinely none present in the input text, but we can't assess this without the input text.\n- The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections contain entries as expected. They have \"tech shifts\" for specific topics and \"thematic discussions\" for general themes, presented in a plain text format, indicating that they meet the requirement of being lists, even if they are single items.\n\nWithout input context, it's not possible to assess whether extraction was correct, only if the result is formatted correctly. From this perspective, the output follows the format described in the chatbot requirements.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that the lack of content for company and people names doesn't inherently mean non-compliance if no such elements were in the text. Thus, the evaluation on this part can't be completed unless the input content is known. \n\nBased solely on formatting compliance and the presence of outputs in the expected fields, the output format is correct.\n\nOK"
