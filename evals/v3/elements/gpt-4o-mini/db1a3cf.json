The output format specified in the description is:\n\n- Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n- People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\n- Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\n- General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n\nThe provided output includes:\n\n- Company names: \n- People names: \n- Specific topics: \n- General themes: Subject matters, Leadership, Inclusion\n\nUpon evaluating the output, it appears there are sections for each category, but both \"Company names\" and \"People names\" are empty, not even a placeholder or indicator of \"None\" or similar. The \"Specific topics\" section is entirely missing, which is a deviation from the desired format, as each section is expected to have a label even if it's empty. The \"General themes\" section has content.\n\nBased on the description, each section should appear explicitly, even if there is nothing to extract from the input text, to comply with the format requirements. The absence of \"Specific topics\" section even as an empty label violates the output format expectation.\n\nERR"
