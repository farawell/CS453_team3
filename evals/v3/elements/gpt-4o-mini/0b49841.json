  "evaluation": "The output does not fully comply with the desired format specified in the description. While the output lists \"Company names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes,\" it incorrectly uses the placeholder \"-||-\" under \"People names\" instead of a comma-separated list of any extracted names or leaving it empty if there are none. \n\nThe description specifies that after extracting all company names, all people names should be extracted, followed by specific topics and general overarching themes. The placeholder \"-||-\" is incorrectly used when there are no people names to list.\n\nBased on the compliance analysis related to the output format, the violation arises from the incorrect use of \"-||-\" in the \"People names\" field since it should not use a placeholder when there are no entities of that type present in the text.\n\nERR"
