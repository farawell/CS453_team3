  "evaluation": "The output does not comply with the description because it violates the required format. Firstly, under \"Company names,\" the output does not provide a comma-separated list; instead, it is left blank, violating the prescribed format. Secondly, for \"People names,\" it uses the same placeholder \"-||-\", which should be replaced with actual names in a comma-separated list when applicable or remain blank if none are present in the input text. Although it's not possible to determine the correctness of the extracted elements (since the input is not provided), the output structure should still adhere to the described format. Therefore, this output does not meet the requirements as described.\n\nERR"
