The output is organized into four distinct categories: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. Each category is separated by a colon, and the items in the lists are separated by commas, which is consistent with the requested comma-separated list format. Since checking the correctness of extracted content requires knowing the input text and is beyond the scope of evaluation, the format compliance is what is assessed and found to be correct.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
