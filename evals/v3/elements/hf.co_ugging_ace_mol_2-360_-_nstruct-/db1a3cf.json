There are several issues to point out:\n\n1. **Format Non-Compliance**: \n   - The output does not match the desired format of \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\". Instead, it shows \"company names: -,,-\" which does not correspond with a list of names.\n   - Similarly, for \"People names\", the format requirement was not met with the output \"People names: -,~\".\n   - For \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\", the use of varied delimiters like \"||||\" and \"|||||\" and the inclusion of numbers like \"15-5239\" does not adhere to the specified format.\n\n2. **Request for Tabular Format**: \n   - The output includes instructions to \"please include the extracted data in a table\" which is not a part of the desired format outlined in the chatbot description.\n\nGiven these discrepancies, the output fails to adhere to the specified formatting and structure requirements.\n\nERR"
