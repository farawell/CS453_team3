  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output shows extracted elements labeled as \"Company names\" with placeholders instead of comma-separated lists, and it includes non-compliant labels like \"cultural_contexts\" which are not part of the desired format. The output fails to provide separate lists for \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes,\" as required.\n\nAdditionally, the placeholder terms seem to substitute actual entities rather than extracting them, which is not compliant with the specification. Overall, the output does not adhere to the desired format outlined in the chatbot's description.\n\nERR"
