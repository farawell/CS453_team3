The desired format is:\n\n- Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n- People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\n- Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\n- General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n\nEvaluating the provided output, we observe the following issues:\n\n1. **People Names**: The people names are not listed in a comma-separated format as required; instead, they are presented as a vertical list with dashes.\n\n2. **Specific Topics**: Topics should be in a comma-separated format, but they are listed vertically using bullet points.\n\n3. **General Themes**: Themes should also be in a comma-separated list, but they are listed vertically without any separation.\n\nThese points reflect direct non-compliance with the format described in the template. Thus, while the classification into categories is present, it does not conform to the required formatting.\n\nTherefore, the decision is based on the format violations regarding the listing of names, topics, and themes.\n\nERR"
