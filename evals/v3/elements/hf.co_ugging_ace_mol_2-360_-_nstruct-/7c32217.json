The central discussions were centered on sustainability and technological innovation.",
  "output": "Company names: Tesla, SpaceX  \nPeople names: Elon Musk - Elon's name as well as \"spaceX\", his company. - We will see how some text can contain different information like a user's name or a specific topic so we need to filter it out to get the core message",

  "evaluation": "The chatbot output lists company names and people names, but it does not follow the desired format described. The format where company names and people names should be separated by commas without additional description or commentary is not adhered to. Additional commentary is present, which is not part of the desired output format. Therefore, the format guideline is violated.\n\nSpecifically:\n- The \"People names\" section contains narrative text (\"- Elon's name as well...\"), which deviates from the expected short form output of names.\n\nThis led me to conclude there is a violation with the expected format for output according to the description.\n\nERR"
