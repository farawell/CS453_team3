Here's your edit: \n\nExtract the important entities mentioned in the text below. First extract all company names, then extract specific people names, next extract any related topics including \"privacy\" but exclude \"security\" as specified, then finally extract general overarching themes along with specific elements like company name and person names.",

The description specifies that the chatbot should extract company names, people names, specific topics, and general overarching themes in a specific format:\n\n- Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n- People names: -||-\n- Specific topics: -||-\n- General themes: -||-\n\nThe output provided doesn't adhere to this format. Additionally, the description doesn't mention any modifications to the extraction criteria, such as specifying particular topics like \"privacy\" and excluding certain ones like \"security.\" Furthermore, the output seems to be discussing an example rather than listing these elements in the desired format.\n\nThe lack of adherence to the specified output format and the inclusion of additional extraction criteria not mentioned in the description are the reasons for non-compliance.\n\nERR"
