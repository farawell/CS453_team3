  "evaluation": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description. According to the description, the output should be formatted to clearly separate company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, in the provided output, there is a lack of clear separation and organization. \n\n1. The line labeled \"Company names\" does not contain a list of company names; it includes both people names and a company name in a sentence form. This does not comply with the expected comma-separated list format for just company names.\n\nThus, the structure and organization of the output are not in line with the desired format stated in the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
