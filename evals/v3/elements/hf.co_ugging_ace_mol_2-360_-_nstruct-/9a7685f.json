  "evaluation": "The chatbot output does not follow the required format as described in the task. The required format is clearly specified in the description and should have the format:\n\n- Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n- People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\n- Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\n- General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n\nIn the provided output, the section for \"People names\" is inconsistent, presenting garbled text likely due to an error (\"-OR- - ORORANGE HANGMAN BULL #\"), which does not follow the desired format outlined in the description. There are no \"comma_separated_list_of_company_names\" or even a list for \"People names\". Moreover, the phrase \"Apple, Google\" under \"Specific topics\" is confusing because these are typically company names, although without the input text, we cannot definitively determine their role as topics.\n\nDue to the incorrect format and compliance issues with the \"People names\" and potential non-compliance on other lines, the output does not meet the described requirements.\n\nERR"
