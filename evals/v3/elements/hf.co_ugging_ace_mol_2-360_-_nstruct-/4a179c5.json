  "evaluation": "The chatbot output attempts to follow the desired format specified in the description. It lists company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, there is an inconsistency in how the list of company names is presented. According to the description, all lists should be presented as \"<comma_separated_list_of_items>\". In the output provided: \n\n- \"Company names\" section lacks the necessary comma-separated format and is instead presented on separate lines and one company name is in the people names section.\n- Similar format should be maintained for People names, Specific topics, and General themes. Any list within a section should be comma-separated within the same line.\n\nThe description is strict about the desired format, and hence, not complying with this format represents a violation. \n\nERR"
