The description specifies that the output should follow a structured format: listing company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes separately, even if some of these categories are empty or have no elements to extract. The output given is a narrative explanation rather than adhering to the specified format.\n\nTo comply, even if no entities or topics are present, it should at least reflect the structure like: \n\n```\nCompany names: \nPeople names: \nSpecific topics: \nGeneral themes: \n```\n\nSince the chatbot's output does not match this prescribed format, it fails to comply with the description.\n\nERR"
