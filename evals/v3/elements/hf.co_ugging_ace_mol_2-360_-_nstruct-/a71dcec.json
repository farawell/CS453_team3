The description specifies that the output should be in a particular format:\n\n```\nCompany names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\nPeople names: -||-\nSpecific topics: -||-\nGeneral themes: -||-\n```\n\nHowever, the output provided by the chatbot appears to be pseudo-code or instructions for a process rather than a final formatted output. It mentions using a function `extract_company_names` but doesn't give the extracted results in the required format.\n\nAdditionally, it does not include any information about people names, specific topics, or general themes, which are all required parts of the output format as per the description.\n\nTherefore, the output fails to comply with the specified format and content requirements.\n\nERR"
