The available entities are company names, people names (including identifying pronouns), topics, and general themes. These entities will be extracted as part of the text structure that the program analyzes based on a specified pattern or context provided by you.\n\nFor example, given a sentence like \"The most impactful change occurred in Tech trends with  AI being at the forefront,\" your OpenAI model may extract:\n  - company name (the most impactful change) -people names (\"theatr\") – tech trends – ai\n\nIn order to facilitate proper extraction, please provide the relevant information about each entity you want extracted from a text prompt and describe the pattern or context in which these elements should be used.",

  "evaluation": "The output provided does not comply with the chatbot's description. The description outlines that the output should be in a specific format with categorized lists for \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" However, the output given does not follow this format. Instead, it provides a general explanation of how the extraction process works and an example that incorrectly lists a \"company name\" and \"people names\" without clearly fitting into the desired format.\n\nAdditionally, the output includes an example which does not seem to logically extract company names or people names correctly, further straying from the given task format. \n\nThis lack of adherence to the specified format leads to the conclusion of non-compliance with the description.\n\nERR"
