For example: [enterprise solutions]\n\nI've updated my implementation to match this format and should be able to extract everything you mentioned correctly. Does it now show up as expected?",
  "compliance": "err",
  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output partially follows the desired format mentioned in the description by listing company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes in separate sections. However, it deviates from the format specified in the description in a few ways:\n\n1. The description requests a \"comma_separated_list_of_company_names\" and similarly formatted lists for people names, specific topics, and general themes. While the chatbot provides a comma-separated list, it incorrectly mentions that items should be \"enclosed in square brackets,\" which is not required by the description.\n\n2. The section where the chatbot talks about its implementation and format changes is extraneous and not a part of the specified output format in the description.\n\nThese points indicate non-compliance with the format specification provided in the description.\n\nERR"
