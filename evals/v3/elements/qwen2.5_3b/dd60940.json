  "input": "The panel discussed renewable energy, sustainability, and eco-friendly products.",
  "output": "Company names: \nPeople names: -||-\nSpecific topics: renewable energy, sustainability, eco-friendly products\nGeneral themes: environmental concerns, future technologies, corporate responsibility",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "evaluation": "The chatbot output is evaluated against the provided description. According to the description, the output must include four sections: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. Each section should list the extracted elements separated by commas if there are multiple items. In this case:\n\n1. **Company names** is present but empty. The expectation was to list company names, if any, in a comma-separated format. If there are no company names, this absence should be noted clearly rather than leaving it blank. However, given the rules, evaluating the correctness would require input data, which is not available, so this could be compliant.\n\n2. **People names** is formatted as \"-||-\" which complies with the description format, although determining correctness requires knowing the input. Thus, compliance is presumed.\n\n3. The **Specific topics** are listed in comma-separated format, complying with the structure described.\n\n4. The **General themes** are also listed in a comma-separated format, complying with the structure described.\n\nOverall, except for potential ambiguity in how a lack of company names is represented (which requires input to determine correctness), the format adheres to the provided instructions. Based on the description, and without input, the compliance aspect is satisfied.\n\nOK"
