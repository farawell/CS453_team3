  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output doesn't fully comply with the description's desired format. The description specifies that the output should list entities under each category: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes in a comma-separated list format. The actual output does not provide this structure, instead outputting empty lists or incomplete representations. \"-\" is used instead of the expected \"-||-\" for specific topics, indicating inconsistency in formatting within the guidelines provided in the description.\n\nThe issues identified are:\n- The section for \"Specific topics\" does not use the format \"-||-\" and is instead represented by \"-\" which is inconsistent with the rest of the format.\n- It fails to list entities, even if hypothetically there were none, adherence to expected formats such as listing \"none\" in cases where no entities fit might be suggested instead of just leaving it empty.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, it is clear that the output does not meet the explicit format requirements.\n\nERR"
