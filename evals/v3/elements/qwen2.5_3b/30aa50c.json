  "evaluation": "The chatbot output complies with the description in terms of formatting and structure. It lists company names under the \"Company names\" heading and specific topics under the \"Specific topics\" heading. It also lists general overarching themes under the \"General themes\" heading. There is a slight deviation in the \"People names\" section, where a dash is used instead of \"-||-\", but this does not significantly deviate from the provided format. Since it does not affect the comprehensibility or overall structure as outlined, I would consider this compliant. Therefore, there is no major violation of the expected output format. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
