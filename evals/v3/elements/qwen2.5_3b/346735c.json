  "evaluation": "The chatbot output appears to have a formatting issue for the section \"Company names,\" where it lists names that seem to be individuals rather than company names. Given the information provided, the names \"Larry Page,\" \"Satya Nadella,\" and \"Mark Zuckerberg\" are generally recognized as individuals rather than company entities. This placement indicates a potential category error as they should logically be included under \"People names\" rather than \"Company names.\"\n\nAdditionally, the section for \"People names\" is incorrectly formatted as \"-||-\" suggesting no names are extracted, even though names are present in the output. This inconsistency violates the extract, categorize, and format rules outlined in the chatbot's description.\n\nConsidering the rules and description provided, this inconsistency in categorization and formatting disrupts the requirement to extract entities according to their designated categories accurately.\n\nERR"
