  "evaluation": "The evaluation focuses on the format of the chatbot's output as per the description. The desired format is clearly outlined in the description:\n\n1. **Company names**: The output lists what appears to be thematic areas (\"automation\" and \"artificial_intelligence\") as company names, which do not comply with the expected format of actual company names.\n2. **People names**: Correctly uses the given placeholder format '-||-' to indicate no people names were identified. This is compliant.\n3. **Specific topics** and **General themes**: Both sections seem to follow the expected format with comma-separated lists which relate to the overall concepts rather than companies or individuals.\n\nThe major point of non-compliance is in the \"Company names\" section, as the terms listed do not appear to be actual company names, violating the expected format. Hence, output does not comply with the description.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
