The expected format requires listing out the company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes, with each category being separated by commas if there are multiple items, or explicitly stating there are none using the placeholder \"-||-\". In this output:\n\n1. The \"Company names\" section is empty without indicating there are none with \"-||-\".\n2. The \"People names\" section correctly uses \"-||-\" to indicate absence, which is compliant.\n3. The \"Specific topics\" section also uses \"-||-\", indicating absence, which is compliant.\n4. The \"General themes\" section contains \"strategic development\", which follows the expected format.\n\nGiven the mismatch in output structure for the company names, the output does not fully comply with the chatbot's description.\n\nERR"
