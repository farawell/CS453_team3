  "evaluation": "The chatbot output follows the desired format specified in the description except in one place. The output has sections titled \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\" as required. However, the section \"Specific topics\" should list topics according to the format `<comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>`. Instead of that, the output just contains a placeholder \"-||-\".\n\nTherefore, the output does not fully comply with the description as the placeholder \"-||-\" should only be used when no data exists to input for that section, and without the input, we cannot confirm if that's the case. Thus, the presence of \"-||-\" suggests that the section was not filled out properly or the format was not followed in this specific instance.\n\nERR"
