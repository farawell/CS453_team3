  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output is in the correct format as specified in the description, listing company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes in the desired structure. The format requirements are met: each category is present, and the information is separated by commas where needed. \n\nThere are no elements in the output given that would suggest any non-compliance with the chatbot description. All categories are provided their respective lists, even where a category (People names) appears empty; this absence is consistent with the format since list values are comma-separated and the description does not require a minimum number of extracted items.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
