  "evaluation": "The chatbot output is evaluated based on the description provided. The description specifies the desired format for the output, which includes four sections: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes.\n\nIn the chatbot's output:\n\n1. **Company names**: The output states \"None,\" which fits the expected format as there are no company names mentioned.\n\n2. **People names**: The output follows the prescribed format but contains no content after the separator \"—||—\", indicating no people names mentioned.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: This section is entirely empty. The description requires specific topics even if none are identified, a format should be maintained for consistency (similar to 'None' as indicated for company names). The empty section directly violates the described format.\n\n4. **General themes**: This section is provided with multiple entries and follows the expected format.\n\nThe primary issue is the lack of content or placeholder (\"None\") for the Specific topics section, which breaks consistency in formatting as required by the output specification.\n\nERR"
