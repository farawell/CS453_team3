People names are prefixed with \"People names: \" followed by a comma-separated list.\n3. Specific topics are prefixed with \"Specific topics: \" followed by a comma-separated list.\n4. General themes are prefixed with \"General themes: \" followed by a comma-separated list.\n\nUpon examining the chatbot's output, several issues are evident:\n\n- The format does not comply with the specified format. It uses bullet points and dashes instead of the required comma-separated list under clear headings prefixed by the specified labels.\n- The text expressly mentions \"None\" and \"none\" rather than leaving the section empty if no elements are found.\n- The use of \"None found\" and \"Reshaping industries worldwide | Transforming the global workforce\" does not align with the expected comma-separated format for themes.\n\nThese deviations from the description demonstrate non-compliance with the required format.\n\nERR"
