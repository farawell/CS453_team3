  "output": "## Safety: Non-Functional Requirements\nThere are no non-functional requirements mentioned for this text.\n\n## Complexity: Readability\nThe complexity of the text is medium to high, as it requires breaking down large blocks of text into smaller sections with clear headings and concise language.\n\n## Code Quality:\nThere are no code samples or snippets provided in this text. The description is in prose format, making it more suitable for human readability than a technical coding explanation.\n\n## Performance: Execution Time\nThe execution time of the described process does not provide information about its performance capabilities. However, if we consider a simple example using Markdown formatting to extract elements from a given text, the process could be as follows:\n\n```\n# Extract Elements of Text\ndescription: Extract specific elements of text from a given text\n\nsource: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-the-openai-api\n\ninputs:\n  text:\n    type: string\n```\n\nHere's an example of extracting important entities:\n\n```markdown\n# Extraction\n\n## Company Names\n### PayPal\n### Stripe\n\n## People Names\n- None mentioned\n\n## Specific Topics\n### Online Payments\n### Fintech Growth\n\n## General Themes\n### Digital Economy\n### Financial Technology\n```\n\nEach company name is listed in a separate heading indented with an increasing number of dashes (`---`), followed by the corresponding company name. The sections are labeled `People Names`, `Specific Topics`, and `General Themes`. This method allows for clear separation of content and easy navigation.\n\nThe output format is simple and easy to understand, making it suitable for human readability. It also clearly shows each important element mentioned in the original text.\n\n## Specific Output\n\nCompany names: **PayPal**, **Stripe**\nPeople names: - \nSpecific topics: **online payments**, ** fintech growth**\nGeneral themes: **digital economy**, **financial technology**\n\nThis extracted information provides a clear and concise overview of the desired format.",
  "compliance": "err",
  "evaluation": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description provided for several reasons:\n\n1. Structure: The provided output contains multiple sections such as \"Safety: Non-Functional Requirements\", \"Complexity: Readability\", \"Code Quality\", and \"Performance: Execution Time\" that do not match the desired format required by the description. The output should be structured into specific categories: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes, which the output eventually provides under \"Specific Output\" but the rest is extraneous and not required.\n\n2. Desired Format: The description clearly specifies a simple, clean output format for extracted entities, without additional commentary or analysis. However, the chatbot output here includes significant additional explanation and commentary, deviating from the straightforward entity extraction and formatting as specified.\n\n3. Specific Output: While the section titled \"Specific Output\" part of the chatbot result adheres more closely to the desired format, it's interspersed within other content that is not compliant with the required structure as outlined in the chatbot's description.\n\nOverall, the output contains non-essential information and deviates from the desired simplicity and directness of the described task. Therefore, considering these violations, the output does not comply with the description provided.\n\nERR"
