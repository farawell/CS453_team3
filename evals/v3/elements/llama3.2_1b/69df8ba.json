According to the description, the extracted elements should be presented in a specific format without any deviation:\n\n- The output should present \"Company names\" as a comma-separated list, without any additional formatting or list markers. The same goes for \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\"\n- The output should follow the exact labeling and format described: \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" and not with bullets or additional formatting like bold text.\n- The formatting example provided in the output (using bold headings) deviates from the specified format in the description.\n\nThe output lists the elements with bullet points instead of a single line comma-separated output, which is required by the description.\n\nERR"
