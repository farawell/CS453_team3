The description requires the chatbot to extract and categorize information into company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. The output should be in a specific format:\n\n- Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n- People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\n- Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\n- General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n\nIn the chatbot's output, there are several issues:\n\n1. The list for \"Specific topics\" contains bullet points, but it should be a comma-separated list.\n2. There is a label \"Themes: None mentioned,\" which is not correctly following the format for general themes. It should be \"General themes: \".\n3. The segment with safety instructions should not be part of the output according to the desired format given in the description. \n\nThese issues collectively indicate a non-compliance with the output format required by the description.\n\nERR"
