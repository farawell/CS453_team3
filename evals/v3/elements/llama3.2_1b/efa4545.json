  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description provided. Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. The output should follow the desired format exactly as described, which includes listing \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes,\" each with a \"<comma_separated_list_of_values>\" format.\n   \n2. The \"Company names\" field is correctly labeled but uses \"None\" instead of a potential empty list or format compliance. However, without knowing the input, this can't be evaluated as a violation for content, only format.\n\n3. The \"People names\" field should follow the same \"<comma_separated_list_of_values>\" format but uses \"-||-\" instead, which does not match the expected format.\n\n4. The output for \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" follows the correct labeling but does not separate multiple entries with commas, not adhering strictly to the \"<comma_separated_list_of_values>\" format.\n\nBased on the format non-compliance, I conclude that:\n\nERR"
