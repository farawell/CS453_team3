  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output partially follows the desired format as outlined in the description. However, there are discrepancies:\n\n1. **Company Names Section**: The output lists a company name, which fits the expected \"comma_separated_list_of_company_names\". This complies with the format.\n\n2. **People Names Section**: The section states \"None mentioned,\" which deviates slightly from the requested format \"-||-\". While it conveys the absence of names, it doesnâ€™t adhere to the specified format.\n\n3. **Specific Topics Section**: This section correctly lists \"Strategic development,\" complying with the format \"-||-\".\n\n4. **General Themes Section**: This section correctly lists \"Discussion, development, strategies\" in a comma-separated format as expected.\n\nThe format described in the description should be consistently followed, and while the content might be correct, the formatting has specific expectations that weren't strictly adhered to, specifically in the \"People names\" section.\n\nERR"
