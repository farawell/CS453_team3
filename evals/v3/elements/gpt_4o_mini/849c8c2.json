  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description, which specifies a format that requires outputs for company names and people names. The output does not explicitly include a list for company names, leaving it blank without an indication that no company names were found. \n\nAdditionally, the description requires a specific \"comma_separated_list_of_company_names\" and \"People names: -||-\". While the description suggests using \"-||-\" for cases where applicable elements are absent, it is inconsistent in its application because the field for company names should follow a unified pattern that clearly indicates absence, not an empty space.\n\nSince these fields are not appropriately filled following the specified format, the output does not meet the compliance standards set by the description.\n\nERR"
