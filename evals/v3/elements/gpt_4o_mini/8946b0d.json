  "evaluation": "The chatbot output should follow the desired format specified in the description, which includes extracting \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" \n\n- **Company names** and **People names** fields are present in the output but left empty, which technically adheres to the format requirements since the format allows for empty fields if none are present in the input text.\n- The **Specific topics** and **General themes** are filled with values and adhere to the expected format with a comma-separated list.\n\nThe output adheres to the desired structure, maintaining the specified sections and format. Since the evaluation task states that we should focus only on format compliance and not on content correctness due to lack of input, my decision is based solely on the structure.\n\nOK"
