It correctly lists the extracted entities under the specified categories: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. Each category is clearly labeled, and the entries are separated by commas, adhering to the format of \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" and \"<comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\". There are no further violations as I am not checking for correctness. Overall, the output complies with the specified format and structure outlined in the chatbot's description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
