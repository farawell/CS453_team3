  "evaluation": "The chatbot output is not compliant with the desired format as detailed in the description. Specifically, the output must list entities in the specified categories even if those categories are empty. While the chatbot output includes placeholders for company and people names, it lacks the appropriate placeholder format (\"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" or \"-||-\") for these elements as specified in the description. Instead, it omits them entirely or leaves them blank, which indicates a deviation from the required output structure. Hence, the format with placeholders is missing in these categories.\n\nERR"
