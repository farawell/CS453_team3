  "evaluation": "The chatbot's output is evaluated against the description, which requires the extracted elements to be in a specific format:\n\n1. **Company names**: The output correctly lists company names in a comma-separated format.\n2. **People names**: The description requires a list of people names in a comma-separated format. Here, the placeholder \"-||-\" is used instead of an empty or comma-separated list indicating the presence or absence of people names.\n3. **Specific topics**: The output lists specific topics, fulfilling the requirement of a comma-separated format.\n4. **General themes**: The output lists general themes in the specified format.\n\nThe issue is with the placeholder \"-||-\" used incorrectly according to the description. The description does not specify the use of any placeholders and suggests a comma-separated list, which the output does not follow. Thus, this does not match the specified format for people names.\n\nTherefore, there is non-compliance with the desired format due to the use of a placeholder instead of a list.\n\nERR"
