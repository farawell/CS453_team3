According to the description, the chatbot should first extract company names, then people names, followed by specific topics, and finally general themes. The format should include \"Company names:\", \"People names:\", \"Specific topics:\", and \"General themes:\" with each extraction following in a comma-separated list format.\n\nIn the provided output:\n\n1. \"Company names:\" and \"People names:\" are followed by empty spaces, which implies that there were no company or people names extracted. This cannot be confirmed as correct or incorrect without the input, so this part of the format cannot be assessed for compliance.\n   \n2. The specific topics and general themes are given correctly in the requested format.\n\n3. However, there is extraneous text in the form of a Python comment. This does not align with the desired output format, which should strictly follow the outlined structure without any additional text or code.\n\nThus, the inclusion of extraneous text violates the requirement for strict adherence to the specified format.\n\nERR"
