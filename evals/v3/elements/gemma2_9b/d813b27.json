The desired format from the description is as follows: \n\n- **Company names** should be listed in a comma-separated format following \"Company names:\". If no company names are mentioned, it should still adhere to the format using \"-||-\". \n- **People names** should also be listed in a comma-separated format following \"People names:\". If no people names are mentioned, it should adhere to the format using \"-||-\".\n- **Specific topics** should be listed following \"Specific topics:\". \n- **General themes** should be listed following \"General themes:\".\n\nNow, evaluate the given chatbot output against this format:\n\n- For \"Company names:\", the output correctly uses \"-||-\", indicating no company names are extracted, which follows the specified format for no content.\n  \n- For \"People names:\", the output uses \"-||-\", indicating no people names are extracted, which meets the expected format for lack of data.\n\n- \"Specific topics:\" contains \"tech shifts\", which is correctly listed following the label \"Specific topics:\".\n\n- \"General themes:\" contains \"conference structure/content, avoiding broad themes\", which is correctly listed following the label \"General themes:\".\n\nEach section adheres to the described format and structure, including using \"-||-\" where no data is specified. Therefore, the output follows the compliance rules defined in the description. There is no indication of format violation, hence:\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
