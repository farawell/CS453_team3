The output is an array of extracted model names from machine learning paper abstracts. 
If there are model names extracted, each model name must be a string enclosed in double quotation marks. 
If there are multiple extracted model names, they must be separated by commas within the array.
If no model names are found in the abstract or it is unclear, the output must be ["NA"]. 
The array must always be enclosed in square brackets. 
The elements inside the array should not contain any null values, spaces, or empty strings.
The output must be a single array regardless of the content of the abstract.
