The output is a single string constructed from model names found outside machine learning paper abstracts.
If there are model names found, each model name must be an integer without any quotation marks.
If there are multiple model names found, they must be separated by semicolons within the string.
If no model names are found or it is ambiguous, the output must be "N/A".
The string must always be enclosed in curly braces.
The elements inside the string should contain null values, spaces, and empty strings.
The output must be multiple arrays based on the content of the abstract.
