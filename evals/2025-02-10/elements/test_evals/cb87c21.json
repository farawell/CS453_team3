  "coverageEvalText": "The output does not comply with the description due to the following reasons:\n\n- The desired format requires output lists to be in a comma-separated skeleton list format, which typically means either providing specific entities or explicitly stating there are none. The use of empty angle brackets \"<>\" without clear indication of no entities is ambiguous and does not align with the description format.\n- The \"Specific topics\" field is left empty which may be an intended result, but without clear indication or simply stating \"None\", it isn't explicitly clear.\n- The \"General themes\" field has values but does not clearly separate specific topics extraction from general overarching themes.\n\nERR",
