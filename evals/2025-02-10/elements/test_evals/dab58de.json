  "coverageEvalText": "The output does not comply with the description. The format required is a single line for each category, but the bot used angle brackets (\"<\" and \">\") instead of a comma-separated list. Specifically:\n\n- For \"Company names\", angle brackets were used around the names instead of commas only.\n- For \"People names\", similar misuse of angle brackets.\n- \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" are compliant assuming the text did not have any specific topics or general themes. However, knowing the input is essential to fully evaluate this part.\n\nERR",
