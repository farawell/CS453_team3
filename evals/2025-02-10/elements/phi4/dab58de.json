The output has only one name, but it is not followed by a comma.\n2. Company names should also be comma-separated. The output complies with this.\n3. Specific topics should also be comma-separated, which is correct in this case, but since there is only one specific topic listed, it cannot be clearly inferred.\n4. General themes are correctly comma-separated.\n\nGiven this, the output contains all required sections but violates the comma-separation rule for the 'People names' section.\n\nERR"
