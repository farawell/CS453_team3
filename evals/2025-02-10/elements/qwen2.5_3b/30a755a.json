  "output": "Company names: Meta Platforms Inc., formerly known as Facebook, Google LLC, Apple Inc.\nPeople names: Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook\nSpecific topics: data privacy, new initiative, innovative features, protecting user data\nGeneral themes: technology companies, privacy concerns, product updates",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output largely adheres to the desired format: it provides sections for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes, each as comma-separated lists. However, there's a notable deviation in the format for the \"Specific topics\" section where some items are written as phrases instead of singular topics as seen with \"new initiative\" and \"innovative features\". Nevertheless, since the clearer guideline suggests looking for non-compliance on described format and structure, the chatbot's comprehensive lists of entities and themes, divided accordingly, does fit into the format expected.\n\nOK"
