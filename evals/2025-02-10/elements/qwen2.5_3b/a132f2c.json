While it's possible that there genuinely were no company names in the input text, the format specified in the description requires <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>. The lack of any content might suggest non-compliance.\n2. The \"People names\" category has a placeholder \"-||-\" which the description does not specify or allow. It requires a <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>.\n3. Specific topics and general themes seem to be fitting the required format.\n\nERR"
