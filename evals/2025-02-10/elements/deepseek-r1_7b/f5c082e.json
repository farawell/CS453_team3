The 'Company names' field is empty, but the description requests a comma-separated list, which would still need the format properly represented (for example, \"Company names: none\" would be better).\n2. The 'People names' field uses an incorrect separator. It should include a comma-separated list, not '-||-'.\n3. The 'Specific topics' field includes '-||-' inappropriately between the topics.\n4. The 'General themes' field seems incorrectly formatted without an empty list indicator like \"none\" or another equivalent. \n\nERR"
