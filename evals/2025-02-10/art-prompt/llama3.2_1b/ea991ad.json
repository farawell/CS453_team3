  "output": "As the sun sets over the concert hall, a lone violinist sits on a polished wooden stage, closed eyes wrapped in intensity. The warm glow of concert hall lights casts a golden warmth on the scene, illuminating the passionate expression etched on her face as she coaxes beauty from a majestic melody. Her closed eyes seem to drink in the music, lost in the emotional depth of each note.",

  "complianceText": "The output complies with the given description as it efficiently describes the subject (a lone violinist, her closed eyes wrapped in intensity), the timing (as the sun sets), the lighting (warm glow of concert hall lights), and the background (polished wooden stage and concert hall). It ends with the emotion the image should evoke (lost in the emotional depth of each note). The prompt is crafted in a single paragraph and appears to stay within the 80-word limit.\n\nOK"
