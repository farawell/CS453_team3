  "input": "A group of children flying kites on a clear, sunny day in an open field, surrounded by wildflowers. The sky is a bright blue with a few white clouds scattered across it. The photo should capture a sense of joy, freedom, and timeless simplicity associated with childhood.",
  "output": "In the golden light of a cloudless summer morning, a rainbow-hued kite soaring high above a verdant field bathed in warm sunlight, the children's laughter and faces aglow like tiny sunrises. Seated at the base, arms wrapped protectively around fluttering kites, their eyes shining with unbridled excitement as they twirl and dance on the breeze amidst an explosion of wildflowers swaying in gentle harmony with nature.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The output is a single paragraph, and it describes the subjects (children), their characteristics (laughter, faces aglow, eyes shining), the timing and lighting (golden light of a cloudless summer morning, warm sunlight), and the background (verdant field, wildflowers). It also conveys the feeling the image should evoke (excitement, harmony with nature). The description is vivid and detailed, and it is within 80 words.\n\nOK"
