  "output": "In a dimly lit rural barn, under the glow of a full moon, a black cat sits atop a sprawling pumpkin, its glowing yellow eyes gleaming like miniature suns. Carved in intricate detail on the gourd face is a raven's head, as if beckoning trick-or-treaters closer to the rustic wooden porch, where flickering candles cast eerie shadows upon the weathered planks. As the cat shifts restlessly beneath the pumpkin, its eyes seem to hold a mischievous spark, inviting all who dare approach into this witching hour of Halloween night.",

The description appears to be concise, engaging, and within the word limit.\n\nOK"
