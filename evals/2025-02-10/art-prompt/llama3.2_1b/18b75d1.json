  "output": "\"As the late afternoon sun casts a warm glow through the window blinds, softly illuminating the cozy reading nook of the local library, our protagonist, a bespectacled librarian, sits amidst a stack of books, glasses perched on the end of her nose, her serene expression conveying a sense of quiet contemplation. The diffused light reveals the subtle creases on her skin as she lost in thought, surrounded by the musty scent of old paper and the gentle hum of whispering patrons.\"",

It describes the subject (a bespectacled librarian), timing and lighting (late afternoon sun casting a warm glow), the background (local library, cozy reading nook, stack of books), and the feeling evoked (quiet contemplation and serene expression). However, it does not explicitly conclude with the feeling the image should evoke, even though it is implied.\n\nERR"
