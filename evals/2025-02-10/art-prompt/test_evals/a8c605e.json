  "inverse": true,
  "input": "A lone tree in the middle of a snow-covered field at dusk. The photo should evoke an emotionless and detached feel.",
  "validityText": "The input description complies with several aspects of the input specification such as focusing on the subject ('a lone tree') and its characteristic ('middle of a snow-covered field at dusk'), and conveying the feeling the image should evoke (emotionless and detached feel). However, there are several issues:\n\nThe input does not mention the lighting in detail; while it references 'dusk', this doesn't fully cover the lighting specifics needed as described in the input specification. Also, it does not describe the background and setting in detail; only stating that it is in the middle of a snow-covered field lacks precise imagery. Additionally, the word count is less than 80 words, which could be more descriptive.\n\nERR",

  "coverageText": "A solitary tree stands stark in the center of a vast, snow-blanketed field as dusk's last light fades. The setting sun casts long, cold shadows, with dim blue and purple hues washing over the landscape. The sky is overcast, with a heavy blanket of clouds melding seamlessly into the distant treeline. The image should evoke a sense of stillness and profound detachment, conveying an atmosphere of isolation and emotional numbness.",
  "coverageEvalText": "The output provided by the chatbot adheres to the guidelines for creating a detailed AI photo prompt. It describes the subject (a solitary tree), follows with information about the timing and lighting (dusk, setting sun, long shadows, blue and purple hues), and then moves to the background (overcast sky, heavy clouds, distant treeline). Finally, it conveys the intended feeling (stillness, detachment, isolation, numbness). The description is concise, within the word limit, and crafted in a single paragraph.\n\nOK",
