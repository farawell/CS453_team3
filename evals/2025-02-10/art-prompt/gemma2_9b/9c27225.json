  "output": "A solitary guitarist with tousled hair sits cross-legged before a crackling bonfire on a moonlit sandy beach. His fingers dance across the strings of his acoustic guitar, casting flickering shadows on his face illuminated by the warm orange glow of the fire and the ethereal silver light of the full moon. Gentle waves lap at the shore behind him, creating a soothing backdrop to his soulful melody.  The atmosphere is one of quiet intimacy and deep contemplation.   \n",
