  "input": "An artist deeply engrossed in painting a beautiful sunset on a large canvas set up in front of an old lighthouse by the sea. Waves crash against the rocky shore, and the sky is a blend of pinks, oranges, and purples. The image should feel calming and inspirational.",
  "output": "A weathered artist, consumed by his brushstrokes, captures the breathtaking hues of a sunset upon a colossal canvas positioned before an ancient lighthouse overlooking the tempestuous sea. Waves surge against jagged rocks as fiery pinks, luminous oranges, and ethereal purples ignite the twilight sky.  Soft golden light bathes the scene in a warm glow, casting long shadows that dance across the rough-hewn canvas and cobblestone. Exuding a tranquil aura of artistry and serenity, the image should inspire awe and a sense of profound peace. \n\n\n",
