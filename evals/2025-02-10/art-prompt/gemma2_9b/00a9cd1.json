  "output": "A valiant knight, clad in shining armor, stands silhouetted against the first blush of dawn in a dense, mist-shrouded forest. His weathered face is etched with determination as he gazes into the swirling mist, his sword held loosely at his side. A golden light pierces through the fog, illuminating the dew-laden leaves and casting long shadows that dance around him. The air hangs heavy with anticipation, whispering secrets of an ancient world hidden beneath the veil of morning mist.   The image should exude a sense of courageous mystery. \n",

  "complianceText": "The output meets the requirement of being a single, detailed paragraph describing the subjects (valiant knight), their characteristics (clad in shining armor, weathered face, sword), the timing (first blush of dawn), lighting (golden light piercing the fog), and the background (mist-shrouded forest, dew-laden leaves). It also conveys a feeling (courageous mystery). However, the word count is likely over 80 words.\n\nERR"
