  "input": "A ballet dancer performing on an empty stage with spotlight focused. The image should evoke grace and elegance.",
  "output": "Capture a ballet dancer centered on a sparse, empty stage bathed in soft, warm gold light from a single overhead spotlight that highlights their delicate features and fluid lines, casting gentle shadows across the rest of the stage. This stark contrast showcases the dancer's elegant pose, perhaps a poised arabesque or graceful pirouette, with elongated limbs exuding poise against the simplicity of the background. The composition should evoke an atmosphere of quiet grace and refined elegance, suggesting both movement frozen in time and the ethereal beauty of dance, allowing viewers to feel the silent music and emotion embodied in this solitary moment.",
