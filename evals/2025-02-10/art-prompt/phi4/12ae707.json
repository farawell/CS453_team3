  "input": "A street artist painting a mural on a busy city wall, with the sun setting behind skyscrapers. The photo should feel vibrant and full of life.",
  "output": "Capture a talented street artist energetically brushing broad strokes across a vividly designed mural cascading down a bustling city wall. Painted colors, rich in hues like electric blue, sunset orange, radiant green, and purples blend seamlessly, as the artist's focused expression illuminates their dedication. The setting sun sends golden rays slicing over silhouetted skyscrapers behind them, casting elongated shadows to add depth while bathing the scene in a warm, ambient glow; daylight blends with twilight to enhance the mural’s brightness against the urban backdrop. Streetlamps begin to flicker on, reflecting off wet cobblestones. Passersby are captured in mid-motion—joggers, cyclists, and dog walkers—all adding life as they blur past in varying speeds. The feeling of urban dynamism is palpable: an atmosphere buzzing with spontaneous serendipity, echoing the city’s pulse at sunset.",
