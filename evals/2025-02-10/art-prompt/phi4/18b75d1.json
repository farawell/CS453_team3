  "output": "Create an image featuring a librarian standing beside a well-organized stack of aged books. The librarian wears classic spectacles that rest gently on the tip of their nose, exuding serenity with a soft, focused expression. Position them in late afternoon light, where sunbeams filter through gauzy curtains, casting a cozy glow around. This scene unfolds within a warm, inviting reading nook filled with plush cushions and rich hardwood tones. Let this setting evoke a profound sense of calm and intellectual curiosity, as if readers here are lost in worlds penned by timeless authors.",
