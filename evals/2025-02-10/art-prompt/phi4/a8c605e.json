  "input": "A lone tree in the middle of a snow-covered field at dusk. The photo should evoke an emotionless and detached feel.",
  "output": "Capture a solitary, gnarled tree casting long shadows against a vast, snow-blanketed field as dusk transitions to night, with muted purples and grays dominating the horizon sky. Surrounding the stark tree are subtle undulations in the snow, hinting at unseen forces yet maintaining an eerie calmness. The lighting is minimalistic, offering just enough luminescence from a distant setting sun to outline textures without warmth or color vibrancy, intensifying the sense of isolation and indifference that permeates the scene.",

  "complianceText": "The output is within a single paragraph and does not exceed 80 words. It covers the subject (a solitary, gnarled tree), its characteristics (casting long shadows, surrounded by subtle undulations in the snow), the timing (dusk transitioning to night), the lighting (minimalistic, luminescence from a distant setting sun), the background (vast, snow-blanketed field, muted purples and grays dominating the horizon sky), and the feeling (sense of isolation and indifference). There are no violations of the given description based on the text provided.\n\nOK"
