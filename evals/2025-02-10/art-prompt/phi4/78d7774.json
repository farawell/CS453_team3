  "input": "An astronaut floating in the vastness of space, surrounded by the stars. The image should invoke thoughtfulness and the infinity of the universe.",
  "output": "Capture an astronaut adrift gracefully in a cosmic ballet within the boundless arena of deep space, where Earth is a distant blue orb among twinkling stars and drifting planets. Ensure the lighting highlights the astronaut's suit with sharp contrasts, using starlight as the primary light source to cast delicate shadows that emphasize their isolation and purposeful exploration. Use blackness punctuated by celestial bodies and solar arrays to suggest unexplored frontiers. Aim for a feeling of serene wonderâ€”eliciting deep thoughtfulness and a profound connection to the infinite expanse of the universe, highlighting both human ingenuity and cosmic mystery.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is within the 80-word limit and constructed as a single paragraph. The description also follows the guidelines by focusing on the subject (astronaut), detailing the characteristics (adrift, gracefully, cosmic ballet), timing and lighting (sharp contrasts, starlight), and describing the background (Earth as a distant blue orb, twinkling stars, drifting planets, blackness punctuated by celestial bodies and solar arrays). It concludes with the feeling the image should evoke (serene wonder, deep thoughtfulness, profound connection). All criteria are satisfied.\n\nOK"
