  "output": "Focus on an elderly fisherman with a weathered, introspective face, standing by the water's edge holding his trusty fishing rod. Capture this scene in the early hours of morning when the world is just waking up, basked in misty, soft light that drapes over him and the surroundings, adding a dreamlike quality to the image. The background features a vast, tranquil lake with gentle ripples on its surface reflecting the muted colors of dawn, perhaps with tall trees softly outlined by the fog at the water's edge. Aim for the photo to radiate a profound sense of peace and solitude, inviting viewers into this serene moment as nature quietly unfolds around a single soul engaged in timeless simplicity.",
