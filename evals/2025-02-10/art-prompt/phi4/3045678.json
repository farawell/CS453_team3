  "output": "Imagine a young woman seated comfortably in a plush armchair. Her posture is effortlessly relaxed as she gently holds an open book to her chest, brows lowered with concentration, and eyes scanning the pages. The scene is set during early evening when shadows subtly lengthen across the room. Soft indoor lighting creates a warm glow that bathes her face softly, highlighting expressions of peace and intellectual engagement. Behind her surrounds a cozy environment brimming with bookshelves meticulously stacked to their edges, hinting at countless adventures within reach. The atmosphere in this space is serene, inviting introspection and wonder, as if the reader has been invited into an intimate conversation with another world through literature.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output follows the guidelines by creating a detailed and vivid description that paints a clear picture of the scene. The subject and their characteristics are well-described (a young woman, relaxed posture, holding a book), timing and lighting are covered (early evening, soft indoor lighting), the background is clearly outlined (cozy environment with bookshelves), and the feeling of the image is conveyed (serenity, introspection, wonder). The description is written in a single paragraph and seems to be within 80 words length limit.\n\nOK"
