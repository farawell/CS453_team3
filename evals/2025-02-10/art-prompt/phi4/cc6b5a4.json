  "output": "Capture an artist deeply focused on painting an enchanting sunset on a large canvas positioned before an aged, rustic lighthouse by a serene sea. The waves rhythmically crash against the weathered rocks of the shore as the sky glows with a mesmerizing mix of pinks, oranges, and purples. Frame this scene at twilight to enhance the warm light reflecting over the artist's brush strokes and in their thoughtful expression. Surroundings include the lighthouse in stoic silence and the dynamic sea, both bathed in golden hues, creating an image that radiates a sense of calm and inspiration.",
