  "output": "A lone majestic tree stands in the heart of a snow-covered field at dusk. The soft golden glow of dawn casts long shadows across the snow, creating a sense of depth and calmness. With no distractions to speak of except the vastness of the plain stretching endlessly beyond the frame, the image conveys an emotionless detachment as if the spectator is detached from the scene, observing it with cold precision.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description because there are two issues identified: \n\n1. The description should focus first on the subjects and their characteristics, the subjects here are missing detailed characteristics about the \"lone majestic tree.\"\n2. The word count seems excessive at 77 words, and the details spread across a longer narrative, possibly including excessive detail about the \"vastness of the plain\" and looks like it exceeds the 80-word limit described in the prompt.\n\nERR"
