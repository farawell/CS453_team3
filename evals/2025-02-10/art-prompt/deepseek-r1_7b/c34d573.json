  "output": "A serene lake in the early morning mist, reflecting a calm sky and peaceful horizon. Afisherman tilts his white net as he fishes in the water, his stooped posture casting shadows across the surface. Birds soar overhead, flying silently over the vast expanse above, their wings shimmering with light. The smoke of burning wood rises from theDistance, blending with the scene's organic life and quiet dynamism. A moment of anticipation precedes the day's catch as the sun begins to rise, casting dappled shadows across the water and birds in the distance. The image evokes a sense of timeless serenity and promise within the changing light and movement of this early morning scene.",
  "compliance": "err",
  "complianceText": "The output is too long and seems to exceed 80 words, breaching the word limit rule. It also includes a few extraneous or overly descriptive elements that could have been condensed to fit within the limit, while still preserving artistic impact. Another issue is the typo with \"afisherman\" instead of \"a fisherman\" and “theDistance” instead of “the distance”. These errors suggest a lack of proofreading.\n\nERR"
