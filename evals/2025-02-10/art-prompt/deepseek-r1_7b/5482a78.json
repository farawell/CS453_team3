  "output": "It seems thereâ€™s some confusion in your request. To generate effective AI photo prompts, you can follow this structured approach:\n\n1. **Subjects:** Start by clearly defining the main subject or object of the image (e.g., \"a grandmother baking cookies\").\n2. **Characteristics:** Describe unique features or attributes of the subject (e.g., \"kind smile\", \"flour-dusted hands\").\n3. **Timing and Lighting:** Specify the time of day and the lighting conditions (e.g., \"afternoon\", \"warm kitchen light\").\n4. **Background:** Mention any relevant background elements (e.g., \"cozy kitchen with a wooden table\").\n5. **Feeling Evoked:** Indicate the emotional or sensory experience you want to convey (e.g., \"warmth and tradition\").\n\nApplying this structure ensures consistency, clarity, and coherence in your prompts for generating impactful AI-generated images. Let me know if you'd like help refining any of these elements!",

  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the description. The chatbot provides a structured guide on how to generate effective AI photo prompts rather than transforming user descriptions into detailed prompts for generating AI photos. It breaks down the approach into multiple points instead of crafting a single paragraph. Additionally, the content exceeds the 80-word limit and does not follow the specified format of focusing on subjects, characteristics, timing, lighting, background, and the feeling evoked in a cohesive, singular paragraph.\n\nERR"
