Can include multiple sentences, and the length of the news article text can be variable.\n5. All types of greetings should be ignored but are valid inputs.\n\nUpon careful examination, the input \"Latest in the business sector\" is in English and seems to refer to the Business category. However, the input does not provide enough context or additional information to classify it solidly into the Business category. It does not resemble a news article text (i.e., it should include more substantive content).\n\nERR",
