Therefore, the part of speech tag for \"discovered\" is VB (Verb, base form). When considering it specifically in past tense, in some POS tagging systems like Penn Treebank, it would be VBD.

However, it concludes with a tag of \"VB\" which stands for Verb, base form, instead of \"VBD\" for past tense verb. Additionally, the explanation in the output is not required and contradicts the instruction to provide only the part of speech tag.\n\nERR"
