In \"I am going to the market,\" the word \"to\" is used as a preposition indicating direction toward a specific place (the market).\n\nIn this context, \"to\" serves as one of those words that introduces a prepositional phrase (\"to the market\").

The output \"TO\" is provided; however, the subsequent explanation indicates that the correct tag for \"to\" in the sentence \"I am going to the market\" should be \"IN\" (Preposition or subordinating conjunction). The description specifies that only the tag should be provided, and the listed tag appears inconsistent with the explanation.\n\nERR"
