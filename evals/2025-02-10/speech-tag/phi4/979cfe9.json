However, as both could technically apply based on limited context, VB is provided first due to typical format conventions starting with the base form.\n\nVB (base or infinitive)  \nVBD (past tense)  \n\nGiven no conflicting indications of it needing a specific past tense identification over general verb form recognition, both are possible.",

The description requires a single tag to be returned or a specific response ('Unknown' or 'CantAnswer'). The presence of multiple tags and a detailed contextual explanation violates the guideline to return only the tag.\n\nERR"
