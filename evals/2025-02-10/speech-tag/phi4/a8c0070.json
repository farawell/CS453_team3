  "output": "NN  \nNN  \n\nStep 1: Identify the target phrase or clause in each sentence:\n- In both provided sentences, \"The sky is blue,\" we notice that the word \"sky\" is functioning as a noun. It names an entity.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the structure surrounding the word \"sky\":\n- The definite article \"The\" directly precedes \"sky,\" which indicates that \"sky\" should be treated as a singular, common noun.\n- There is no pluralization or possessive form applied to \"sky\" in these sentences. \n\nStep 3: Determine the part of speech:\n- Based on standard English grammar rules, nouns are words used to identify people, places, things, or ideas.\n- According to the list given for part-of-speech tags:\n  - NN stands for Noun, singular or mass.\n\nStep 4: Confirm that \"sky\" in this sentence is best categorized under the listed part-of-speech tag of NN:\n- Since \"sky\" fits the description of a singular noun and does not appear in any other grammatical form (such as plural or possessive) within these sentences, it aligns with the definition of NN: Noun, singular or mass.\n\nStep 5: Reassess to ensure no other tags apply:\n- The tags for determiners (DT), adjectives (JJ), verbs (VB/VBD/VBG/etc.), and others do not fit \"sky\" in this context.\n- No indicators suggest that the word should be considered a proper noun (NNP/NNPS), foreign word (FW), numeral (CD), or any other category.\n\nStep 6: Conclusion for both sentences:\n- Given no deviation from the expected singular noun use and following the rules outlined above, we determine \"sky\" in these sentences is tagged as NN.\n- Since there is no change in context between the two identical sentences, the determination of NN applies uniformly to both instances of the word \"sky.\"",
