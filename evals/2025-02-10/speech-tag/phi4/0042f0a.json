  "output": "RB: Adverb  \nRBS: Adjective, superlative\n\nGiven that \"gracefully\" in this context functions as an adverb modifying the verb \"danced,\" the appropriate part of speech is RB (Adverb). \n\nIf you had to select one tag for simplicity and clarity:\n- Tag: RB\n- Explanation: The word \"gracefully\" modifies the verb by describing how she danced. In English, words that modify verbs in such a way are adverbs.\n\nThe RBS tag (Adjective, superlative) does not apply here because \"gracefully\" is not being used as an adjective, nor is it in its superlative form. It functions specifically to describe the manner of action. \n\nThus, RB is the primary and correct part-of-speech tag for \"gracefully\" in this context.",

The description specifies that only the part of speech tag should be returned. Therefore, the output should have only \"RB\" and not the explanation or additional tags.\n\nERR"
