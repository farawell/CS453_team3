- Prompt Under Test (PUT) - like Program Under Test; the prompt
- Model Under Test (MUT) - Model which we are testing against with specific temperature, etc example: gpt-4o-mini
- Model Used by PromptPex (MPP) - gpt-4o

- Input Specification (IS) - Extracting input constraints of PUT using MPP
- Output Rules (OR) - Extracting output constraints of PUT using MPP
- Output Rules Groundedness (ORG) - Checks if OR is grounded in PUT using MPP

- Prompt Under Test Intent (PUTI) - Extracting the exact task from PUT using MMP

- PromptPex Tests (PPT) - Test cases generated for PUT with MPP using IS and OR
- Baseline Tests (BT) - Zero shot test cases generated for PUT with MPP

- Test Input Compliance (TIC) - Checking if PPT and BT meets the constraints in IS using MPP
- Test Coverage (TC) - Result generated for PPT and BT on PUTI + OR with MPP

- Test Output (TO) - Result generated for PPT and BT on PUT with each MUT
- Test Output ComplianceÂ (TOC) - Checking if TO meets the constraints in PUT using MPP

|phi4||sentence: He laughed at the joke\. word: laughed|VB  <br>VBD  <br>The context of "laughed" as "He laughed at the joke\." suggests that it is in the past tense, referring to an action completed by the subject "He\." Without additional context implying non\-3rd person singular present, the more appropriate tag would be VBD\. However, as both could technically apply based on limited context, VB is provided first due to typical format conventions starting with the base form\.<br><br>VB \(base or infinitive\)  <br>VBD \(past tense\)  <br><br>Given no conflicting indications of it needing a specific past tense identification over general verb form recognition, both are possible\.|err|
|phi4||sentence: She has been running every morning\. word: running|VBG<br><br>Given the sentence "She has been running every morning\." and the word "running," we need to determine its part of speech\.<br><br>1\. \*\*Analyze the Sentence Structure\*\*:<br>   \- "She" is a personal pronoun \(PRP\)\.<br>   \- "has been" indicates a verb phrase in the present perfect continuous tense\.<br>   \- "running" follows "has been," indicating it is part of the continuous aspect of the verb phrase\.<br><br>2\. \*\*Determine Part of Speech for "running"\*\*:<br>   \- The word "running" is derived from the base form "run\."<br>   \- In the context provided, "running" serves as a present participle to indicate an ongoing action associated with the verb phrase\.<br>   \- Present participles often end in "\-ing\."<br><br>3\. \*\*Tag according to the list of part\-of\-speech tags\*\*:<br>   \- From the list: <br>     \- VBG stands for Verb, gerund or present participle\.<br><br>Given this analysis, "running" serves as a verb in its present participle form here\.<br><br>Therefore, the part of speech tag for "running" is \*\*VBG\*\*\.|err|
|phi4||sentence: The cat's fur was soft and shiny\. word: cat's|NN$  <br>\- "cat's" is a possessive form of the noun "cat," so it receives the tag for Noun, singular \(NN\) with a Possessive ending \($\) making it NN$\.  <br>\- In compound words like "cat's," "cat" is the main component identified as a noun\. The apostrophe followed by an "s" signifies possession, which in tagging corresponds with a possessive form\.|err|
|phi4||sentence: We are going to the concert tonight\. word: tonight|RB<br><br>The word "tonight" is used as an adverb in this sentence, indicating when the concert will take place\. Therefore, its part of speech tag is RB \(Adverb\)\.|err|
|phi4||sentence: The scientist discovered a new element\. word: discovered|VB  <br>In the sentence "The scientist discovered a new element," the word "discovered" is used as a verb in its past tense form, indicating an action performed by the subject \("the scientist"\)\. Therefore, the part of speech tag for "discovered" is VB \(Verb, base form\)\. When considering it specifically in past tense, in some POS tagging systems like Penn Treebank, it would be VBD\. However, according to the tags provided here, we're focusing on its basic verb category as VB\.<br><br>VB|err|

|phi4||sentence: His way of speaking is quite unique\. word: unique|JJ  <br>\(Adjective\)  <br><br>In the sentence "His way of speaking is quite unique," the word "unique" functions as an adjective describing how his way of speaking is distinctive or unusual\. The adverb "quite" modifies this adjective, emphasizing its uniqueness\. <br><br>\*\*Breakdown:\*\*<br><br>\- \*\*Subject:\*\* "His way of speaking"<br>  \- Noun phrase acting as the subject<br>  \- "Way" \(NN\) â singular noun<br>  \- Possessive pronoun "his" <br>  \- Prepositional phrase modifying "way": "of speaking"<br><br>\- \*\*Linking Verb:\*\* "is"<br>  \- Form of the verb "to be," connecting the subject to its complement<br><br>\- \*\*Adjective Complement:\*\* "quite unique"<br>  \- Provides a descriptive quality about "His way of speaking"  <br><br>Thus, in this context and its structure, "unique" is appropriately tagged as JJ \(adjective\)\.|err|
