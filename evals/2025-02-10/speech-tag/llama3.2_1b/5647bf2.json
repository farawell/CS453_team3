According to the description, the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag or specific responses like \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer.\" Here, the first line \"cc: ADJ\" is not a valid part of speech tag, and it includes additional characters \"cc:\" which are not compliant with the requirement of returning just the tag. The second line \"cc: ADJ\" repeats the same non-compliant pattern and is also incorrect. The third line \"can'tAnswer\" is close but does not match the correct case of \"CantAnswer\" as specified in the description.\n\nERR"
