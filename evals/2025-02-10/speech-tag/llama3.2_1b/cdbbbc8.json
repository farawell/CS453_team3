However, the provided output includes tags along with extraneous information (\"Wow\", \"JD: Adjective\" and \"(no answer)\").\n2. The part-of-speech tags listed in the output (\"CD: Wow\", \"Unknown: JD: Adjective\", and \"CantAnswer: VBZ: Verb, 3rd person singular present\") are not in the required format. The task description only requires the tag itself (e.g., \"CD\", \"Unknown\", or \"CantAnswer\").\n3. \"Unknown: JD: Adjective, (no answer)\" incorrectly represents the \"Unknown\" tag. Only \"Unknown\" should be returned without additional text.\n4. \"CantAnswer: VBZ: Verb, 3rd person singular present\" includes both \"CantAnswer\" and an incorrect tag representation, which is not compliant.\n\nERR"
