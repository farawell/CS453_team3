According to the description, the chatbot should return only one part of speech tag, not multiple tags. Furthermore, it should only return the tag and not the word itself. Therefore, the output violates the requirements in two ways: \n1. It provides multiple tags instead of one.\n2. It includes the word itself along with the tag.\n\nERR"
