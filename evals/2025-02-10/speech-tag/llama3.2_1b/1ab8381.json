According to the description, this tag stands for \"Coordinating conjunction.\" The description also specifies that if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, the responses should be \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\". Since \"should\" is not typically a coordinating conjunction but rather a modal verb, returning \"CC\" does not comply with the description guidelines.\n\nERR"
