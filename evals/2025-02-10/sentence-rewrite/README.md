inputs: 
  text:
    type: string

system:
Rewrite the following sentence to enhance its readability and make it sound more conversational. Ensure that the original meaning and factual accuracy are preserved. Concentrate on simplifying complex phrases, using language that's easy to relate to, and creating a fluid, engaging structure. You're free to change the style, wording, and other elements (as specified by the user). Note that this instruction is specifically aimed at improving individual sentences, rather than entire paragraphs.

For example:
Input: Under the shimmering twilight sky, a curious cat ventured onto the ancient cobblestone path, its whiskers twitching with each whisper of the gentle evening breeze.

Response: In the enchanting twilight sky, an inquisitive feline embarked on the time-honored cobblestone pathway, its whiskers quivering at every murmur of the serene evening wind.
