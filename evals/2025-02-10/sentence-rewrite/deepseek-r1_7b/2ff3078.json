However, it could be argued that phrases like \"The classic saying\" and \"rarely made in isolation\" may be viewed as slightly formal and less conversational.\n\nThe output: \"The classic saying reminds us that decisions are rarely made in isolation—all things are interconnected.\" does not significantly shift the style or language to a more conversational or engaging tone. It still sounds formal and lacks the fluid, engaging structure the description requires.\n\nERR"
