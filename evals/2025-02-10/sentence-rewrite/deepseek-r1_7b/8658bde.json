It maintains readability and simplifies the idea that one should not judge a book by its cover in a relaxed manner. This fits the requirement of creating a fluid, engaging structure using easy-to-relate language, and it preserves the original meaning. Since the input is not given, we focus on compliance with required conversational style.\n\nOK"
