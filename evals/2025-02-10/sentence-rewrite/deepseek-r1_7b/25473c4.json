However, since these checks require knowing the input and cannot be verified directly, we will ignore them.\n\nThe sentence provided by the chatbot is clear, uses simple language, and flows well, which matches the instructions to simplify complex phrases and use language that's easy to relate to. The structure is fluid and engaging.\n\nOK"
