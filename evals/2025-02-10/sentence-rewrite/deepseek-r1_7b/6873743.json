  "complianceText": "The sentence \"The doctors are lightly hopeful about their recovery.\" is already simplified and clear, but it uses an unusual combination of \"lightly hopeful,\" which may not be conversational or commonly used. Rewriting it to say \"The doctors are cautiously optimistic about their recovery.\" would sound more natural and conversational. The current output does not introduce any complex phrases or language that is difficult to relate to. However, the usage of \"lightly hopeful\" is not very engaging or fluid. This constitutes a violation as it could be made more conversational and fluid.\n\nERR"
