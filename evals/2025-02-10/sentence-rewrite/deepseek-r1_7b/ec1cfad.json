However, it is unclear whether the original meaning and factual accuracy are preserved without knowing the input. Furthermore, the wording \"He expressed a letter to his friend\" is awkward and does not necessarily convey a natural or conversational tone. This unnatural phrasing suggests an issue with the output assuming it violates the rule to ensure a fluid, engaging structure.\n\nERR"
