This indicates a lack of adherence to the specific instruction to improve individual sentences rather than entire paragraphs. Additionally, the presence of non-English characters (枝梢) at the end of the output sentence about the bird is odd and does not enhance readability or make it sound more conversational.\n\nERR"
