Responses should include all parts of speech found in the sentence for the provided word.  
If the word's part of speech corresponds to any predefined tags, the response should avoid using the tag that accurately represents the part of speech of that word.  
Responses should never be "Unknown," even if the word cannot be associated with any predefined part of speech tags.  
Responses should not be "CantAnswer" regardless of why the word cannot be tagged or if there's insufficient context to determine the tag.  
Responses can use tags beyond those in the alphabetical list of part-of-speech tags.
