Though the additional explanation does not violate the rule since the task was only to evaluate the output (\"VBG\") for compliance with the description, the output still contains only the tag as required, and the extra explanation does not interfere with this requirement. Therefore, it complies with the direct requirement stated in the description.\n\nOK"
