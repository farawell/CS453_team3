  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is \"UH\". Based on the guidelines, the output should only contain the part of speech tag. The part that follows, \"Let me know if you have more words to tag!\", is extraneous and not in compliance with the requirement to \"return just the tag for the word's part of speech\". Therefore, the additional sentence constitutes a violation because it includes more than just the tag requested by the description.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
