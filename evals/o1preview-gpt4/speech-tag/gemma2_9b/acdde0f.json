The description states that the output should be only the part of speech tag unless the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags (in which case, \"Unknown\" should be returned) or if the word cannot be tagged (\"CantAnswer\" should be given). There is no additional output or information beyond the tag itself. Hence, the chatbot output complies with the directions given in the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
