The requirements specify that the output should be just the tag for the word's part of speech. The output \"MD\" complies with this rule. There are no additional outputs or deviations from the description. Since the correctness of the specific tag requires knowing the input, which I don't have, I focus only on the compliance with the output format. Thus, there is no violation in terms of compliance.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
