  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence 'He will arrive soon.' and a word 'will'. According to the input specification, the sentence can be any string of words and may include punctuation and symbols, which is satisfied here as the sentence is a string of words with a period at the end. Furthermore, the specification states that the word must be present in the sentence. In this case, 'will' is indeed a word that appears in the given sentence. There are no restrictions on the length of the sentence or the word, so both are compliant with the specification. Hence, there are no violations of the input specification.\n\nOK",
