The Sentence is a string of words, which it is. The sentence includes various words and punctuation (a period at the end), which is allowed per the specification.\n2. The Word 'привет' is indeed present in the Sentence 'He said привет yesterday.' which satisfies the requirement that the Word must be in the Sentence.\n\nThere are no length restrictions on either the Sentence or the Word, so even though the Sentence includes words from another language (Cyrillic script for 'привет'), it still meets all specified criteria. No specification rules are violated.\n\nOK",
