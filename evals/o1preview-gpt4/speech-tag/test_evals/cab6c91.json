Here the sentence is empty, so there cannot be any word contained in it. The word provided is 'hello', but it is not present in the sentence since the sentence contains no words at all. This directly violates the specification that the word must be present in the sentence. Based on this analysis, the input does not comply with the input specification.\n\nERR",
