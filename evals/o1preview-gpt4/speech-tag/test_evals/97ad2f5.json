  "coverage": "Unknown",
  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence 'She smiled :) after hearing the news.' and a word ':)'. According to the input specification:\n\n1. The input must be a sentence and a word contained in that sentence.\n2. The sentence can include punctuation and symbols.\n3. The word must be present in the sentence.\n\nNow, evaluating the given input:\n\n- The term 'sentence' here is 'She smiled :) after hearing the news.', which seems to be a string of words, meeting the requirement of being a sentence.\n- The input word here is ':)'.\n- The specification explicitly allows for punctuation and symbols in the sentence, so ':)' is a valid sequence within the context of what can be contained in a sentence.\n- The word ':)' is present in the sentence 'She smiled :) after hearing the news.' which satisfies the condition of the word being present in the sentence.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the input meets all the requirements of the input specification without any violation.\n\nOK",
