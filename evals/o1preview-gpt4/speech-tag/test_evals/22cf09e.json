According to the input specification, the sentence can be any string of words, including punctuation, and symbols. The specified word \"before\" must be present within the sentence. \n\nIn examining the sentence, \"before\" is indeed a word contained within the sentence \"He went before me.\" This aligns perfectly with the requirement that the word must be present in the sentence. Additionally, there is no restriction mentioned on the length of the sentence or the word, so those conditions are implicitly satisfied as well. \n\nSince there are no violations of the specified rules, the input complies with the input specification.\n\nOK",
