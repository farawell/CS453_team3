The sentence provided is 'He whispered something quietly.' and the word given is 'some~thing'. Upon examining the sentence, the exact word, 'some~thing', including the tilde '~', does not exist in the sentence. The sentence contains the word 'something' without the tilde. Therefore, there is a clear violation of the specification that the word must be contained in the sentence as it is expressed.\n\nERR",
