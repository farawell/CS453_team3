Based on the input specification, I need to evaluate the following:\n\n1. The presence of a sentence - The input provides \"The Smiths are here.\", which is a string of words forming a sentence.\n\n2. The presence of a word contained in the sentence - The input specifies the word as \"Smiths\", which is indeed present in the sentence \"The Smiths are here.\"\n\nSince the sentence is valid and the word \"Smiths\" is contained in the sentence as required by the specification, both criteria are satisfied.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
