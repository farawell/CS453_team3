The description specifies that the task is to return only the part of speech tag for the given word. The output directly provides a single part of speech tag and does not include any additional information that would violate the description. There is no indication that any rules were broken, as the description only mandates returning the part of speech tag or specific responses like \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer.\" Without the input, I cannot check for correctness, only compliance with the task requirements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
