As per the guidelines, the chatbot should return \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags. Since there are no tags listed in the output other than \"Unknown,\" it complies with the requirement to only return a part of speech tag or specific responses like \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\". The output follows the rule of providing a direct response in the expected format.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
