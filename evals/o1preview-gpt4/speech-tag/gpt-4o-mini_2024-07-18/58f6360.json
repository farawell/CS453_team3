According to the description, the chatbot must return only the part of speech tag, which is what it has done. It is not possible to determine from the output alone whether this tag is correct, as the correctness would require knowledge of the input sentence and word. However, compliance in terms of returning a tag as described has been met. There are no elements that contradict the described task.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
