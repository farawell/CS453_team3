Since the description specifies that the output should only be the part of speech tag, the chatbot's response seems to comply with this guideline. There is no additional text or deviation from the format of the expected tag. Given that I am not to consider functionality or correctness due to the absence of the input sentence, the output \"FW\" adheres to the description by being a single, valid part-of-speech tag as required.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
