  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is \"CantAnswer,\" which is listed in the description as an acceptable response if the chatbot is unable to tag the word. Since the description provides specific scenarios in which \"CantAnswer\" can be used, and the output given matches one of the listed potential outputs (i.e., either the part-of-speech tag, \"Unknown\", or \"CantAnswer\"), this aligns with the described functionality. As the rules that require input are ignored, there is no violation.\n\nOK"
