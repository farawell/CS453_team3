  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides the part of speech tag \"WB\" for a given word. Upon reviewing the provided list of part-of-speech tags, it becomes evident that \"WB\" is not among the listed tags. According to the description, if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, the chatbot should return \"Unknown\". Alternatively, if the word cannot be tagged, the response should be \"CantAnswer\". Since \"WB\" is neither a recognized tag from the list nor one of the prescribed alternative responses, there is a clear violation of the chatbot description.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\nThe provided tag \"WB\" is not part of the listed tags.\nThe output does not use \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" as per the guidelines.\n\nERR"
