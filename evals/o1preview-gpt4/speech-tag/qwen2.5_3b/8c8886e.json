According to the description, it should return only the part of speech tag or \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if it can't tag the word or the word doesn't fit the listed tags. Without needing to know the input, I can verify that \"WP\" is indeed a tag mentioned in the description (\"WP: Wh-pronoun\").\n\nSince the output \"WP\" fits with one of the listed POS tags, I find no issue with compliance based on the output given.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
