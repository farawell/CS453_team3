Since \"NN\" is in the list of tags given (Noun, singular or mass), the output consists of only the part-of-speech tag, which complies with the requirement. There are no additional words or explanations in the output, which further ensures compliance. Therefore, the output adheres to the requirement of returning only the part-of-speech tag. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
