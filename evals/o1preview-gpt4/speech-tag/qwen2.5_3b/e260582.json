According to the description, the task is to determine the part of speech for a given word and return just the tag for the word's part of speech. The output complies with the format requirements, as it is a single part-of-speech tag and is included in the provided list. Since I cannot determine if \"WP\" is the correct tag for the input without additional context, I only check for compliance with the description's format requirements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
