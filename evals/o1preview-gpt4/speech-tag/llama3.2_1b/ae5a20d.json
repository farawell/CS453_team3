  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output provides information about multiple tags, giving descriptions and examples of usage, which is more than just providing \"the tag for the word's part of speech\" as described in the task. Moreover, the chatbot describes context (\"in conjunction with 'She said'\" and \"'and'\") which is not required. The instruction is clear - return only the tag. The explanation about the word 'adi贸s' being a proper noun goes beyond just providing the POS tag. Therefore, the output does not comply with the description.\n\nThere are two main issues: \n1. Instead of providing a single tag, the output provides and explains multiple tags.\n2. It gives extra descriptions and examples instead of only giving the part of speech tag.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
