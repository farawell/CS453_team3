  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot contains multiple elements that show non-compliance with the described task:\n\n1. **Format**: The task specifies that only the part of speech tag should be returned, whereas the output contains more than the part of speech tags, including words, explanations, and notes.\n\n2. **Incorrect Tagging**: The tag \"INF\" is used which is not listed in the provided list of part-of-speech tags. Additionally, IN is described as \"Preposition or subordinating conjunction,\" not as a tag related to infinitives (which is actually not on the list), further indicating a wrong usage of tags.\n\n3. **Excess Information**: The note provided about \"INF\" being potentially better is irrelevant to the task, which requires only providing the tag, leading to unnecessary information being presented.\n\nConsidering these points, the chatbot outputs more information than required, uses an incorrect format, and employs a tag that is not in the provided list, indicating non-compliance. \n\nERR"
