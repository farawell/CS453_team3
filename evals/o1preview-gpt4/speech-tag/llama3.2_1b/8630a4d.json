  "complianceText": "The chatbot output lists two responses: \"Word: CC (Coordinating conjunction)\" and \"CantAnswer (No tags can be applied).\" According to the description, the chatbot should return only a single part of speech tag if possible, and if no tags can be applied, the output should be \"CantAnswer.\"\n\nIn this output, there is an attempt to tag with \"CC,\" which is a valid part of speech tag listed in the description, but it also includes \"CantAnswer,\" which contradicts the application of a tag. The description specifies returning only one tag or \"CantAnswer\" if no tagging can be done, not both.\n\nThus, the inclusion of two responses makes this output non-compliant with the description's instruction to return only one option. The output gives two contradictory responses: one indicating a tag and another saying no tags can be applied, which logically conflicts within the scope of the task.\n\nERR"
