  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot does not comply with the description for several reasons:\n\n1. **Invalid Part-of-speech Tags**: The chatbot provides part-of-speech tags like \"PTV\" and \"VVN,\" which are not part of the specified list of tags in the chatbot description. The description provides a specific set of tags that should be used, and any deviation from that list is non-compliant.\n\n2. **Additional Information**: The output contains additional explanations like \"VV (Verb is the 1st person singular present tense of walk),\" which is not allowed. The description specifies that only the part of speech tag should be returned, with no supplementary information.\n\n3. **Incorrect Handling of the 'Can't Answer' Response**: The output \"CC: Can't answer.\" suggests an association with the \"CC\" part-of-speech tag, which stands for \"Coordinating conjunction,\" rather than using the required response format \"CantAnswer\" as specified in the description. \n\nThe evaluation leads to the conclusion that the output does not adhere to the description because it presents unlisted tags, provides unauthorized explanations, and misuses the \"Can't Answer\" response.\n\nERR"
