  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output lists a part of speech tag \"CC: Correlative conjunction\" and another \"CT0: Article, third person singular present (uncountable)\". The description provides specific part of speech tags, and \"CC\" is listed as \"Coordinating conjunction,\" not \"Correlative conjunction.\" Furthermore, \"CT0\" is not a tag listed in the description at all, which violates the compliance requirement to only use tags from the given list. The description explicitly states that if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, \"Unknown\" should be returned or \"CantAnswer\" if unable to tag it. These errors suggest non-compliance based on the output given.\n\nThe outputs \"SYM: Symbol\" and \"UH: Interjection\" match tags from the list provided in the description, but the presence of invalid tags in the output overrides these compliant parts, leading to an overall non-compliance.\n\nERR"
