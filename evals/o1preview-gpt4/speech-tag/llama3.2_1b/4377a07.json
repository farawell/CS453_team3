However, the output includes \"Cardinal number\" alongside the tag \"DT\". Furthermore, \"DT\" is the tag for a Determiner, not a Cardinal number, indicating another potential issue. The correct format should be just the tag itself, with no explanation or additional information. This output does not conform to the specification of giving only the part of speech tag without embellishment.\n\nERR"
