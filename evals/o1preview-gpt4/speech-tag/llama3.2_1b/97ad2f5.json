However, upon inspection, none of the tags provided in the output ('P'', 'PS'', '?') match any in the described list of part-of-speech tags. According to the guidelines, if a word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, the chatbot should return \"Unknown,\" and if unable to tag the word, it should return \"CantAnswer.\" The output does not adhere to this requirement. Additionally, only one tag should be returned for the word's part of speech, but the output provides multiple incorrect tags without following these rules.\n\nERR"
