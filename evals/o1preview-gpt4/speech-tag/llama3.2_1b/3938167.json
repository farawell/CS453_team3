According to the task description, the output should return only the part-of-speech tag for the given word, without any additional labeling or formatting. The expected format for a correct response is a single tag matching the tags listed in the description (e.g., CC, JJS, NN, etc.). \n\nIn this output, the format \"CC: CC\" and \"JJS: JJS\" includes additional labeling or formatting by repeating the part of speech tag, which is not compliant with the task description that specifies returning only the tag itself. Therefore, the output does not match the required format.\n\nERR"
