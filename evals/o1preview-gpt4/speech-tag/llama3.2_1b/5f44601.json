However, the presence of \"CantAnswer\" alongside \"IN\" is problematic because the description requires the chatbot to return only one tag. The inclusion of both \"IN\" and \"CantAnswer\" is a violation of the rule to return only one tag. The presence of two separate outputs indicates non-compliance with the guideline of providing a single, specific response for the word's part of speech.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
