The output does include a tag 'NN', which is from the list. However, it adds additional text '(Noun)', which is not instructed by the description. According to the description, only the part-of-speech tag should be returned. There is evidence of non-compliance because the output provides additional information beyond the tag itself.\n\nMention the reason for violation and the thinking that went into coming up with it.\nERR"
