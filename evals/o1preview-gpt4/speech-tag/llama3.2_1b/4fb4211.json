However, according to the description, the output should only be one single part-of-speech tag without any explanations or multiple tags. Additionally, if the word cannot be tagged or if the chatbot is unable to tag the word, the outputs should be 'Unknown' or 'CantAnswer', respectively, not a list of tags. \nThe presence of multiple tags and explanations in the output does not comply with the requirement of returning just a single part-of-speech tag or a specific response like 'Unknown' or 'CantAnswer'. \n\nViolation occurs as the output is not a single tag nor one of the specified responses for untaggable words.\n\nERR"
