  "complianceText": "The task requires the chatbot to return only the part of speech tag for a given word. However, the output provided by the chatbot includes not only the part of speech tags (within parentheses) but also the words themselves and other extraneous characters (such as asterisks and spaces). According to the description, the chatbot should only provide the tag for the word's part of speech, without additional characters, the word itself, or any formatting marks. Therefore, the output does not comply with the requirement of returning \"just the tag for the word's part of speech.\" \n\nAdditionally, the description does not specify any ordering or multiple word handling in this format, and so without knowing the input, only the formatting can be evaluated.\n\nERR"
