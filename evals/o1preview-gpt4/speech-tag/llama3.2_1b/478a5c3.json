The description clearly states to return \"only the part of speech tag,\" and in cases where the word's part of speech cannot be determined, to return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer.\" Here, the output provides \"IN\" twice with \"CANTAnswer\" also included, creating multiple outputs instead of a single, specific tag. This redundancy does not comply with the requirement of returning only a singular part of speech tag or \"Unknown\"/\"CantAnswer.\"\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
