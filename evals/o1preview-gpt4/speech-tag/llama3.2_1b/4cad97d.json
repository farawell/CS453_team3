  "complianceText": "The chatbot description states that only specific part-of-speech tags should be returned. The list provided in the description does not include \"JD\" as a valid part-of-speech tag. The first output \"CC (Coordinating conjunction)\" is compliant as \"CC\" is a valid tag. However, including an invalid tag \"JD\" violates the guidelines. The description also mandates that only one part-of-speech tag should be returned, whereas here, two tags are returned. The second tag should have been \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" since \"JD\" is not in the provided list.\n\nAs a result, this violates the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
