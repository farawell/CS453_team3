  "complianceText": "The chatbot output lists parts of speech tags for words, but the evaluation must focus on compliance with the description. The output contains the tag \"ZZ: Unknown\", which is not in the provided list of tags. The instruction states that if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, the tag should be either \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\". The tag \"ZZ: Unknown\" does not comply with the specific instructions for tagging. Additionally, the output provides additional commentary and guidance (e.g., \"Since words are identical, we should consider 'is' as a single unit\") which is not part of the required output according to the description that specifies the return should ONLY be the part of speech tag.\n\nThus, there is non-compliance with the description due to using an incorrect tag format and providing additional unnecessary information.\n\nERR"
