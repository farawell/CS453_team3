Instead, it provides a list of items.\n2. The part of speech tag is only given for one word (\"Before\"), but the output lists additional words without providing corresponding tags.\n3. There are symbols like asterisks and multiple entries that detract from providing a single part of speech tag or a single word lacking a tag being marked as \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer.\"\n\nBased on these points, the evaluation indicates a violation of direct compliance with the description provided.\n\nERR"
