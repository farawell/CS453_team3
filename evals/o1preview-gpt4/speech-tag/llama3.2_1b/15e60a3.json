However, in this case, the chatbot output includes additional information (\"Here are the part of speech tags for each word:\" and \"- Both: \"), which is not in compliance with the requirement to return only the part of speech tag. Additionally, although the output does include a single part of speech tag, \"CC\", it is prefixed by the word \"Both:\", which is unnecessary as per the task description. Therefore, the output does not comply with the description.\n\nERR"
