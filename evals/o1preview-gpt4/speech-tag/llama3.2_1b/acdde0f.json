  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides multiple tags for the word \"go\": VB, VBG, and VBP. According to the description, the chatbot should return a single part-of-speech tag for the given word. There is no mention in the description which permits to return multiple tags for the word's part of speech. Therefore, this output does not comply with the instruction to return just the tag for the word's part of speech, as it provides more than one tag. This constitutes a violation. Here is the reasoning:\n\n1. The description specifies that only the tag for the word's part of speech should be returned, without indication of listing multiple possibilities.\n2. The chatbot output provides three part-of-speech tags, which does not align with the instruction to return a single tag.\n\nTherefore, multiple tags provided in this output constitute non-compliance.\n\nERR"
