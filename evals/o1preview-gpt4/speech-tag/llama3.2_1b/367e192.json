  "complianceText": "The output contains two parts: \"CC: Coordinating conjunction\" and \"Unknown: CantAnswer\".\n\n1. The first part, \"CC: Coordinating conjunction\", seems to indicate a part of speech tag (\"CC\") followed by its description (\"Coordinating conjunction\"). However, the chatbot description specifies that only the part of speech tag should be returned, not its description.\n\n2. The second part, \"Unknown: CantAnswer\", does not comply with the description. If the bot cannot determine the part of speech, it should either return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\", but not both or in this format.\n\nGiven these points, the output violates the requirement to return only the tag or one of the terms “Unknown” or “CantAnswer”.\n\nERR"
