According to the description, the chatbot should return only one part of speech tag or \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if applicable. The output lists multiple possibilities against the rules which require a single tag or status to be returned. Additionally, \"PWT\" is not part of the listed tags in the description, which means it is not compliant with the tag list provided. The presence of multiple tags and an unlisted tag clearly violates the guidelines.\n\nERR"
