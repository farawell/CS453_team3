  "complianceText": "The output specifies the word \"reading\" and assigns it the tag \"IN,\" which stands for Preposition or subordinating conjunction. According to the guidelines, the tag should correspond accurately to the word's part of speech. However, without the sentence that \"reading\" was a part of, it is impossible to know the correctness of this tag. Hence, correctness of the tag cannot be evaluated here and should be ignored. Nonetheless, the rule states to return only the part of speech tag. Here, the output includes an additional part (\"Word: reading\"), which is not in accordance with the requirement to return just the part of speech tag. Therefore, the output doesn't adhere to the format specified in the description. \n\nERR"
