  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description. It presents three part-of-speech tags: 'PP: Predeterminer,' 'VB: Verb,' and 'BLF: Blorf.' The first two tags, 'PP' and 'VB,' are not returning just a single tag as the task requires, and 'PP' is not a listed part-of-speech tag in the given description. Furthermore, 'BLF: Blorf' includes an explanation and is not a standard tag or 'Unknown' or 'CantAnswer' as described. The task description requires only the part-of-speech tag to be returned without additional information, and 'BLF' is also not a valid part-of-speech tag according to the provided list. Therefore, the output violates the core requirements of returning a singular tag that corresponds with the provided list or 'Unknown'/'CantAnswer.'\n\nERR"
