According to the description, the chatbot should only return the part of speech tag or the words \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer.\" While \"CantAnswer\" is a valid output based on the description, it should only be given once for each input. The redundancy of repeating \"CantAnswer\" does not comply with the instruction to return \"just the tag.\" \n\nBased on this reasoning, my decision is as follows:\nERR"
