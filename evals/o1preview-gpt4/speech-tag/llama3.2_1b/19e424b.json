  "complianceText": "The chatbot description specifies that the output should either be a part-of-speech tag, \"Unknown,\" or \"CantAnswer.\" In the given output, several issues are present:\n\n1. The description states that the output should be a tag or specific terms (\"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\") and nothing else. However, the output contains the additional text: \"Sentence: CANTANSWER (The word \"to\" cannot be tagged with a part of speech)\" and other lines that don't conform with the expected format, such as \"Sentence: WANT,\" \"Word: to,\" etc.\n\n2. The Chatbot's output does include \"CantAnswer,\" which is a correct tag, but because the additional text does not comply with the described output format (returning only the tag or designated terms), it violates the direct compliance requirements set forth in the description. \n\nTherefore, the presence of additional text in the output that doesn't conform to the format prescribed by the description leads me to conclude that there is a violation.\n\nERR"
