However, it should just return the tag itself without any additional information or annotations. In this case, the output provides additional information \"(Conjunction)\" with the tag \"CC,\" which does not comply with the instruction to return just the tag. Therefore, the output does not strictly adhere to the description.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
