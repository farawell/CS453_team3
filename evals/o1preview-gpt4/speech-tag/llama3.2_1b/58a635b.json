  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is evaluating a sentence to determine the part of speech for a given word and should return just the tag for the word's part of speech as per the description. The output provided includes extra information: \"NN (noun)\" is repeated twice and there is also \"She\" included in the output. According to the description, the output should be just the part of speech tag. Any text beyond the single part of speech tag itself is non-compliant with the requirement to return \"only the part of speech tag.\" Therefore, the presence of additional words and repeated tags in the output means the chatbot's output is not compliant.\n\nThe description also states that if the word cannot be tagged with a listed tag or if the chatbot is unable to tag it, it should return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer.\" This check requires input context which is not available in this violation process and thus is ignored in the context of this evaluation.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
