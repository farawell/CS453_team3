The description specifies that the chatbot must return only the part of speech tag, and if applicable, use just one tag per word. Any additional information or formatting is not allowed according to the description. The output \"IN  - Determiner\" includes an extra element with the description \"Determiner,\" alongside just the tag \"IN.\" Additionally, the format is incorrect as it contains both tags and descriptions, which is not in compliance. The presence of \"NP : Noun\" provides extra information beyond just the part of speech tags. These considerations indicate that the chatbot has not followed the directive to return only the tags. Therefore, there is a violation.\n\nThe chatbot output violates the requirement by providing extra descriptors and incorrect format: \"IN  - Determiner\" and \"NP : Noun,\" which contain more than just the tags themselves.\n\nERR"
