|-|-|-|-|-|
|1\. sentence: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\. word: fox|ok|The input consists of two parts: a sentence and a word\. Here, the sentence is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\." and the word is "fox"\. <br><br>Let's evaluate the input based on each rule provided in the specification:<br><br>1\. \*\*Sentence as a Grammatically Correct Sentence\*\*: The sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\." is a well\-known example of a grammatically correct sentence\. It has a subject \("The quick brown fox"\) and a predicate \("jumps over the lazy dog"\), and it ends with a period\.<br><br>2\. \*\*Word Containment in Sentence\*\*: The word "fox" is indeed contained within the sentence\.<br><br>3\. \*\*Sentence Longer than Word\*\*: The sentence is several words longer than the single word "fox", thus fulfilling the requirement\.<br><br>4\. \*\*Punctuation\*\*: The sentence contains a period, which is allowed, and the word "fox" has no punctuation marks\.<br><br>5\. \*\*Delimiter\*\*: The specification mentions a specific delimiter like whitespace or special character to separate the sentence and the word\. The input format shows the sentence and the word are separated by âsentence:â and âword:â, both followed by a space, which is a recognized delimiter here\.<br><br>6\. \*\*Input String Length\*\*: The entire input string appears to be well within the 500 character limit\.<br><br>After considering all specifications, the input meets all requirements as per the provided specification\. There is no rule violation\.<br><br>OK|1|NN|
|2\. sentence: She sells sea shells by the sea shore\. word: by|ok|To evaluate the given input, let's break down the components of the input specification one by one:<br><br>1\. \*\*Sentence Component\*\*: "She sells sea shells by the sea shore\."<br>   \- It appears to be a grammatically correct sentence\. It begins with a capital letter and ends with a period, fitting the conventional structure of a sentence\.<br>   \- The sentence contains eight words: "She", "sells", "sea", "shells", "by", "the", "sea", "shore"\.<br><br>2\. \*\*Word Component\*\*: "by"<br>   \- The word "by" is a single word contained within the sentence\. It matches one of the words in the sentence component\.<br><br>3\. \*\*Sentence Length Requirement\*\*: The sentence must be at least one word longer than the word component\.<br>   \- The sentence has 8 words\. This means if the sentence did not contain the word "by", it would have 7 words\. Hence, its length is indeed more than one word longer than the word component\.<br><br>4\. \*\*Punctuation\*\*: The sentence may contain punctuation marks, and the word component must not have punctuation marks\.<br>   \- The sentence appropriately uses a period at the end, and the word "by" contains no punctuation, complying with these rules\.<br><br>5\. \*\*Delimiter Requirement\*\*: The sentence and the word component must be separated by a specific delimiter\.<br>   \- In the provided input, the delimiter used is ": " \(the colon followed by a space\) before "sentence" and "word" components\. While the specification did not explicitly mention this delimiter, it implies that an acceptable delimiter \(such as the colon\-space combination here\) should separate the sentence and word\.<br><br>6\. \*\*Character Limit\*\*: The entire input string, including the delimiter, must not exceed 500 characters\.<br>   \- The provided input appears to be far below this character limit\.<br><br>Based on the analysis, the input adheres to all points of the input specification\. There are no indications or evidence suggesting otherwise\.<br><br>OK|1|IN|
|5\. sentence: If wishes were horses, beggars would ride\. word: wishes|ok|The input is structured in a manner that separates the sentence and word components with the delimiter "sentence: " and " word: "\. <br><br>First, I will analyze the sentence component: "If wishes were horses, beggars would ride\."  <br>\- This sentence seems grammatically correct\. <br>\- It contains words and appropriate punctuation \(a period at the end\)\.<br><br>Next, I will analyze the word component: "wishes"<br>\- This is a single word with no punctuation\.<br><br>Checking if the word is contained in the sentence:<br>\- The word "wishes" is indeed present in the sentence\.<br><br>Checking if the sentence is at least one word longer than the word component:<br>\- The sentence has seven words \("If", "wishes", "were", "horses", "beggars", "would", "ride"\), whereas the word component is one word\. Thus, the sentence is six words longer than the word component, fulfilling the requirement\.<br><br>I will also check if the entire input string exceeds 500 characters:<br>\- The given input string is much less than 500 characters\.<br><br>Based on this analysis, the input adheres to all specified conditions, and there are no violations\.<br><br>OK|1|NNS|
|6\. sentence: I will arrive at the station by two o'clock\. word: by|ok|Upon evaluating the input based on the specifications:<br><br>1\. The input consists of two components: a sentence and a word\.<br>2\. The sentence is "I will arrive at the station by two o'clock\." which is grammatically correct\.<br>3\. The word component is "by"\.<br>4\. The sentence contains the word "by"\.<br>5\. The sentence is longer than just the word "by" as it contains multiple other words\.<br>6\. Punctuation is present in the sentence but not in the word component\.<br>7\. However, the components are separated by the delimiter "6\. sentence:" and "word:", which includes colons and full stop after the '6', thus itâs not the typical whitespace or special character delimiter one might expect\.<br>8\. The specification mentions the use of a specific delimiter, but it does not explicitly restrict the format of this delimiter, so based on the given information, I must interpret that "6\. sentence:" and "word:" form the delimiter and the components are correctly separated by it\.<br><br>Considering these points and given the lack of specific restrictions on the composition of the delimiter apart from it being present, the input adheres to the specification provided\.<br><br>OK|1|IN|
|7\. sentence: Either the dog or the cat is in the garden\. word: Either|ok|First, I will evaluate the input to make sure it meets the input specification\.<br><br>1\. The sentence provided is "Either the dog or the cat is in the garden\." It appears to be grammatically correct\.<br>2\. The word provided is "Either"\.<br>3\. The word "Either" is present in the sentence, indicating compliance with the condition that the word component must be contained in the sentence\.<br>4\. I also note that the sentence is "Either the dog or the cat is in the garden\.", which has 9 words, excluding punctuation, whereas the word component is one word\. This satisfies the condition that the sentence must be at least one word longer than the word component\.<br>5\. The sentence and word components are separated by a specific delimiter \(": " and a space\)\.<br>6\. The length of the entire input string, including the delimiter, is within the 500\-character limit\.<br><br>Based on my evaluation, the input meets all the input specifications\.<br><br>OK|1|CC|
|8\. sentence: There are many approaches to solve this problem\. word: are|ok|\*\*Evaluation and Reasoning:\*\*<br><br>1\. \*\*Delimiter Check\*\*: The input uses a '\.' \(period\) after the 'sentence' and 'word' labels as delimiters\. This complies with the requirement of using a delimiter between the sentence and word components\.<br><br>2\. \*\*Sentence Requirement\*\*: The sentence provided is "There are many approaches to solve this problem\." It is a complete sentence, correctly structured, and contains proper punctuation marks\. This satisfies the specification of being a grammatically correct sentence\.<br><br>3\. \*\*Word Requirement\*\*: The word component is "are," which is a single word as required\. <br><br>4\. \*\*Word in Sentence\*\*: The word "are" is indeed contained in the sentence "There are many approaches to solve this problem\."<br><br>5\. \*\*Word Component Longer Requirement\*\*: The sentence consists of 8 words: "There," "are," "many," "approaches," "to," "solve," "this," "problem\." The word component "are" is just 1 word\. The sentence must be at least one word longer than the word, which it is, as there are a total of 8 words in the sentence\. 8 words minus 1 word is 7, which confirms the sentence is longer by at least 1 word\.<br><br>6\. \*\*Character Limit\*\*: The entire input, including delimiters and spaces, is 66 characters long, which is within the 500\-character limit\.<br><br>Given these observations, the input meets all the conditions specified in the input specification\.<br><br>OK|1|VB|
|10\. sentence: Between the pages of the book, there was a letter\. word: Between|ok|To evaluate the given input based on the provided specification, let's break it down as follows:<br><br>1\. \*\*Sentence and Word Components\*\*: <br>   \- The sentence component is "Between the pages of the book, there was a letter\."<br>   \- The word component is "Between\."<br><br>2\. \*\*Grammatical Check of Sentence\*\*: <br>   \- The sentence "Between the pages of the book, there was a letter\." is a grammatically correct sentence as it contains a subject and a verb, and it completes a thought\.<br><br>3\. \*\*Presence and Correctness of Word Component\*\*: <br>   \- The word "Between" is indeed present in the sentence\.<br><br>4\. \*\*Sentence Longer than Word Component\*\*:<br>   \- The sentence must be at least one word longer than the word component\. The sentence consists of 10 words, while the word component consists of 1 word \("Between"\)\. Therefore, the sentence is longer than the word component\.<br><br>5\. \*\*Punctuation in Word Component\*\*:<br>   \- The word component "Between" does not contain any punctuation, complying with the specification\.<br><br>6\. \*\*Delimiter\*\*:<br>   \- The input uses "sentence:" and "word:" as delimiters to separate components, which is a specific delimiter use as described by the prompt\.<br><br>7\. \*\*Character Limit\*\*:<br>   \- The entire input string, including delimiters: "10\. sentence: Between the pages of the book, there was a letter\. word: Between" consists of 71 characters, which does not exceed the 500 character limit specified\.<br><br>Given these observations, the entire input complies with every part of the input specification, and no violations were found\.<br><br>OK|1|IN|
|11\. sentence: The cake was sweet and delightful\. word: and|ok|Upon evaluating the given input against the provided specification, it seems to be checking two components: a sentence and a word from that sentence\.<br><br>1\. \*\*Sentence Component\*\*: "The cake was sweet and delightful\." is a grammatically correct sentence with proper punctuation, satisfying the sentence component requirement\.<br><br>2\. \*\*Word Component\*\*: The word component provided is "and"\. This word is indeed part of the sentence as it appears exactly within it\.<br><br>3\. \*\*Word Exclusion of Punctuation\*\*: The word component does not contain punctuation, aligning with the specification\.<br><br>4\. \*\*Sentence Length Requirement\*\*: The specification requires that the sentence must be at least one word longer than the word component\. Here, the sentence has 6 words: "The", "cake", "was", "sweet", "and", "delightful\."\. Excluding the word component "and", there are 5 remaining words, hence this condition is met\.<br><br>5\. \*\*Delimiter and Total Length\*\*: The sentence and word appear to be separated by specified key "sentence:" and "word:", using colons appropriately as delimiters\. This meets the specification's requirement regarding separation potentially via a special character, though specification doesn't explicitly provide a specific delimiter\. The total length of the input is well below 500 characters\.<br><br>Based on the evaluation, all components of the input comply with the given input specifications\.<br><br>OK|1|CC|
|12\. sentence: Every dog has its day\. word: its|ok|The input has two components: the sentence and the word\. The sentence provided is "Every dog has its day" and the word provided is "its"\.

The components are separated by a colon and whitespace, which serves as the delimiter\.<br><br>According to the input specification, the sentence must be grammatically correct\. The sentence "He plays the piano beautifully\." is grammatically correct\. The word component must be a single word contained within the sentence, and "beautifully" is indeed a word within the sentence\.

|21\. sentence: On the shelf, a lone book caught my attention\. word: lone|ok|The input appears to be divided by a colon \(:\) after the word "sentence" and "word"\. The sentence provided is "On the shelf, a lone book caught my attention\." and the word provided is "lone"\. Firstly, the sentence "On the shelf, a lone book caught my attention\." is grammatically correct\. Secondly, the word component "lone" is indeed a word contained in the sentence\.<br><br>Now, regarding the length of the sentence, it contains 8 words: "On", "the", "shelf", "a", "lone", "book", "caught", and "my attention\." The word component "lone" is a single word, and the condition states that the sentence must be at least one word longer than the word component\. Since 8 words are certainly longer than the single word component "lone", that condition is met\.<br><br>Next, I checked that no punctuation marks are present in the word component "lone", which satisfies that requirement of the specification\. In terms of delimiter, the input uses a colon followed by a whitespace between 'sentence' and the sentence, as well as between 'word' and the word\.

Punctuation marks are allowed in the sentence but not in the word component\.<br>   \- Punctuation marks are present in the sentence "Please submit the report by Friday\.", and none are included in the word "submit"\.<br><br>5\. The word and sentence components must be separated by a specific delimiter such as whitespace or special character\.<br>   \- It appears that the separator here is a colon followed by a space ": "\. Each component is properly prefixed with a descriptor \("sentence:" and "word:"\) followed by appropriate content\.<br><br>6\. The entire input string, including the delimiter, must not exceed 500 characters\.<br>   \- The input string "22\. sentence: Please submit the report by Friday\. word: submit" is well below the 500 character limit\.<br><br>All parts of the input comply with the detailed specification\.
