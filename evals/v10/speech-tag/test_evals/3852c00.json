It is indeed a grammatically correct sentence with a subject \"there\" and a predicate \"was light,\" along with an introductory phrase \"Despite the darkness.\"\n\nNext, examine the word component \"there.\" It is present in the sentence as required.\n\nNow, check if the sentence is at least one word longer than the word component. The sentence contains six words, while the word component contains one word. Therefore, the sentence is more than one word longer than the word component.\n\nAdditionally, there is no punctuation in the word component, satisfying that requirement.\n\nRegarding the delimiter, since the input did not specify a fixed delimiter such as a whitespace or special character, it is assumed as valid, as the input clearly distinguishes both components.\n\nFinally, verify if the entire input string, including the delimiter space, exceeds 500 characters. The input string given is significantly less than 500 characters.\n\nSince all conditions are met, the input complies with the input specification.\n\nOK",

There is no way to determine if \"EX\" is the correct tag without knowing the input. Therefore, solely based on compliance with the format specified in the description, there is no violation present in this output.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
