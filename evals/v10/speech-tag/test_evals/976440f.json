  "validityText": "The input is structured with a sentence and a word. The sentence component is \"I watched it version by version.\" which is grammatically correct. The word component is \"version,\" which is a single word present in the sentence. \n\nThe sentence is at least one word longer than the word component. The sentence has six words, and since the word component \"version\" appears once, the sentence has five other words which satisfies the requirement that the sentence is at least one word longer than the word component. \n\nPunctuation marks are present in the sentence but not in the word component, which is allowed according to the specification. \n\nHowever, while the word and sentence components should be separated by a specific delimiter, the input doesn't specify any delimiter between the sentence and the word component. It seems to use a space, which could be considered a delimiter, but this isn't explicitly mentioned. The specification asks for 'a specific delimiter,' which implies more explicit separation. Thus the input could be vague on this point, but given context and common usage, space often acts as a delimiter; this might allow some leniency depending on interpretation. \n\nNonetheless, if interpreting the space as a valid delimiter, the input meets all criteria and does not exceed 500 characters in total length.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The output \"NN\" is a part of speech tag listed in the description (Noun, singular or mass). The description requires that only the part of speech tag be returned, which the output correctly adheres to. Thus, based on the output being a valid part of speech tag and the instruction to return only the tag, there is compliance with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
