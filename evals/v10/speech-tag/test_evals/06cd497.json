Here, the word is \"freezing,\" and it is indeed present in the sentence.\n\n3. **Word Component and Sentence Length**: The sentence must be at least one word longer than the word component. The sentence contains 5 words (\"It\", \"is\", \"absolutely\", \"freezing\", \"today\"), and the word component \"freezing\" is 1 word. Therefore, the sentence is 4 words longer than the word component, satisfying this requirement.\n\n4. **Punctuation**: The sentence contains punctuation (a period at the end), which is allowed. The word component \"freezing\" does not contain any punctuation, which complies with the specification.\n\n5. **Delimiter**: The sentence and the word component are separated by a space, adhering to the requirement for a delimiter.\n\n6. **Character Limit**: The input string in its entirety does not exceed 500 characters.\n\nSince all components of the input conform to the specification, the input is valid.\n\nOK",
