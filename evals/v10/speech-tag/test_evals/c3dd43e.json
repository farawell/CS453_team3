It is a single word without any punctuation.\n3. **Word Containment**: The word \"then\" appears in the sentence \"But then where?\".\n4. **Sentence Length**: The sentence \"But then where?\" must have at least one word more than the word component \"then\". The sentence is composed of three words (\"But\", \"then\", \"where\") compared to the single word component.\n5. **Delimiter**: The sentence and the word must be separated by a specific delimiter. In this case, a whitespace is used to separate the sentence and the word component, which complies with the specification.\n6. **Character Limit**: The entire input string has 18 characters, which is well within the 500-character limit specified.\n\nI have reviewed the input against each specification point and found the input to be compliant.
