  "rule": "If it is not possible to determine the part of speech of the word, the output must be the string \"CantAnswer\".",
  "input": "He activated the system. system",
  "validityText": "The input needs to be evaluated based on the given specification: \n\n1. **Sentence Correctness**: The sentence \"He activated the system.\" appears to be grammatically correct. It forms a complete sentence.\n2. **Word in Sentence**: The word \"system\" is indeed present in the sentence.\n3. **Sentence Longer than Word**: The sentence contains four words (\"He\", \"activated\", \"the\", \"system\"). The word component is only \"system\", which is one word. The sentence is three words longer than the word component, which satisfies the specification that the sentence must be at least one word longer than the word component.\n4. **Punctuation**: There is a period at the end of the sentence, which is allowed. The word component \"system\" has no punctuation, which complies with the specification.\n5. **Delimiter**: Based on \"system\" being separated from the other words by a space, it seems that a single whitespace acts as the delimiter since the input appears in two parts separated by space or whitespace. Without more context on the delimiter's specification and constraints, the default delimiter is assumed to be a space.\n6. **Character Limit**: The entire input string \"He activated the system. system\" consists of 33 characters, which is well within the 500-character limit.\n\nNo violation identified in the specifications issued. Each aspect of the input conforms to the specified rules. Therefore, the input string appears to comply with the specifications.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The output \"NN\" is a part-of-speech tag from the list provided in the chatbot description. The description instructs to return only the part of speech tag. The output complies with this instruction, as it is a single part-of-speech tag. \n\nThere is no indication that the output should contain anything more or less than the tag. Therefore, it adheres to the requirement of returning only the part of speech tag.\n\nOK",
