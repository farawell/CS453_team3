  "input": "Hello and goodbye, who said goodbye? who",
  "validityText": "The input consists of two components: a grammatically correct sentence and a word from that sentence, separated by a delimiter. Let's evaluate the given input based on the provided specification:\n\n1. **Sentence Component**: The input sentence is \"Hello and goodbye, who said goodbye?\".\n\n2. **Word Component**: The input word is \"who\".\n\n3. **Grammatical Correctness**: The sentence \"Hello and goodbye, who said goodbye?\" is complex but grammatically correct. It contains a comma and a question mark for punctuation. Punctuation is allowed in the sentence component.\n\n4. **Word Presence**: The word \"who\" is indeed present in the sentence.\n\n5. **Sentence Longer Than Word**: The specification requires that the sentence be at least one word longer than the word component. The sentence contains 6 words: \"Hello\", \"and\", \"goodbye\", \"who\", \"said\", \"goodbye?\".\n   - Without the punctuation treated as part of the sentence, \"goodbye?\" is considered a single word.\n   - The word component \"who\" is one word.\n   - The sentence has 5 words more than the word component, satisfying the requirement that it is at least one word longer.\n\n6. **Punctuation in Word Component**: There is no punctuation in the word component \"who\", complying with the specification.\n\n7. **Delimiter**: The input does not specify a distinct delimiter between the sentence and word components. The lack of clarity on the delimiter causes ambiguity regarding this rule's compliance. There is no whitespace or special character separating the sentence and word components. It seems the input might be returning the last word of the sentence as the word component, which is incorrect as it should explicitly be separated by a delimiter.\n\nGiven these considerations, there was no explicit delimiter between the sentence and word components, which violates the specification.\n\nERR",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output is \"WP\". According to the task description, the chatbot should provide a part-of-speech tag for a given word. The output \"WP\" corresponds to a Wh-pronoun, which is one of the tags listed explicitly in the task description. There is no indication that the output violates any specific rule. Therefore, as per the given guidelines, there is no violation of compliance with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
