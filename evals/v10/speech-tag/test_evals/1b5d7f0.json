  "input": "An apple, a day. apple",
  "validityText": "Upon evaluation of the given input \"An apple, a day. apple\", here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Sentence Component**: The input contains a sentence component, \"An apple, a day\". This appears to be a grammatically correct fragment but not a complete sentence due to the lack of a verb or completion of thought. Therefore, it does not comply with the rule that the sentence must be a grammatically correct sentence.\n\n2. **Word Component**: The word component is \"apple\", which is a single word from the sentence component. This complies with the rule that the word must be contained in the sentence without punctuation.\n\n3. **Length Constraint**: The sentence has four words (\"An\", \"apple,\", \"a\", \"day\") and the word component is \"apple\". The sentence is at least one word longer than the word component, complying with this rule.\n\n4. **Delimiter**: The input does contain a space between the sentence component and the word component, serving as a delimiter, which is allowed as a separator.\n\n5. **Character Limit**: The entire input, including the delimiter, is within the 500-character limit.\n\nThe primary issue is that the sentence component is not a complete and grammatically correct sentence. Therefore, there is a non-compliance with the input specification related to the grammatical structure of the sentence.\n\nERR",
