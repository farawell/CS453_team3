The input consists of a sentence \"She spoke swiftly yet softly.\" and a word \"swiftly\".\n\n1. The sentence must be grammatically correct. \"She spoke swiftly yet softly.\" is a grammatically correct sentence.\n\n2. The word must be a single word contained in the sentence. \"swiftly\" is a single word and is found in the sentence.\n\n3. The sentence must be at least one word longer than the word component. The sentence has 5 words: \"She\", \"spoke\", \"swiftly\", \"yet\", \"softly\". The word component has 1 word: \"swiftly\". 5 is greater than 1, fulfilling the condition that the sentence must have at least 2 words (one more than the word component).\n\n4. Punctuation marks are allowed in the sentence but not in the word component. The sentence has punctuation, however, the word component \"swiftly\" does not contain any punctuation marks.\n\n5. \"The word and sentence components must be separated by a specific delimiter, such as a whitespace or special character.\" This part of the specification is somewhat vague regarding what the specific delimiter should be. However, in this instance the space following the sentence and preceding the word \"swiftly\" could act as a delimiter.\n\n6. The entire input string must not exceed 500 characters. The input \"She spoke swiftly yet softly. swiftly\" is 36 characters long, which is within the limit.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the input satisfies all elements of the provided specification.\n\nOK",
