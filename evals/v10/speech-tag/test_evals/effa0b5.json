  "validityText": "The input consists of two components: a sentence and a word. The sentence provided is \"An incredible discovery of old times.\" which appears to be grammatically correct. The word component is \"discovery\", which is present in the sentence. The sentence is at least one word longer than the word component, as the sentence has 6 words and the word component has 1 word. The word does not contain punctuation, which adheres to the specification.\n\nHowever, there is an issue with the input concerning the specification of separating the sentence and the word components. The input does not demonstrate a clear delimiter between the sentence and the word component, such as a whitespace or special character. This absence of a specified delimiter means that the input does not comply with the specification requirement regarding the separation of components.\n\nERR",
