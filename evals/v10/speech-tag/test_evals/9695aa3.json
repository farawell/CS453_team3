It is present in the sentence, fulfilling the requirement that the word must be contained within the sentence.\n\n3. **Length Requirement**: The input specification requires that the sentence must be at least one word longer than the word component. In this case, the sentence contains five words (\"The best solutions are simple\") and the word component \"solutions\" is one of those words. The sentence is four words longer than the word component, which satisfies the requirement.\n\n4. **Delimiter and Length**: The word and sentence components are separated by a whitespace, which acts as a delimiter. The entire input string, including the delimiter, is within the 500-character limit.\n\nThere are no violations of the input specifications based on the points above.\n\nOK",
