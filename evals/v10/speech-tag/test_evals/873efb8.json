  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence \"The ancient tome lay unopened.\" and a word \"tome\". Here is my evaluation:\n\n1. The sentence is \"The ancient tome lay unopened.\" which is grammatically correct.\n2. The word provided is \"tome\", which is contained within the sentence.\n3. The sentence \"The ancient tome lay unopened.\" consists of four words, while the word component \"tome\" is a single word. This satisfies the requirement that the sentence must be at least one word longer than the word component.\n4. There is no punctuation in the word component itself.\n5. The input does not clearly show a specific delimiter separating the sentence from the word component. In the input given, there is only whitespace between the sentence and the word component. The input specification specifically demands a specific delimiter, but it is not overtly stated in the input string what this delimiter is intended to be.\n6. The entire input string is well under the 500 character limit.\n\nUpon reviewing the specification, it mentions that the components must be separated by a specific delimiter. The use of just a whitespace does not specify a unique delimiter, which appears to violate the specific delimiter requirement.\n\nERR",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output is \"NN\", which matches one of the part-of-speech tags listed in the description, specifically \"NN: Noun, singular or mass\". The description clearly states that the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag. The output complies with this requirement because it provides a valid tag from the provided list. The output is also strictly in line with the instruction to return just the tag, without any additional information or formatting errors.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
