According to the description, the output should only contain the tag for the word's part of speech. While the output does correctly conclude with the tag \"VB\", it includes additional information that exceeds the single tag requirement by explaining how \"whisper\" is being tagged. The output should have been limited to just the tag \"VB\". This is a violation as it does not comply with the requirement to return only the part of speech tag.\n\nERR"
