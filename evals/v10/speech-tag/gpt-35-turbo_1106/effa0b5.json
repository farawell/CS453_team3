  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is \"Noun\". According to the description provided, the output should be a specific part-of-speech tag from the listed options, such as NN, NNS, NNP, NNPS, etc. The output \"Noun\" is not one of the specified tags; it is a general category name. The description explicitly states to return only the part of speech tag. Since \"Noun\" is not in the list of permitted tags, it does not comply with the description. Therefore, my reasoning is that the output doesn't match the required format because it provides a category name instead of the specific tag. \n\nERR"
