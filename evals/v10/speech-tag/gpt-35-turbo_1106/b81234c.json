  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output provides a part of speech tag as \"VBD (Verb, past tense)\" for the word \"exclaimed.\" The description specifies that the output should return only the part of speech tag, without additional information or elaboration. This means the correct output should be just \"VBD\" and nothing else. The output includes additional description in parentheses, which goes beyond the requirement to return only the tag. Hence, it violates the requirement of returning only the tag without additional information.\n\nERR"
