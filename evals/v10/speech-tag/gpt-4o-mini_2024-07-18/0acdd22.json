There are no indications in the output of non-compliance, as it follows the instruction to provide the tag or to return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if applicable. Since no part of the evaluation process requires knowledge of the input here, we conclude that the output is compliant with the description.\n\nOK"
