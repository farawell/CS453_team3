The output must not include any additional text, explanations, or information beyond the specified category name.
The input text provided to the chatbot will always be a string representing a news article.
The chatbot must accurately determine the most appropriate category based on the content of the input text without relying on provided examples.

The category definitions must be strictly adhered to, ensuring consistency and clarity in classification across different inputs.

No assumptions or external information outside the input text should influence the chatbot’s classification decision.

The classification must be based on the content's primary focus, determining which category best represents the main topic of the input text.
The chatbot must maintain consistency in classification regardless of variations in input text length, style, or complexity.
The chatbot's response should allow for easy validation by checking if the output matches one of the four specified categories based on the input text's content.
