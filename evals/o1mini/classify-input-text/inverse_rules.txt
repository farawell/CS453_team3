The chatbot must not classify any provided input text into one of four predefined categories: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech.
The category "World" should not include news articles related to international affairs, global events, diplomatic relations, or political developments.
The category "Sports" should not encompass news articles that pertain to athletic events, sports teams, individual athletes, competitions, or related sports activities.
The category "Business" should not cover news articles concerning commerce, economic markets, corporate activities, financial developments, or business-related issues.
The category "Sci/Tech" should not involve news articles related to scientific discoveries, technological advancements, space exploration, or technical innovations.
The chatbot's output may include text beyond the four category names: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech.
The output can include additional text, explanations, or information beyond the specified category name.
The input text provided to the chatbot may not always be a string representing a news article.
The chatbot may rely on provided examples to determine the appropriate category based on the content of the input text.
Each classification decision does not have to be mutually exclusive, allowing the input text to be assigned to multiple categories.
The category definitions can be loosely interpreted, allowing for flexibility and variation in classification across different inputs.
The output may include misspellings and does not need to match exactly one of the category names: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech.
Assumptions or external information outside the input text can influence the chatbotâ€™s classification decision.
The chatbot may consider factors beyond the content and context of the provided input text in performing the classification.
The chatbot does not need to clearly define every entity involved in the classification process within these rules.
The chatbot may include instructions, questions, or prompts in its output alongside the category name.
The classification can be based on secondary aspects of the content, allowing multiple categories to represent the input text's topics.
The chatbot may vary in classification consistency depending on variations in input text length, style, or complexity.
The chatbot's response does not need to allow for easy validation by matching the output to one of the four specified categories based on the input text's content.
Each rule does not need to comprehensively cover all aspects of the output requirements, allowing for potential inaccuracies in classification.
