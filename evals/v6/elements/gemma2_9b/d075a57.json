  "complianceText": "To evaluate the compliance of the chatbot output with the given description, we need to examine the format and structure of the output without making any assumptions about the input text.\n\n1. **Output Structure:** The output should follow the desired format as outlined: \n\n   ```\n   Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n   People names: -||-\n   Specific topics: -||-\n   General themes: -||-\n   ```\n\n2. **Content Structure and Labels:**\n   - The labels \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\" are correctly used.\n   - The format for \"Company names\" and \"People names\" is using \"-||-\" to indicate no entries, which matches the form described.\n   - The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections are correctly filled with comma-separated lists as expected.\n\n3. **Additional Explanation:** The extra explanation included in the chatbot output goes beyond the direct format specified in the description. However, the inclusion of an explanation doesn't inherently violate the compliance as long as the required format is adhered to, which it is here.\n\nGiven the above considerations, the chatbot output complies with the description regarding structure and format.\n\nOK"
