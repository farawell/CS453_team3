According to the desired format stated in the description, the output should list company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes in a format where each section is followed by a comma-separated list of items within angle brackets. In this output, the company names and people names sections are mentioned but left blank without the placeholders. Furthermore, there are no angle brackets used in the output for any of the categories which directly contradicts the formatting rules as per the description. This inconsistency in formatting leads to non-compliance.\n\nERR"
