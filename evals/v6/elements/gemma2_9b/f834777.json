  "complianceText": "The chatbot output presents its analysis in the desired format as specified in the description. It provides lists with headings corresponding to \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" However, the \"People names\" section contains just a dash and no list, even if there are no names, which might be following a specific style not mentioned in the description. There is no explicit guideline provided in the description about how to present empty categories, so this wide formatting could be permissible.\n\nOverall, the output structure follows the expected pattern, with each category clearly labeled and presented.\n\nOK"
