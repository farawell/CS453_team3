The \"People names\" section should follow the desired format and include a comma-separated list (or the placeholder \"-||-\"), which the output does correctly as \"-||-\". So, this section is compliant.\n\n2. The \"Specific topics\" field should contain a comma separated list, which the output does correctly. \n\n3. The \"General themes\" section should also be in a comma-separated format, which it is.\n\nSince the \"Company names\" section and \"People names\" section both meet the formatting guideline, so do all subsequent categories. No issues of format are present.\n\nHence, based on the formatting compliance, the output is compliant with the description. \n\nOK"
