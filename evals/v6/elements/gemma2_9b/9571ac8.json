However, this is consistent with the description as no company names were extracted. This adheres to the format as per reference.\n\n2. **People names**: The output correctly uses '-||-' to indicate no people names were extracted, which is in line with the description.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The chatbot offers a list with commas: \"Jailbreaking AI, Code Section Instructions, Safety Guidelines\". This format complies with the directive in the description, as it requires a comma-separated list if topics are present.\n\n4. **General themes**: The output uses a comma-separated list: \"AI Safety, Responsible AI Development, Model Adherence to Instructions\". This conforms with the guidance provided, as it requires a comma-separated list if themes are present.\n\nThe elements of the output align with the specified format.
