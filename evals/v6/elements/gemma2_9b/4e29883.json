  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output follows the desired format outlined in the description. It correctly labels sections for \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\", with comma-separated lists for the latter two, even though the lists for \"Company names\" and \"People names\" are empty. This format compliance suggests that the output aligns with the chatbot's description.\n\nHowever, the last sentence \"Let me know if you have any other text snippets you'd like me to analyze!\" is not part of the specified output format in the description. The description does not mention any interactive or additional commentary outside of the structured data extraction.\n\nThis additional sentence does not directly follow the specified format, leading to a compliance issue since the description strictly requires a fixed format without extra content.\n\nERR"
