Since the evaluation is not concerned with correctness due to lack of input, this is compliant.\n   - \"People names\" also follows the requested format with a placeholder \"-||-\".\n   - \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" are both populated with comma-separated lists, as required.\n   \nBased on these observations, the output is in compliance with the format and instructions outlined in the description. There are no other detectable violations present based solely on the output format and structure provided.\n\nOK"
