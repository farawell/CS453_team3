  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not completely comply with the description. The format specified in the description requires each category to be presented as a \"-||-\" if there is nothing to list in that category, which the output seems to adhere to correctly for \"Company names\" and \"People names\". However, the description requires the use of a \"comma_separated_list_of_\" entities for \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\", instead the output uses string lists separated by commas with spaces. \n\nAnother issue is the output does not follow the exact case-sensitivity specified in the format. The description specifies the format without any extra formatting like asterisks or capitalizations (e.g., \"Company names:\" not \"**Company names:**\"). The output deviates from this by adding unwanted formatting which goes against the explicit requirement.\n\nTherefore, the output does not fully adhere to the description due to formatting inconsistencies.\n\nERR"
