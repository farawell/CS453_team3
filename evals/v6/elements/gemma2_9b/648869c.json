The \"Company names:\" and \"People names:\" sections are completely empty. Although it's possible that the actual text does not contain any company or people names, the format should still include a placeholder (e.g., \"Company names: None\") to comply with the description format. \n\n2. The inclusion of the sentence \"Let me know if you'd like to analyze a different text! ðŸ˜Š\" does not comply with the desired output format.
