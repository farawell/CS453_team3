This ties into the importance of robust prompt engineering practices to guide AI responses safely and responsibly. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other text you'd like me to analyze!",

The description requires the information to be extracted and formatted as follows:\n\nCompany names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>  \nPeople names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>  \nSpecific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>  \nGeneral themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n\nIn the chatbot's output, the separator \"-||-\" is correctly used for \"People names,\" indicating that there are no entries. However, for \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes,\" a comma-separated list is expected, but the provided list is not separated by commas. \n\nAnother issue is the inclusion of explanatory paragraphs after the extracted lists. The description does not mention any additional text or rationale beyond the required format. As a result, this additional text is non-compliant with the format.\n\nNo violation if the additional text is perceived to be clarification. \nERR"
