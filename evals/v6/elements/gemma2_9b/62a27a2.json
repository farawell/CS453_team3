  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not completely comply with the format specified in the description. The description mandates the use of comma-separated lists for each category, which the chatbot's output adheres to for company names, people names, and specific topics. However, the example text does not clearly specify if the general themes should also be presented as a comma-separated list. Despite this ambiguity, the general themes being \"international economics\" is presented as a single theme, which would still adhere to the comma-separated rule if thought of as a single item list. \n\nThere is additional explanatory text provided by the chatbot, which is not part of the required output format per the description. According to the description, only the extracted elements in the specified format should be provided: \n\n- Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n- People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\n- Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_topics>\n- General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_themes>\n\nThe breakdown and further explanation are not needed as per the specified format in the description.\n\nTherefore, based on the presence of the extra explanation, the output does not strictly adhere to the required format.\n\nERR"
