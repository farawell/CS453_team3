  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is given in the format specified by the description. It lists the extracted elements under clear headings: \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes,\" with appropriate lists of items following each heading. Each list is presented with elements separated by commas, which fits the description's requirement of a comma-separated list. \n\nWhile the chatbot does add a sentence, \"Let me know if you'd like to analyze any other text!\" at the end, this addition does not violate the format requirement as the primary required information is provided correctly. Therefore, considering the guidelines, the output complies with the chatbot's description.\n\nNo violation. \nOK"
