According to the format specified in the chatbot description, the output should list the extracted elements next to the corresponding labels (\"Company names:\", \"People names:\", etc.) as comma-separated lists. However, for \"Company names\" and \"People names,\" these sections are left empty, with no indication of \"none\" or a similar placeholder to indicate the absence of names. \n\nThe format was expected to be compliant with the description, which includes all listings directly following the labels, even if empty, possibly with an indication that nothing was found. Also, the description didn't mention including an explanation or justification for each category. The presence of these explanations is not required by the description for compliance.\n\nERR"
