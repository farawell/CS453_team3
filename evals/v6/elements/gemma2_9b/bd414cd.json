  "complianceText": "The output includes a breakdown of entities extracted from the text with the sections \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\" as specified in the desired format. The company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes are listed after the respective headings. \n\nHowever, the format issue arises because the company and people names should be provided in the \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" format, which implies a single-line list separated by commas. The chatbot output does not violate this for the company names given that only two items are present. The people names appear correctly formatted as a singular entry which is appropriate for a single name. Finally, specific topics and general themes are listed properly.\n\nSince there is no explicit violation of the format (as \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" is a placeholder and a list of two items in a line satisfies a comma-separated format), the output complies with the given description overall.\n\nOK"
