The description specifies that the output should be in a format with clearly delineated sections:\n\n- Company names should be listed in a \"<comma_separated_list>\" format.\n- People names should follow the same \"<comma_separated_list>\" format.\n- Specific topics and general themes need to be presented in the prescribed format as well.\n\nHowever, the output:\n\n1. Under \"Company names\" and \"People names,\" uses \"-||-\" which implies no entities found instead of providing an empty list format \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" and \"<comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\" respectively. This violates the format requirement specified in the description.\n\nBecause of these format violations, the output does not comply with the expressly stated requirements for presentation. Hence, it results in a decision of non-compliance.\n\nERR"
