  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the chatbot description for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Formatting**: The output does not use the specified format using `<comma_separated_list_of_>` placeholders. Instead, it simply lists the categories with colons and provides answers below them. The description clearly states that the output should be formatted in a specified manner using placeholders, which is not followed in the provided output.\n\n2. **Missing Categories**: While the output contains entries for \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes,\" the \"Company names\" and \"People names\" categories are empty. Although this could be justified by the explanation provided, the format requires that the categories are filled with at least the placeholder, which is not the case here.\n\nThe reasoning that the text lacks company or people names is valid but the placeholders should still have been used in the formatting directive given by the description.\n\nERR"
