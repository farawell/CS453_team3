The format specified in the description requires clear sections for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes with each followed by a comma-separated list if applicable. In the output:\n\n1. The sections for \"Company names\" and \"People names\" appear but are left empty, which may be due to the absence of such elements in the text but cannot be determined without the input.\n2. The \"Specific topics\" section is missing, which should be present even if it remains empty or marked as such.\n3. The \"General themes\" section is present and followed correctly by the list of themes.\n\nThe primary issue is the missing \"Specific topics\" section, which indicates non-compliance with the requested format.\n\nERR"
