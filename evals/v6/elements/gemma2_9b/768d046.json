It breaks down the entities into sections: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes, using comma-separated lists where appropriate. Each section title is followed by a colon and the extracted information. However, the description requires that the output follows the format with only extractions and not include any additional commentary or invitations for further interaction. The additional line, \"Let me know if you'd like me to analyze a different text!\" does not comply with the described format of output, which makes it a violation.\n\nERR"
