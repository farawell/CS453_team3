  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output specifies a breakdown of entities into company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, there are discrepancies in the desired format for the company names and people names sections. According to the description:\n\n- For company names and people names, the output should follow the format: \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" and \"People names: -||-\".\n\nIn the provided output, instead of using a consistent format with \"comma_separated_list_of_company_names\" or \"-||-\", the output uses a bullet point and an additional explanatory note, deviating from the specified format.\n\nDue to these inconsistencies in adhering to the specified output format, the output does not fully comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
