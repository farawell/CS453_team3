  "complianceText": "The output from the chatbot partially complies with the expected format but has violations in the desired structure. Here's a breakdown of the evaluation:\n\n1. **Company names section:** The expected format is \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\". However, the output for company names is just \"-||-\", which seems like an attempt to indicate no data, but it's not formatted as described.\n\n2. **People names section:** The format \"People names: -||-\" was aimed to ensure consistency, but here it's listed in a bullet form and not a comma-separated list as expected.\n\n3. **Specific topics and General themes sections:** Both sections have correct entities but are formatted incorrectly. The expected format requires \"-||-\" for no entries and comma-separated lists otherwise.\n\n4. **Additional Text (Let me know if you have any other texts you'd like me to analyze!):** The chatbot includes an extra line that's not part of the desired format. The description specifies the format distinctly, and this sentence is extraneous.\n\nThese inconsistencies demonstrate a lack of adherence to all the prescribed structural guidelines. Thus, the output does not comply with the description requirements. \n\nERR"
