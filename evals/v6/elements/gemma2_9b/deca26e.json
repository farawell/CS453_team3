  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is not compliant with the description provided. The desired format for the output should list company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes as comma-separated lists. However, the section for company names is incomplete as it is entirely missing, whereas the section for people names is also missing any content. Additionally, the chatbot includes an additional line, \"Let me know if you'd like me to process a different text!\" which is not part of the desired output format specified in the description. Therefore, the output does not fully conform to the expected structure.\n\nERR"
