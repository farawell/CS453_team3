  "complianceText": "The chatbot output needs to be evaluated for its compliance with the description provided. The desired format specified in the description clearly indicates that the extracted elements should be presented as comma-separated lists. However, the output lists \"Global warming\" under \"Specific topics\" and two items under \"General themes\" in a bullet-point format, not as comma-separated lists. Additionally, the \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections use the \"-||-\" placeholder, which is acceptable for indicating no content to extract, assuming the input text had none. \n\nThus, the key issue here is that the output violates the desired format for listing items, especially under the \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" categories. The appropriate format, as per the description, should use comma-separated lists rather than bullet points.\n\nERR"
