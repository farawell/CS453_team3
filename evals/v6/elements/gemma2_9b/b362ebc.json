  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is organized according to the desired format outlined in the description. It separates and lists the extracted categories as specified: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. The format used is consistent with the prescribed structure of using headings for each category followed by a comma-separated list of items. The only deviation is the formatting, where the chatbot used \"**\" for bolding headings instead of using `<comma_separated_list_of...>`, but this is not explicitly defined in the format requirements provided. Since there's no requirement to evaluate correctness or assess whether all entities were extracted accurately without the input, based solely on format adherence and structure, the output complies with the description.\n\nOK"
