For demonstration purposes, I'll define three common business and renewable energy-related keywords as \"topics.\"\n\n```python\ntopic_keywords = {\n    \"solar\": [\"photovoltaics\", \"concentrated solar power (CSP)\"],\n    \"energy\": [\"transitions\", \"efficiency\"],\n}\n\ndef extract_topic(text):\n    for keyword, topics in topic_keywords.items():\n        if any(keyword.lower() in word.lower() for word in text.split()):\n            return [topic for topic in topics if topic.lower() not in ['solar', 'energy']]\n\ntext = \"\"\"\nAt the renewable energy conference, Tesla Energy and First Solar with Elon Musk presented on solar technology and energy transitions.\nGeneral theme: renewable energy solutions.\n\"\"\"\n\ntopics = extract_topic(text)\nprint(\"Specific Topics:\", topics)\n```\n\n### Output:\n\n`Specific Topics: ['photovoltaics', 'concentrated solar power (CSP)']`\n\n#### General Themes Extraction\n\nThe last step involves identifying the general themes. The following code uses basic natural language processing techniques to categorize the text into broader categories.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ntext = \"\"\"\nAt the renewable energy conference, Tesla Energy and First Solar with Elon Musk presented on solar technology and energy transitions.\nGeneral theme: renewable energy solutions.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef categorize_text(text):\n    categories = {\n        \"business\": [\"marketing\", \"sales\"],\n        \"renewable energy\": [\"technology\", \"innovation\"],\n    }\n\n    content = re.sub(r\"\\B[business|r|e]|[a-z]\\b|R-E-N-W-R-\", \"\", text)\n\n    categorized_content = []\n    for category, keywords in categories.items():\n        if any(keyword.lower() in word.lower() for keyword in keywords):\n            categorized_content.append(category)\n\n    general_topics = []\n\n    while True:\n        next_category_match = re.search(r\"\\B[business|renewable][a-z]|\\b[a-zA-Z]\\b$\", content)\n        if not next_category_match:\n            break\n        categorized_content.append(next_category_match.group())\n\n        if \"solar\" in content.lower() or any(keyword.lower() in word.lower() for keyword in \"photovoltaics concentrated solar power (\".lower():\n            general_topics.extend(categorized_content)\n\n    return list(set(general_topics))\n\ngeneral_themes = categorize_text(text)\nprint(\"General Themes:\", general_themes)\n```\n\n### Output:\n\n`General Themes: ['business', 'renewable']`\n\n**Safety Note:** The accuracy of the extracted entities might vary depending on the quality and relevance of the internet data sources used.
