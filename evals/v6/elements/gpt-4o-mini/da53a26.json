  "complianceText": "The output almost adheres to the desired format described, which is essential for compliance. It follows the order of extraction: company names are listed first, followed by placeholders for people names and specific topics. Finally, a general theme is stated.\n\nHowever, the separator for the list entries is not consistent with the description format. Specifically, for \"People names\" and \"Specific topics,\" the output uses \"-||-\" which is correct according to the description. However, for the \"General themes,\" the output simply states a theme without using the comma-separated list or the \"-||-\" placeholder. This inconsistency leads to a formatting violation in the last category as the desired format specifies that each of the four categories should follow a consistent and distinct format.\n\nDue to this inconsistency in adhering to the described format, specifically in the \"General themes\" section, the output does not fully comply with the description provided.\n\nERR"
