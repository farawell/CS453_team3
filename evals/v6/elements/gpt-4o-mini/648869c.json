According to the rules, even if there are no company names or people names to be extracted, the format still requires an entry after \"Company names:\" and \"People names:\". The output, however, does not include a placeholder (such as \"none\" or a similar note) or any content after \"Company names:\". This absence of an explicit placeholder or note makes it non-compliant since the format is not strictly followed. Additionally, the missing comma-separated list format after \"Company names:\" violates the desired format.\n\nERR"
