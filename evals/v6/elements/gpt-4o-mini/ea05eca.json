According to the description, each category (Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes) should have items listed in a comma-separated format. However, the \"Company names\" section is missing entirely; it is present as a label but contains no content or placeholder. \n\nThe \"People names\" section follows the placeholder format \"-||-\", which is correct if there are indeed no people names to extract from the text. The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections follow the comma-separated format, which is compliant with the description. However, if the input had company names, the lack of listing them counts as a violation.\n\nThe key violation here is the absence of the \"Company names\" content while keeping the label, which implies there should be content or a deliberate indication that no content is applicable (e.g., using the placeholder \"-||-\").\n\nERR"
