  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output must contain lists in the specified format for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. In this provided output:\n\n1. The \"Company names\" section is left entirely blank, which implies either there were no company names to extract or that the extraction was not performed. It's ambiguous but doesn't necessarily violate the format if no company names were present.\n2. Similarly, the \"People names\" and \"Specific topics\" sections are also left blank, under the same assumption.\n3. The \"General themes\" section contains a phrase \"No specific rules governing text.\" This does not adhere to the expected output when no themes are present. It should be blank under the description.\n\nThe presence of text in the \"General themes\" section that does not match the expected output format (i.e., being blank if no themes are present) is a clear deviation from the format specified in the description.\n\nERR"
