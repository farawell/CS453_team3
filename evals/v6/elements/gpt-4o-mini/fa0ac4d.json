The output must provide a comma-separated list under \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" While the format for \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" seems correct, the sections for \"Company names\" and \"People names\" are left blank, which does not conform to the expected output. Even if there were no entities to extract, the description suggests a list form, which could be a placeholder like \"None\" or simply a comma-separated empty string, though the description is not explicit about how to handle zero entities. The desired format indicates a need for consistency in structure across all categories.\n\nERR"
