However, the General themes section contains entries: \"Conceptual elaborations, mystical illusions.\" Therefore:\n\nThe output is supposed to mention company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes in a comma-separated list after each label. All sections should be filled with comma-separated values if any data is extracted. Although the General themes section contains entries, the other sections such as Company names, People names, and Specific topics are left empty, which might be acceptable if no entities fit the criteria, but without input, we cannot determine if those sections indeed had no information to extract. However, since there is no actual rule violation shown in the format itself in terms of the sequence or labeling, the structure is technically adhered to.\n\nOK"
