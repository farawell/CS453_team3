  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output complies with the description format. Each category (Company names, People names, Specific topics, General themes) is clearly listed with their respective extracted elements. The description specifies the desired format should list company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes, separated by commas if more than one per category. In this output:\n\n- \"Company names\" are listed as \"IMF, World Bank,\"\n- \"People names\" are given as \"Jenny Lee,\"\n- \"Specific topics\" include \"global trade policies, economic stability,\"\n- \"General themes\" is \"international economics.\"\n\nThese all follow the pattern outlined in the description, representing a comma-separated list for categories that have multiple entries and single entries without any separator for those with one. Even if I were to evaluate the alignment of content with the desired categories according to the text, without the input text, this cannot be assessed explicitly. However, no violations are present in terms of the requested structure and order.\n\nOK"
