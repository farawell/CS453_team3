Each category is followed by an empty space, indicating that no entities were extracted for any of the categories.\n\nAccording to the desired format specified in the description, each category should be followed by a comma-separated list of relevant entities extracted from the text. However, if the analysis of the text concludes that there are no entities to be extracted for any of these categories, leaving the space empty can be considered as compliance with the description.\n\nThe format in the output complies with the prescribed structure: \"Category: <comma_separated_list>\" even though the list is empty.\n\nTherefore, the output adheres to the specified format and no specific violations are detected.\n\nOK"
