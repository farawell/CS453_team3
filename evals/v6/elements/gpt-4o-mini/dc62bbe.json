The desired format outlined requires the output to include a list of company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes, each separated by commas and presented in the order specified.\n\n1. **Company Names**: The section for \"Company names\" is present but left empty. While this might be acceptable if there are no company names to extract, it would require knowledge of the input text to verify correctness, which is not available for evaluation. Assuming the format is adhered to and remains consistent with no speculations, this does not automatically violate the format rules.\n\n2. **People Names**: The section for \"People names\" is marked with \"-||-\". This appears to conform to the placeholder recognition inline with the expectation for cases where specific elements may not be present in the text. \n\n3. **Specific Topics**: The output correctly lists specific topics as \"artificial intelligence, quantum computing\", using a comma-separated format.\n\n4. **General Themes**: The output lists the general themes as \"technology, future advancements\", adhering to the comma-separated format.\n\nThe output generally follows the described format, including placeholder usage where applicable, and arranges the information in the appropriate requested order. Given the information present, there is no explicit deviation from the format or steps outlined by the chatbot description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
