According to the description, the output should contain all extracted elements in a specific order: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. Each category should have its corresponding extracted elements.\n\n- **Company names**: The output provides this category but leaves it empty. This is a compliant format as there are no checks required for correctness without input.\n- **People names**: Similarly, this list is included in the output but left empty, which still respects the compliance of the format.\n- **Specific topics**: This category is correctly filled with topics such as \"resilience, adaptation, business\".\n- **General themes**: This is also correctly filled with themes like \"resilience in business, adaptation strategies\".\n\nThe critical factor here is that each category is present and separated, even if some of them are empty, since we're not verifying the correctness of the extracted content without the original input. Therefore, the output simply needs to conform to the desired format, which it does.\n\nNo violations are present in terms of the format provided in the instructions.\n\nOK"
