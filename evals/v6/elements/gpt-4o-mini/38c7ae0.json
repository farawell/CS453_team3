Instead, it has left the \"Company names:\" section blank. According to the description, a comma-separated list is required, even if no companies are found (which cannot be determined without the input text).\n\n2. **Overall Formatting**: The output adheres to the specified structure by listing the elements in the desired order. However, the format for the \"Company names\" field is not correctly followed as it is empty and should contain at least a placeholder if no company names are to be mentioned.\n\nBecause of the violation found in the format for the \"Company names\" field, the output does not entirely comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
