According to the described format, the extracted elements should be listed as: \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\", \"People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\", \"Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\", \"General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\". In the given output, the \"Company names\", \"People names\", and \"Specific topics\" sections correctly lead with the appropriate labels, but no content is provided after them, which is acceptable if there are no entities to extract. However, the \"General themes\" section includes a phrase, \"Void of recognized elements, omission, contexts,\" instead of a list format, which does not comply with the stipulated desired format of a \"<comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>.\"\n\nERR"
