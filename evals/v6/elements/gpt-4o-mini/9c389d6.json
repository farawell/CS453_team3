The desired format is:\n\n- Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n- People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\n- Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\n- General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n\nThe output correctly contains the headings \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\". Each section is present, and the specific topics and general themes are listed after their respective headings. \n\nHowever, there is a potential issue with the section for company names and people names, as they are left empty. According to the description, the chatbot should extract these entities if available. Since we don't know the input, we cannot determine if any company or people names were indeed present in the text. Therefore, we cannot conclude a violation based solely on the absence of names without knowing the input text.\n\nGiven the limitation of not having the input, the output cannot be judged erroneous based on the format provided. Hence, the compliance is maintained as per the information available.\n\nOK"
