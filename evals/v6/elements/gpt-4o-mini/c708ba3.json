  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot output is based on the requirements outlined in the description. \n\n1. The output starts with \"Company names:\", followed by an empty space, which does follow the format, though it indicates no company names have been extracted. While it's unknown if this is correct without the input, it is formatted appropriately.\n\n2. The same applies to \"People names:\" and \"Specific topics:\". They each have a correctly formatted header, with no content following presumably because none was extracted or available.\n\n3. For \"General themes:\", it lists \"Ideas, Tokens, Purity\" which aligns with the format of a comma-separated list as specified in the description.\n\nOverall, the output adheres to the required format as detailed in the description. \n\nOK"
