  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is expected to include four sections: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. According to the provided description, each section should be explicitly listed with extracted elements in a comma-separated format. \n\nIn the chatbot's output:\n\n1. The \"Company names\" section is present but is left empty.\n2. The \"People names\" section is also present but left empty.\n3. The \"Specific topics\" section is present but left empty.\n4. The \"General themes\" section includes \"Truce, gestures, communication.\"\n\nBased on the description, the format is met because each section is listed explicitly, even though the first three sections are empty. The description does not specify that the presence of elements in each category is mandatory, only that they should be extracted and listed if present. Therefore, the compliance here relates solely to the adherence to format as instructed in the description. Given that the output maintains the correct structure, it is compliant with the format specified.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
