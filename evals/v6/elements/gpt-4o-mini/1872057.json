Instead of providing a list or stating \"none\", it uses \"-||-\" to represent it. According to the desired format, \"-||-\" is supposed to be used for lists of company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. In this instance, there is an expectation that if there are no people names, it should explicitly state \"none\" or provide an empty list, rather than using \"-||-\".\n\nERR"
