  "complianceText": "Upon evaluating the chatbot's output, the format specified in the description is not fully complied with. The desired format requires each category (Company names, People names, Specific topics, General themes) to be presented with lists, separated by commas if there are multiple items. However, even if the lists are empty, they must still be acknowledged with a placeholder or indication that no items were extracted in those categories. In this particular output:\n\n1. \"Company names:\" and \"People names:\" are left blank without any indication or placeholder for absence of entities, whereas a comma-separated list is expected with a placeholder such as \"None\" if the list is empty.\n2. \"Specific topics:\" and \"General themes:\" both have comma-separated lists as expected.\n\nThe primary violation comes from the absence of any placeholders or indicators for the empty \"Company names\" and \"People names\" categories, which does not align with the expected output format described.\n\nERR"
