However, the \"Company names\" and \"Specific topics\" lists are empty and should follow the format given, even if empty. Specifically, they should be represented as \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" and \"<comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\" respectively. The output does not comply with this desired format as the lists for these sections are completely omitted, leaving empty lines. Also, all elements must be placed after the text \"Company names:\", \"People names:\", etc., but in this case \"Company names:\" and \"Specific topics:\" do not have placeholders or commas to indicate an empty list.\n\nERR"
