  "complianceText": "The chatbot output partially complies with the described format. It adheres to the correct structure for listing company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. Each category is clearly identified and separated by a colon, which matches the format outlined in the description. However, there is a discrepancy. The descriptions expect lists to be in a comma-separated format for each category, as indicated by \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" and so forth. While \"Company names\" is singular, which could imply there is only one name, the expected format implies readiness for comma separation. This expectation is not fulfilled since there are no commas separating the items within any of the lists (for People names or Specific topics), except if the categorical list consists of only one item, which isn't the case here. Since compliance with the format is not fully met, it constitutes a violation of the given specification.\n\nERR"
