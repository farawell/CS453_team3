However, all the categories are left empty. While the chatbot does maintain the structure of the output as per the description, it should ideally have detected or listed something within each category, based on the input text provided to it. Since we cannot evaluate the correctness of the extracted elements without the input text, we only focus on whether the format is followed.\n\nIn this case, the format is followed correctly, because each section is listed according to the specified desired format, even though they are empty. The chatbot output complies with the steps to extract the information and presents it properly as instructed in the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
