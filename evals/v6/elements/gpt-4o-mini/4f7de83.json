The list for \"Company names\" should have been provided in a comma-separated format, but it is left empty. Additionally, the dash separators |-||-| used in \"People names\" don't match the specified comma-separated list format when the list is empty; it should be an explicit statement acknowledging that no company or people names were extracted. This indicates a failure to adhere strictly to the format requirements outlined in the description.\n\nERR"
