According to the description, the desired format is to list Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes, each as a comma-separated list. In this output, the \"Company names\" section is empty, which may be acceptable if there are no company names in the text, but the issue lies primarily with the missing formatting in the subsequent sections. Each section should still maintain the \"comma_separated_list_of_\" format or at least indicate that there are none found, not just using \"-||-\".\n\nERR"
