However, there is a compliance violation based on the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Company Names Section**: The output provides \"Company names:\" with no accompanying list, not even indicating an absence explicitly. It is acceptable for no company names to be mentioned, but the format requires some indication of presence or absence.\n\n2. **People Names Section**: The output lists \"People names: -||-\", which is compliant as it indicates the format correctly even if no names are mentioned.\n\n3. **Specific Topics Section**: The output lists specific topics as \"Specific topics: Cryptocurrency, blockchain\", which follows the specified format correctly.\n\n4. **General Themes Section**: The output lists general themes as \"General themes: Future of technology, Innovation in finance\", which also follows the specified format.\n\nThe issue lies in the \"Company names\" section where the format is not adhered to properly. All sections should follow the format where any missing content should still use the \"-||-\" indication from the description.\n\nERR"
