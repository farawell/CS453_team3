  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot output is based on its compliance with the specified desired format. The output should follow this structure:\n\n1. **Company names**: Should be a comma-separated list of company names.\n2. **People names**: Should be a comma-separated list of people names.\n3. **Specific topics**: Should be a comma-separated list of specific topics.\n4. **General themes**: Should be a comma-separated list of general overarching themes.\n\nExamining the provided output:\n\n- The section for \"Company names\" includes \"Stanford, Berkeley\". These are likely to be universities rather than companies, but without knowing the input, we cannot confirm this. However, it's crucial to note that the section should only consist of company names.\n- The \"People names\" section lists \"Dr. Jane Doe\", which is formatted correctly with a single name.\n- The \"Specific topics\" section lists \"artificial intelligence, computational theory\", which follows the desired comma-separated format.\n- The \"General themes\" section lists \"higher education, research\", which also follows the desired comma-separated format.\n\nThe main issue is with the \"Company names\" section, as the names provided are potentially not companies. Without input context, this section appears not to comply with the description that specifies company names.\n\nERR"
