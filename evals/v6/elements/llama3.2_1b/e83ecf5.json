However, the output lists these elements in bullet-point format. \n\nSpecifically:\n- **Company names**: Instead of a comma-separated list, it is presented as:\n  - Penguin Random House\n  - Simon & Schuster\n- **People names**:\n  - Margaret Atwood\n  - George Martin\n- **Specific topics**:\n  - Storytelling\n  - Book Publishing\n- **General themes**:\n  - Literary Arts\n\nThese are all in a bullet-point list rather than in the required comma-separated list format.
