  "complianceText": "Upon examining the chatbot's output, I observe the following:\n\n1. **Format Issue**: The output is required to adhere to a specific format dictated in the description. For each category (Company names, People names, Specific Topics, and General Themes), the list should be separated by commas and follow the format: `<comma_separated_list>`. The \"n/a\" used in Company Names does not adhere to the desired format of a comma-separated empty list. Similarly, the addition of bullet points under People Names, Specific Topics, and General Themes categories instead of a comma-separated string, violates the specified output format. The output for each list should be on a single line with elements separated by commas, but the chatbot's output uses bullet points which is incorrect.\n\n2. **Repetition of separator**: For People Names, Specific Topics, and General Themes, the separator -||- is repeated unnecessarily. It should appear once after the category title, but not before each item in the list.\n\nBased on the above observations, the output does not comply with the description format and conventions. \n\nERR"
