However, the output does not strictly adhere to the desired format specified in the description:\n\n1. **Company names**: The output provides a list of company names, but they are separated by line breaks instead of a comma-separated list as required by the desired format.\n   \n2. **People names**: The output correctly provides a list of people names, but they are on separate lines rather than in a comma-separated list as specified.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The format is correct for the specific topics, although the adherence to the desired format isn't clear since the format specified in the guidelines was '-||-'.\n\n4. **General themes**: The output correctly displays a theme without visible formatting issues.\n\nThe primary non-compliance issues revolve around the required formatting (using `<comma_separated_list>` rather than line breaks) for both company names and people names. These deviations from the specified format lead to non-compliance with the description provided.\n\nERR"
