  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the desired format outlined in the description. According to the description, the format for listing entities should be:\n\n- Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n- People names: -||-\n- Specific topics: -||-\n- General themes: -||-\n\nThere are several issues here:\n\n1. **People Names:** The output uses \"- ||-\" instead of the exact format \"-||-\". There should be no spaces between the hyphen and the vertical bars.\n\n2. **Company Names:** While the description's format allows for \"(none found)\" if no company names are detected, it does not specify the same placeholder for the other categories if none are found.\n\n3. **Specific Topics and General Themes:** There is a formatting inconsistency with a colon missing after \"Specific Topics\" and additional text \"(only one topic match)\" that is not in alignment with the described format. Also, \"innovation\" and \"resilience\" should respectively be listed after colons.\n\nBased on these observations, the output does not fully comply with the description.\n\nERR"
