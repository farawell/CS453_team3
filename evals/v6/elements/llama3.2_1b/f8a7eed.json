  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not fully comply with the desired format as described. The format specifies that each category (Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes) should contain elements formatted as \"<comma_separated_list_of_elements>\". However, the format for the People Names category is shown as \"-||-\", which does not follow the desired comma-separated list format. Furthermore, the list of Specific Topics is presented as a bullet point list, not a comma-separated list. General Themes seem to be presented correctly as a comma-separated list since there is only one theme identified; however, it still diverges from the specified format because each item is on a new line and not separated by commas. Therefore, 'ERR' should be returned. \n\nERR"
