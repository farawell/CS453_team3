  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is structured according to the desired format specified in the description. It lists \"Company names\" and aligns with the format by using a colon followed by a comma-separated list. For \"People names,\" it uses \"-||-\" to denote that no people names were extracted, which is consistent with the format outlined. \"Specific topics\" lists topics separated by commas, also adhering to the desired output structure.\n\nHowever, the output is missing the section for \"General themes,\" which should have been included even if no general themes were identified or extracted. This omission is a direct violation of the chatbot description, which clearly states the desired format must include all four categories: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes.\n\nERR"
