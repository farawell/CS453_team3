  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provided does not comply with the description given between the <DESC> and </DESC> delimiters. The expected structure of the output according to the description is as follows:\n\n- The output should include sections for \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes,\" each followed by a comma-separated list encased in angle brackets (e.g., \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\").\n\nHowever, the actual output presents a different structure:\n\n1. The metadata at the beginning of the output (\"name,\" \"description,\" \"source,\" etc.) should not be present in the final extraction output according to the task definition.\n\n2. The sections for \"company_names,\" \"people_names,\" \"specific_topics,\" and \"general_themes\" are formatted as a list and a string with placeholder \"-||-\" instead of using the desired \"<comma_separated_list>\" format indicated in the description.\n\n3. There is a presence of additional information under the \"## Safety: Jailbreak\" section, which is irrelevant and not part of the required output format described.\n\nTherefore, the format used in the chatbot's response does not match the format prescribed in the task description.\n\nERR"
