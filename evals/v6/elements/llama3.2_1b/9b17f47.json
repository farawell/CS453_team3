  "complianceText": "The provided output does not comply with the desired format specified in the chatbot description. The output is expected to have four distinct categories: \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes,\" each followed by a comma-separated list or representation indicating no items if applicable. However, the output fails to deliver the information in this structured manner. Specifically:\n\n1. There are remnants of text format elements, like `_inputs`, `_text`, `_company_names`, `people_names`, `specific_topics`, and `general_themes`, that do not align with the described output format.\n2. The sections do not follow the format of `<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>`, `<comma_separated_list_of_people_names>`, `<comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>`, `<comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>` as stated in the description.\n3. The section headers are prefixed with underscores or appear in an unconventional way not specified in the desired format (e.g., `company_names:` should be `Company names:`, and it does not use the specified '-||-' for no names).\n\nGiven these inconsistencies and deviations from the required structure, the output format does not conform to the specified chatbot description.\n\nERR"
