According to the expectations stated in the description, the output should use the format where lists are comma-separated and each category must be clearly presented in the following format:\n\n- **Company names:** <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n- **People names:** <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\n- **Specific topics:** <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\n- **General themes:** <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n\nSpecifically, the violations are:\n\n1. **People Names Section**: The output uses \"- || -\" as a placeholder for \"People Names.\" The description requires the use of a comma-separated list format and should have been represented consistently like the \"Company Names\" section, if there were no names to mention.\n\n2. **Company Names Section**: Although the \"Company Names\" section correctly displays \"(empty list)\" to denote no company names were found, ideally it should follow the same naming convention as the others (such as positioning the list under \"Company names:\").\n\n3. **Specific Topics and General Themes Formatting**: These sections properly contain specific topics and general themes respectively, but the format should consistently use the same line format with identifiers followed by a comma-separated list.\n\nBecause these inconsistencies in formatting deviate from the prescribed output format in the description, the output does not fully meet the requirements.\n\nERR"
