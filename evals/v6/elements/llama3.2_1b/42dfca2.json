  "complianceText": "The chatbot output lists extracted elements organized under four categories as per the required format. The categories are: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. However, the format of listing \"None found specific company names mentioned in the text\" under \"Company names\" deviates from the expected format of a comma-separated list. Instead, it should directly indicate the absence of company names with something like \"Company names: \", leaving it blank if no companies were found. Thus, the chatbot output does not fully comply with the specified format described.\n\nERR"
