According to the description, the format should strictly have headers followed by a list format using the pattern <comma_separated_list_of_...>. \n\nIn the chatbot's output, the lists for \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\" do not adhere to this specific desired format of comma-separated values. Even if there is only one entity under any of these categories, it should still technically conform to the format description, which states that it should be a comma-separated list. No commas are present between items either.\n\nTherefore, the entry violations concern the formatting requirements as indicated by the description. The chatbot output must comply with this detailed format requirement despite any additional information or complexity within the text.\n\nERR"
