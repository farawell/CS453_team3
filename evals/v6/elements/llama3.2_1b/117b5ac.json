  "output": "Here are the extracted elements of the text in the desired format:\n\n**Company names:** Sundance Film Festival, Cannes Film Festival\n**People names:** Christopher Nolan, Sofia Coppola\n**Specific topics:** Film industry innovation\n**General themes:** Film festival, narrative techniques, cinematography",

  "complianceText": "My evaluation of the chatbot output focuses on whether it adheres to the specified format in the description. The description outlines a distinct format for extracting information from the text, requiring identifiers for various categories of extracted elements.\n\n1. The description specifies that the extracted elements should be presented in the following format:\n   - **Company names:** followed by a comma-separated list of company names.\n   - **People names:** followed by a comma-separated list of people names.\n   - **Specific topics:** followed by a comma-separated list of specific topics.\n   - **General themes:** followed by a comma-separated list of general overarching themes.\n\n2. The output provided does not use comma-separated lists for any of the categories. Instead, the items are separated by commas, but not using a comma separated list format explicitly. Although they are essentially comma-separated, standard representation using comma-separated value lists typically lacks decoration or additional formatting (bolding). \n\n3. Besides this, the use of bold formatting is not mandated nor suggested in the description. The description asks for a clear format with identifiers (like \"Company names:\"), followed by the list.\n\nGiven these observations, there is a violation in the sense that the output does not strictly conform to the \"comma_separated_list_of_company_names\" format as described. While the core information structure is present, the precise format outlined is not adhered to, particularly with regard to how elements are listed and formatted.\n\nERR"
