  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description provided. Here's why:\n\n1. **Formatting**: The output does not follow the specified format as described in the description. The description requires a comma-separated list enclosed within angle brackets (\"<\", \">\"). However, the output uses asterisks (*) to list company names and does not use angle brackets.\n   \n2. **Use of \"-||-\"**: The bot uses \"-||-\" correctly where there are no people names to list.\n\n3. **Specific topics and General themes**: These sections are presented in lists (though not in comma-separated lists), without the required angle brackets.\n\nOverall, the output fails to adhere to the precise formatting standards set forth in the description, specifically with the use of angle brackets. \n\nERR"
