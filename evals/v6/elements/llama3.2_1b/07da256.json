  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot follows the desired format outlined in the description. The output includes clearly labeled sections for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes, each listing their respective contents. The format adheres to the delimiters and structure specified.\n\nThe evaluation criteria required that the output be formatted as:\n- \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\"\n- \"People names: -||-\"\n- \"Specific topics: -||-\"\n- \"General themes: -||-\"\n\nTherefore, the part of evaluating the output is to check adherence to this formatting. The output uses:\n- Bulleted format for listing items rather than a comma-separated list, which does not comply with the specific format requirements for listing entities.\n\nThe description strictly asks for a comma-separated list, which is not met as the chatbot used bullet points instead. The output violated the specified format requirement.\n\nERR"
