Here are the identified violations:\n\n1. **Format Compliance**: The output is not formatted according to the desired format. The description requires:\n   - \"Company names: \\<comma_separated_list_of_company_names\\>\"\n   - \"People names: -||-\"\n   - \"Specific topics: -||-\"\n   - \"General themes: -||-\"\n   In the output, \"Company Names\" and \"People Names\" do not follow the formatting explicitly mentioned. Specifically, \"Company names\" should be a comma-separated list, but here the names are in bullet point format which indicates people names are incorrectly listed under company names. \n\n2. **Structural Compliance**: \"People Names\" and \"Specific Topics\" contain bullet points, which is inconsistent with the expectation of a comma-separated list and \"-||-\" as an indicator respectively as nothing extra should be used. \n\n3. **Missing or Incorrect Delimiters**: \n   - For \"Specific Topics\" and \"General Themes\", the prefix \"-||-\" is missing as specified in the desired format instructions.\n   - \"General themes\" uses a different prefix \"General themes:\" which should be '-||-' according to example.\n\nDue to these violations, the output does not comply with the description's explicit formatting requirements.\n\nERR"
