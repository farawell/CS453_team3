The relevant part of the output follows.\n\nIn the output:\n- The section intended for \"Company names\" is filled with \"-||-\", following the specified format of a comma-separated list; thus, compliant.\n- The section for \"People names\" lists \"Kevin Mitnick\" but does so incorrectly. It uses \"||-\" instead of \"-||-\" or a comma, which violates the specified output format for names.\n- The section intended for \"Specific topics\" uses \"-||-\", which follows the specified format.\n- The section for \"General themes\" also uses \"-||-\", which follows the specified format.\n\nThe primary violation here is with the \"People names\" section, where the formatting deviates from the specified \"-||-\" pattern. The inclusion of metadata before the output also represents a lack of adherence to the expected format for displaying extracted information. \n\nERR"
