  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not fully comply with the description. While it attempts to adhere to the desired format, there are several discrepancies:\n\n1. **Format Issues**: The desired format specifies a comma-separated list for each category. The output should read \"Company names: Sony Music, Universal\" even if these are considered groups, and the names should not include additional commentary about them being \"a group.\" Similarly, the output for \"People names\" should be in a comma-separated format, i.e., \"People names: Beyoncé, Taylor Swift.\"\n\n2. **Missing Lists**: For \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes,\" the output lists these in a paragraph format with bullet points, which is inconsistent with the specified format, but this cannot be checked as this may rely on the input. Cannot be not compliant for this.\n\nDue to the non-compliance with the expected formatting in the output, there is a violation.\n\nERR"
