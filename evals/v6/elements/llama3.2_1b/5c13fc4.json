However, the sentence \"Note that there is no mention of Neil deGrasse Tyson or his affiliation with these entities\" does not comply with the description because such commentary is unnecessary and deviates from the required format. The description only requests the extraction of elements and their presentation in the desired format, nothing more. This addition is extraneous and not part of the output requirements.\n\nERR"
