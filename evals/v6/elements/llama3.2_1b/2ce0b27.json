Instead, the chatbot output uses a bullet list format for each category, which does not comply with the given format requirement.\n\n2. **Sections Included**: The output includes four sections: Company Names, People Names, Specific Topics, and General Themes, aligning with the required categories mentioned in the description. This shows adherence to the categorization outlined.\n\nAlthough the content is organized under each required heading, the format of these entries (using bullet points instead of a comma-separated list) constitutes a non-compliance with the expected output format.\n\nERR"
