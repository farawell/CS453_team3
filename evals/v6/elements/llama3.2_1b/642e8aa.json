  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description provided. The description clearly specifies the desired format in which the extracted elements should be presented:\n\n- Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n- People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\n- Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_topics>\n- General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_themes>\n\nHowever, the output provided by the chatbot includes a mixed and unordered format, and does not adhere to the structured list format as specified. The list is not comma-separated and it mixes the categories. Additionally, the output breaks the categories down inaccurately (e.g., mixing themes and topics), and includes annotations and interpretations that were not requested (e.g., sentences explaining the terms rather than listing them). Extra ambiguous explanations are provided that divert from the format required in the description. \n\nERR"
