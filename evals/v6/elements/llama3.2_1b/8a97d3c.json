  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output partially follows the desired format, as specified in the description. The format requires a comma-separated list enclosed within each of the metadata fields, namely \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" The current output does not comply with this format for a few reasons: \n\n1. The field \"Company names\" presents a list format rather than a comma-separated list as requested.\n2. The field \"People names\" uses \"-||-\" as a placeholder although it expected a comma-separated list, likely due to no people names being extracted. This approach is not directly specified in the description.\n3. For \"Specific topics,\" a single topic is mentioned without adhering to the comma-separated list format.\n4. For \"General themes,\" there is only one theme mentioned, but it also does not comply with the format, as it does not use commas, even though there is only one theme.\n\nDue to these reasons, the output does not comply with the specified description format.\n\nERR"
