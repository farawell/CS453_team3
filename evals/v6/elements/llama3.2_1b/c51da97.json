  "complianceText": "The output format does not fully comply with the desired format provided in the description. Here are the specific areas where the output deviates:\n\n1. The section for \"People names\" is not properly formatted. It should be a comma-separated list or \"-||-\" to indicate none, but instead, it contains a bullet point. This indicates a formatting error.\n\n2. The section for \"Specific topics\" is missing entirely. The description specifies that this section should be present, even if it is to indicate that there are no specific topics (using \"-||-\"). This absence is a clear compliance failure.\n\n3. The \"General Themes\" section is not correctly formatted. Although themes are listed, the description specifies it should be a single list, not nested with bullet points under a theme. The nested listing here adds unnecessary complexity that does not align with the specified output format.\n\nTaking into account these violations and the necessary compliance with the specified format, the output does not meet the requirements outlined in the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
