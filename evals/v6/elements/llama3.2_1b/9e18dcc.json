  "output": "extract entities from text\ndescription: Extract specific elements of text from a given text to identify notable phrases, names, locations, organizations, and topics.\nsource: https://text-to-extract_entities.pytorch.org/\ninputs:\n  text_types: \n    - strings \n  entity_features: {\n        - \"PERSON\" : \n          - name : []\n      - \"ORG\" : \n          - id : []\n  custom_rules: []\n\n\n\n### Inputs\n\n*   `text`: The input string or text to analyze.\n*   `text_types` (optional): A list of allowed data types for the input string. In this case, we are interested in identifying entities, so we'll consider only strings.\n*   `entity_features` (default: {}): An object mapping entity names to lists containing name information.\n*   `custom_rules` (optional) : This field is used when you want to add custom rules for the text. Currently, it's just an empty list.\n\n### Outputs\n\n-   `important_entities`: A dictionary (or a JSON string if output is intended as strings) of key-value pairs:\n    *   Each key identifies an entity type and its features.\n*   `custom_entities`: An object containing custom rules for specific scenarios. For more information, please check the source link for openai documentation guidelines.\n*   `top_topics`: A list of the most relevant topics detected in the input text. This can help you summarize or analyze the content more effectively.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\nThis code snippet covers basic entity extraction and some minor adjustments based on a provided text:\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom extract_entities import ExtractEntities\n\n# Initialize the extractor instance\nextractor = ExtractEntities('https://text-to-extract_entities.pytorch.org/')\n\n# Analyze an input text string.\nresult = extractor.extract()\nprint(result)\n\n```\n\n### Best Practices\n\nTo work effectively with OpenAI's API, please refer to their documentation:\n*   Always check the API response structure carefully before and during your implementation process. Your code must also handle potential exceptions gracefully for robustness.\n*   It is recommended that you explore all features, modules, and API rules available in OpenAI's documentation to maximize the effectiveness of your integration.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provided here is not compliant with the description given. Hereâ€™s why:\n\n1. **Output Format**: The description specifies a distinct format for the output that includes sections for \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" However, the provided chatbot output does not adhere to this format. It instead discusses something different, mentioning `important_entities`, `custom_entities`, and `top_topics` without aligning them with the required format.\n\n2. **Focus**: The description emphasizes extracting specific elements of text, such as company and people names, in a structured format. The chatbot output focuses more on explaining a broader entity extraction using different elements not detailed in the description.\n\n3. **Mismatch with Description Task**: The output focuses on a coding framework or approach for entity extraction (`extract_entities` module) and references technical details about data types and entity features, which is not within the scope of the task as described. The task description is about extracting specific entities from a text given a directly defined format, not about describing how to implement or code such functionality.\n\nDue to these discrepancies, the conclusion is that the chatbot output does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the description.\n\nERR"
