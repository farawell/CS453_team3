  "complianceText": "The evaluation is focused on assessing whether the output follows the specific format and instructions given in the description. The desired format to be checked is:\n\n```\nCompany names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\nPeople names: -||-\nSpecific topics: -||-\nGeneral themes: -||-\n```\n\n1. **Format Compliance**:\n    - The output begins with a section that appears to be markup metadata, which is not supposed to appear in the desired format.\n    - The company, people, topics, and themes are not listed under clearly marked sections such as \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\". Instead, these entities are listed under keys such as - \"company_names\", the section with specific topics represented as a list ([]), and incorrectly formatted theme with parentheses as \"General(themes)\".\n    \n2. **Repeated Specific Topics**:\n    - The specific topics list contains duplicate entries without seeming justification (e.g., \"Robotics\" is repeated). While repetition might address a point made in the description under \"checking correctness and not compliance\", it still represents a redundancy that is unusual under typical expectations.\n   \n3. **Unusual Characters**:\n    - The names of the sections and their contents do not use the \"-||-\" separator specified in the description. Instead, they incorrectly use list notation.\n\n4. **Safety Section**:\n    - The output inappropriately includes a \"Safety\" section with instructions that do not apply to the extraction task scope, which goes beyond the format described in the description.\n\nConsidering these factors, the output from the chatbot does not comply with the description, mainly due to format violations, additional unexpected sections, and misplaced instructions. \n\nERR"
