According to the description, the desired format should include the headers \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes,\" each followed by a \"<comma_separated_list_of_...>\". The format \"None detected in the given text\" used for company names does not comply with the \"<comma_separated_list_of_...>\" format, and the \"People Names\" section is represented by \"-||-\", which is not appropriate as it was meant to instruct positioning, not two of the same symbols without content. Additionally, the \"Specific Topics\" are not in a comma-separated list format, and the \"General Themes\" are not correctly formatted as a simple list or comma-separated values but instead include a narrative explanation.\n\nERR"
