  "complianceText": "The chatbot output appears to not fully comply with the desired format as described. \n\n1. For \"Company names,\" the output states \"None,\" which is consistent with noting the absence of company names. However, formatting should be adhered to as \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>,\" and if there are none, it should clearly indicate this using the prescribed format or simply leave it empty.\n\n2. For \"People names,\" the entry is “- John Smith-,”  but the explanation that follows is confusing by mentioning that there is one person mentioned but no specific name is provided. Also, there should be a comma-separated list instead of the format provided.\n\n3. \"Specific Topics\" and \"General Themes\" are provided in a list format, which aligns with the description and does not contain apparent violations.\n\nDue to these inconsistencies in format for \"Company names\" and the confusing statement regarding \"People Names,\" I conclude there is a violation.\n\nERR"
