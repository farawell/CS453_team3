The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" are supposed to be formatted as a comma-separated list, like the \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections. However, the output uses a bullet point for the specific topic \"Amazon's latest policies\" instead of listing it in a comma-separated format. \n\n2. The \"General themes\" section is missing entirely in the chatbot output. The description explicitly asks for a list of general overarching themes, which is not present.\n\nDue to these violations, the output does not adhere strictly to the desired format specified in the description.\n\nERR"
