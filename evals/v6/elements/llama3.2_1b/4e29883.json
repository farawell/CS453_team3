This inconsistency is non-compliant with maintaining just the required extraction format.\n   - \"General themes: -||-\" doesn't provide any extracted themes, and no explanation is given, which deviates from the required completion of elements.\n\n3. **Incorrect Output Sections**: The section labeled \"## Final output\" and \"### Explanation\" deviates from the structured format offered in the description. This additional output violates the strict format requirements provided in the description.\n\nThe output provides a list of explanations and additional text not compliant with a simple format requirement, which disrupts the intended extraction summary for easy reading and parsing.\n\nERR"
