  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the specified desired format in the description. There is a clear deviation from the required structure and format. \n\n1. The output does not follow the prescribed format of a comma-separated list. For example, \"People names\" does not use the \"<comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\" format as specified.\n   \n2. An element called \"Unnamed developer or researcher\" is cited under \"People names,\" which is not consistent with the expected entity extraction that should explicitly list names if any are present. If there are no people names to be extracted, the expectation does not account for generic descriptors.\n\nThe elements were not properly structured as outlined. Given these format discrepancies, I conclude that the output violates the description's requirements.\n\nERR"
