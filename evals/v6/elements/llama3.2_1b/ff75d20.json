  "complianceText": "Upon evaluating the chatbot's output, several compliance issues with the description are evident:\n\n1. **Format Compliance**: The output does not comply with the desired format of using \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" for all extracted elements. For \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes,\" the output does not use a comma-separated list. Instead, the list for \"Specific topics\" is space-separated, and \"General themes\" appears as a single entry without a list format.\n\n2. **Consistency in Representation**: The placeholder \"-||-\" is used incorrectly for \"People names\" where there should logically be either a list or an empty placeholder without any erroneous characters.\n\n3. **Structure and Layout**: The format specified in the description indicates that the company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes should be listed consistently with the same layout conventions, which is violated by the mentioned discrepancies.\n\nMy evaluation concludes that the output fails to meet the specific formattin guidelines set forth in the description multiple times.\n\nERR"
