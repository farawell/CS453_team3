  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot output involves assessing whether it adheres to the format and structure as defined in the chatbot description. The description specifies a desired format where information should be categorized under four main headings: \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes,\" with each category listing the respective elements in a \"<comma_separated_list>\" format. The provided output deviates from this expected format in several ways:\n\n1. **Format Compliance**:\n   - The output uses bullet points for listing items under each category instead of a comma-separated list as required by the instructions. Specifically, the company and people names sections indicate \"None mentioned\" using bullet points, which deviates from the expected format.\n   - In the \"Specific Topics\" and \"General Themes,\" items are listed using bullet points instead of the specified comma-separated list format.\n\n2. **Section Headings**:\n   - The output uses the heading \"### Extracted Entities\" instead of directly listing the categories as per the \"Desired format\" outlined in the description.\n\nBased on the above points, the output does not comply with the specified format in the chatbot description. \n\nERR"
