The desired format for the output is clearly stated, with specific elements such as Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes, followed by a colon and a comma-separated list. In the provided output:\n\n1. \"Company names\" and \"People names\" are followed by explanations instead of a comma-separated list or the phrase \"-||-\" when nothing is found. This does not comply with the desired format.\n   \n2. \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" follow the requested list format, but they are provided as bullet points, which does not match the specified comma-separated list format.\n\nThus, the output does not comply with the required format as described, leading to a violation of the chatbotâ€™s description.\n\nERR"
