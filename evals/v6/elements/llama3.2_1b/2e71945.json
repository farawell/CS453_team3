  "complianceText": "The output from the chatbot is mostly compliant with the desired format specified in the description. It lists company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes, which aligns with the required structure. However, there is a slight deviation in the format. The description specifies that each category should be presented as a comma-separated list within a single line, using \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" etc., to denote a placeholder for the lists. Instead, the chatbot has outputted each element on a new line under each category, which doesn't comply with the specified format.\n\nERR"
