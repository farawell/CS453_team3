Specifically, \"general themes\" is misaligned with the desired format (-||-).\n\n3. **Order of Sections**: The order in which the entities are extracted in the output does not match the desired order as mentioned: Company names, People names, Specific topics, General themes. In the output, General themes appear before Specific topics.\n\nThese deviations from the prescribed format and order are clear grounds for determining that the output does not comply with the description.\n\nERR"
