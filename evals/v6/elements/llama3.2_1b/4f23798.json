This is not a comma-separated list and includes names that should likely be under \"People names.\"\n\n2. **People Names**: The output correctly lists people names under its section as:\n   ```\n   - Margaret Thatcher\n   - Winston Churchill\n   ```\n   Although the format deviates from the desired format, it is understandable.\n\n3. **Specific Topics**: The format is not consistent with the required \"-||-\" but presents the information clearly.\n\n4. **General Themes**: Similarly, the format is not compliant with the \"-||-\" requirement.\n\nThe deviations from the specified format for presenting company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes are why the output is considered non-compliant.\n\nERR"
