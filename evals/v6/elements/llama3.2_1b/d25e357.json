  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is being evaluated against the description requirements. The desired format in the description is very specific, requiring a particular structure. Upon examination, the output does not adhere to this structure in several ways:\n\n1. For \"Company names,\" the description specifies a comma-separated list, but the output provides a note \"(No specific company names mentioned)\" instead of using the required placeholder format: \"Company names: -||-\".\n\n2. For \"People names,\" the correct format is provided (\"-||-\"), which aligns with the description when no names are mentioned.\n\n3. Under \"Specific topics,\" the format does not align with the description. It mentions \"Topics like 'escape listing', 'faded topics'\" instead of presenting a comma-separated list of specific topics. The word \"like\" suggests examples, which deviates from the straightforward listing format expected in the output.\n\n4. The \"General themes\" section, although listing themes, needs to strictly correspond to a comma-separated list as suggested by other similar descriptors in the output format. The asterisked list format is not compliant with the format expectations described.\n\nBased on these observations, the output does not conform to the prescribed format and organization as outlined in the description, particularly related to the representation and formatting of the extracted elements.\n\nERR"
