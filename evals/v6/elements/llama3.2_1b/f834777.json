The chatbot description requires the output to be formatted in a specific order and form:\n\n1. **Format**: The output should list each category separated and formatted as a comma-separated list, not bullet points.\n   - The desired output format is:\n     ```\n     Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n     People names: -||-\n     Specific topics: -||-\n     General themes: -||-\n     ```\n   - The current output uses bullet points (\"- \"), which is not compliant with the specified format.\n\nAdditionally, the description implies a specific order for the extraction process and requires entities to be clearly stated even if they are absent (\"Company names: None\") rather than mentioning negative instances like \"none (just a mention...).\" The theme \"Microsoft\" being listed under general themes seems like a misplacement since the company is indirectly noted according to the text.\n\nERR"
