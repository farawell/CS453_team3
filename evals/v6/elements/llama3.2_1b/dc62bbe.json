  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is expected to have a specific format as detailed in the description: \n\n- \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\"\n- \"People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\"\n- \"Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\"\n- \"General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\"\n\nThe output provided does not adhere to the required format. Instead, it separates information using dashes and does not use a comma-separated list. Additionally, it provides information that indicates \"None mentioned specifically\" for company names and \"No person names mentioned in the text\" for people names, which is not in the expected format. \n\nDue to these format violations, I conclude that the chatbot output does not comply with its description.\n\nERR"
