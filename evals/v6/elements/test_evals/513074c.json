The provided input is a string, and although it states \"Random discourse not fitting structured output,\" it is still a passage of text in the literal sense. The input does not explicitly state or imply that it defies being a text passage as per the plain reading of the specification.\n\nNo parts of the specification require the input to follow a particular structure or format beyond being a text passage, nor does it specify the need for content such as company names, names of people, or specific topics, though it allows for their inclusion. Therefore, based on direct and explicit compliance with the provided input specification, the input qualifies simply because it is a string of text and thereby forms a passage.\n\nOK",
