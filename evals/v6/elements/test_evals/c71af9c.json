  "validityText": "The given input is a string that comprises a simple sentence. To evaluate whether this input complies with the provided specification, we need to verify whether it is a passage of text. \n\nAccording to the definition of a passage, it generally refers to a portion of a written work or speech, generally at least a few sentences long, that shares a cohesive idea or information about a topic. The input here is a single short sentence.\n\nThe specification does not explicitly define what should be considered a passage of text, and a passage typically implies more than just a short sentence, potentially involving more context or elaboration.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the input does not comply with the requirement to be a 'passage of text' as it is too brief and lacks the depth typically associated with a passage. Thus, the evaluation leads to a conclusion of non-compliance.\n\nERR",
