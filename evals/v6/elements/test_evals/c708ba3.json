  "validityText": "The input provided is \"Ideas yielding tokens born pure.\" According to the input specification, the input must be a string containing a passage of text. This specification is broad, encompassing any string that could be regarded as a passage. The input in question is indeed a string of text; it might be abstract, but it remains a passage of text, making it compliant with the first rule of the specification. \n\nThe second part of the specification mentions that the text can include names of companies, names of people, specific topics, and general themes relevant to the content. The input does not explicitly contain names of companies or people, but it doesn't have to, as this is just what it \"can\" include, not what it \"must\" include. The abstract nature of this text could also relate to \"general themes,\" though it is not a requirement to match any specific theme.\n\nSince the input is a string containing a passage of text, it adheres to the input specification. There are no violations present, thus everything is in accordance with the required format.\n\nOK",
