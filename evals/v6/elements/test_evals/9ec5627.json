The input \"Unformed languish strips covering faded wisdom.\" appears to be a collection of random words or a phrase that does not convey a clear passage of text. It does not appear to align with any specific topic or theme and lacks coherence or recognizability in terms of names or subjects.\n\nExplanation:\n- The specification suggests that the input should be a passage of text. The given input is more akin to a phrase or a collection of descriptive words lacking a clear context or meaning.\n- There are no proper names (companies or people) or recognizable themes or specific topics in the input.\n- A passage generally would be more than just a single sentence or phrase and should present some level of thematic or topical content. \n\nERR",
