  "validityText": "The input provided is \"Innovations notably absent delineated specifics within text.\" According to the input specification, the input must be a string containing a passage of text. The specification allows the text to include names of companies, names of people, specific topics, and general themes relevant to the content.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. The input is a string, as it is composed of a sequence of characters. This complies with the requirement of being a passage of text.\n  \n2. The sentence \"Innovations notably absent delineated specifics within text.\" appears to be a coherent sentence, albeit somewhat abstract. It seems to suggest a theme or general observation regarding \"innovations\" and \"specifics\". While it does not mention specific companies, people, or topics, it doesn't need to under the provided specification.\n   \n3. There are no explicit instructions in the specification that require the passage to have a particular length, structure, or depth of detail, which means the abstract nature of the sentence does not inherently violate the input specification.\n\nBased on the direct compliance with the given input specification - being a passage of text that could relate to general themes - it adheres to the specification criteria.\n\nOK",
