The elements should be presented as \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\", and similar formats for people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, the chatbot output uses **bold** formatting instead of the specified format. Additionally, the placeholders \"<no_company_names>\" are used incorrectly to represent the absence of company names, instead of using an empty placeholder or a correctly formatted list. Furthermore, the separators (-||-) are used for categories where there is no content, while the general theme 'Advancements' is in italics instead of following the plain text format described. These issues indicate non-compliance with the desired format.\n\nERR"
