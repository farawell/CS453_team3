  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides the extracted elements in JSON format, listing company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, the desired format specified in the description requires a comma-separated list for each category, without using JSON format. The description specifies that the output should be in a list format as follows:\n\n- Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n- People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\n- Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_topics>\n- General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_themes>\n\nSince the format in the chatbot's output does not match the comma-separated list format as per the requirements, it does not comply with the description. Additionally, explanation provided separately is not part of the desired output format as per the description. Therefore, the output is not compliant with the provided specifications.\n\nERR"
