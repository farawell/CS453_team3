So here's what it looks like in the desired format:\n\n```json\nCompany names: \nPeople names: -||-\nSpecific topics: -||-\nGeneral themes:\n```\n\nIn this case, \"Famous individuals Selena Gomez and Elon Musk partook.\" could be considered a general theme related to celebrities or public figures who sometimes work with companies. But given the input text solely focuses on mentioning these two famous people without any company names or specific topic detail, \"Company names\" section remains empty.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output fails to adhere to the specified format. Each section (Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes) should be distinctly filled based on the entities present in the input text. Although the provided output contains placeholders, it does not comply entirely with the expectations set by the description.\n\n1. The \"Company names\" section is empty, but without knowing the text input, this cannot be completely verified.\n2. The \"People names\" section incorrectly uses the placeholder \"-||-\" which does not align with the requirements if there are any names present.\n3. The \"Specific topics\" section is also indicated with the placeholder \"-||-\", but the compliance cannot be fully evaluated without input.\n4. The \"General themes\" section is left empty instead of using the correct placeholder if applicable. \n\nMoreover, any reasoning about the content terms being absent should focus on preserving a consistent format across all sections unless specified by input constraints. Therefore, due to these format inconsistencies, the output violates the chatbot's description.\n\nERR"
