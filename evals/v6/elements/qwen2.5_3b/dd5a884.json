The \"Company names\" section is empty, which is permissible if no company names are present in the input text. However, it should be formatted similarly to the other sections, perhaps indicating \"Company names: -||-\" if no companies are mentioned, to maintain consistency in formatting.\n\n2. The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" are correctly formatted as bullet points, but they deviate from the requirement of a comma-separated list as indicated by \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" in the description. The output does not follow this guidance for lists.\n\nBased on these observations, the output does not entirely comply with the specified format, particularly with respect to consistency and list formatting.\n\nERR"
