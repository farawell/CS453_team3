  "complianceText": "The chatbot output should follow a specific format as described in the description. The provided output does not do so entirely:\n\n1. The format specified in the description was not followed. The description asks for a comma-separated list of company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, the provided output uses bullet points for \"Company names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" Moreover, the \"People names\" section is entirely missing, which is a format violation even if no people names are found.\n\n2. The section for \"People names\" is completely missing from the chatbot output. In the desired format, even if there are no names to extract, an empty entry or some indication (e.g., stating \"None\") should be provided as it forms a part of the specified structure.\n\n3. The description specifies that company names should be listed first, followed by people names, specific topics, and general themes in that order. While the order seems to have been mostly respected, the absence of the \"People names\" section breaks the defined structure and flow.\n\nBased on these issues, the output does not comply with the description provided.\n\nERR"
