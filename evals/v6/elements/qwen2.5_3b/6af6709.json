  "complianceText": "Upon evaluating the chatbot's output, we find several points of non-compliance:\n\n1. **Format of Lists**: The chatbot output partially complies with the required format:\n   - **Company names** and **People names** are correctly formatted as a comma-separated list.\n   - However, **Specific topics** and **General themes** are expected in a comma-separated list format as well, according to the description's template, but the output lists them on separate lines with bullet points.\n\n2. **Missing Content**: The section for **Specific topics** is completely empty, which suggests either a failure in extraction or presentation according to the description.\n\n3. **Order**: The order followed in the output is partially correct. It starts with company names, followed by people names, but thereâ€™s no dedicated content under Specific topics, then it moves to General themes, which misrepresents the intended structured layering.\n\nGiven these discrepancies with the specified format and order, the output does not fully comply with the description.\n\nERR"
