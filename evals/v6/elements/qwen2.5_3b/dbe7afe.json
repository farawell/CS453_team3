  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output must adhere to the specified format mentioned in the description. The required format should list company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes in a combined and concise manner, without separating them by sentences. \n\n1. **Output Format**: The output begins by segregating the extraction into different sentences, which deviates from the instruction to provide a combined format.\n\n2. **Desired Format**: Following the individual extraction for each sentence, the chatbot eventually provides a combined extraction list, but incorrectly uses '-||-' for company names only in the final output instead of each category. The correct delimiter '-||-' should be used consistently for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes, as required by the description.\n\nDue to these deviations from the required format, the output does not strictly comply with the description. \n\nERR"
