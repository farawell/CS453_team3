The format of the output generally follows the desired format outline in the chatbot description. However, the chatbot description specifies that the lists should be presented in a comma-separated format, while the output lists each item on a new line with dashes.\n\nExplanation of Violations:\n1. **Format Non-compliance**: The chatbot output uses a list format with dashes and bullet points for each item, which does not comply with the \"comma_separated_list\" requirement specified in the description for each category. The description explicitly states that the lists should be comma-separated for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes, but they are presented in a bullet list format.\n\nERR"
