According to the description, the desired format for the extracted elements must include lists of company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. These lists should all use the '<comma_separated_list>' format indicated by '-||-'. \n\nIn the provided output:\n\n- Company names: This section is empty. According to the format, it should indicate the absence of content with '-||-' if no company names are found. Without having the input, we cannot check for the correctness of content existence, so if not provided with data, it should use the correct formatting.\n  \n- People names: Properly indicated as '-||-', meaning no people names were extracted or included.\n  \n- Specific topics: Properly indicated as '-||-', meaning no specific topics were extracted or included.\n  \n- General themes: \"Innovation, Resilience\" is provided, but it does not follow the '-||-' format as required by the description. If not present, it should be noted as '-||-'.\n\nThe major issue is the formatting of company names and general themes. They should have adhered to the '-||-' format when no elements are extracted.\n\nERR"
