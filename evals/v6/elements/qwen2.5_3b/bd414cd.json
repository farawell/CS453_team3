  "complianceText": "The chatbot output first provides a list using the specified format with placeholders like \"-||-\" where there is no data extracted. This initial format complies with the required format from the description. However, the latter part of the chatbot output is inconsistent with the specified format because it introduces repetition of the information. The output needs to stick to the format restated at the beginning without reiterating the explanation about why specific elements couldn't be extracted.\n\nThus, the explanation of elements provided initially before the repeated yaml segment violates the format guideline as it does not strictly follow the structured and succinct format prescribed in the description and includes unnecessary commentary.\n\nERR"
