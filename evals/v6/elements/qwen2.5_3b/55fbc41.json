  "complianceText": "The chatbot description specifies that the output should format the extracted elements in a specific way: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes, using \"-||-\" to signify a comma-separated list for each category. \n\nReviewing the provided output: \n\n- The \"Company names\" and \"General themes\" sections follow this format correctly.\n- The \"People names\" section follows the format, using \"-||-\" but does not list any names; however, this could be appropriate if no names were present in the input as it uses the required placeholder \"-||-\".\n- The \"Specific topics\" section incorrectly lists topics as a bullet-point list instead of using the \"-||-\" format.\n\nDue to the deviation in formatting for the \"Specific topics\" section, the chatbot's output does not fully comply with the description. The description explicitly requires a \"-||-\" format for all categories without exceptions.\n\nERR"
