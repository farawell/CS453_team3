The chatbot's description specifies that the information should be presented in a specific format with comma-separated lists. While the \"Company names\" field adheres to this format by stating \"None,\" the \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\" fields deviate from this requirement by using bullet points instead of a comma-separated list. Hence, the output does not strictly comply with the format outlined in the description.\n\nERR"
