  "complianceText": "The output of the chatbot is structured into four categories: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes, which aligns with the format required by the description. However, the output style differs from the desired format specified in the description. The description specifies that each category should be represented as a comma-separated list of elements without bullet points and using the format \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" rather than the three-hash syntax used. Additionally, the output uses bullet points that are not in the desired format.\n\nBased on these observations, the output does not fully comply with the format specified in the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
