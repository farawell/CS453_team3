According to the desired format, the chatbot should extract and present the relevant information separated by a comma in each category, even if it means acknowledging the absence of entries in a concise way, as shown in the initial output list:\n\n1. **Company Names**: The output does list company names correctly by saying there are none mentioned, but it should put empty -||- in the final section.\n  \n2. **People Names**: The output mentions the name \"Steve Jobs,\" which is consistent with the requirement. But initially they said there were no people names, there is a contradiction here.\n\n3. **Specific Topics**: The output states there are no specific topics recognized, which is correctly listed in the summary, maintaining the symbol (-||-) per guidelines of format.\n\n4. **General Themes**: The explanation mentions two themes, \"Recognition and reputation,\" in the final list which was implicitly extracted from the text.\n\nThe final list of Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes should consistently adhere to the format provided. There is a contradiction between the statements and the areas to fill that are contradictory.\n\nERR"
