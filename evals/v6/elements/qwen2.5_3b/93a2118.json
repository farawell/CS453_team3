  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not strictly follow the desired format specified in the description. The expected format should list the extracted elements in separate and clearly specified sections: \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" The output uses \"None\" instead of the placeholder \"-||-\" for company names and inaccurately categorizes entities under the incorrect headings. The issue also arises from not using the exact format for outputting the specific elements as described in the desired format in the description. Therefore, the output does not comply with the description.\n\nERR"
