Extracted company names listed after \"Company names:\" in a comma-separated format.\n2. Extracted people names listed after \"People names:\" in a comma-separated format.\n3. Extracted specific topics listed after \"Specific topics:\" in a comma-separated format.\n4. Extracted general themes listed after \"General themes:\" in a comma-separated format.\n\nUpon inspection of the output:\n\n1. The \"Company names\" section is empty, but it correctly follows the given format by providing a space after the colon.\n2. The \"People names\" is not in the correct format. Instead of providing a comma-separated list after the colon, it uses \"-||-\" which does not comply with the format.\n3. The \"Specific topics\" section provides a descriptive phrase instead of a comma-separated list.\n4. The \"General themes\" section provides a list in a comma-separated format, which aligns with the expectations.\n\nBased on these observations, there is a deviation from the expected format in the \"People names\" and \"Specific topics\" sections, which is a non-compliance issue according to the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
