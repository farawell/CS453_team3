The required sections, which are \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\", are all present. However, \"Specific topics\" doesn't have the correct placeholder used in the description, which is \"-||-\". Instead, it appears as empty, similar to how \"Company names\" and \"People names\" are presented. Only the \"General themes\" section has content, and it adheres to the required format by not being empty and not using the placeholder.\n\nThe key violation here is that two sections (\"Company names\" and \"People names\") are empty without using the placeholder \"-||-\", which the description specifies should be used if there are no items to extract.\n\nERR"
