According to the guideline, company names should be separated by commas and listed on one line following the label \"Company names:\". In the output, the company name is on a separate line without a comma when there could be more than one name, as the format uses \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" to specify the required format. The other sections (\"People names\", \"Specific topics\", \"General themes\") are correctly formatted following their labels with the correct style.\n\nERR"
