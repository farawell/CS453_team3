  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is structured in the format described in the guidelines, listing company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, there is non-compliance in mentioning \"None\" for company names, people names, and specific topics directly in the bold list, while the guidelines suggest a comma-separated list, which implies listing items directly when there are any, rather than stating \"None.\" Additionally, the general themes section includes extra explanatory text about the absence of specific elements, which goes beyond the simple theme identification specified in the desired format. Therefore, while the basic headings are present, the extra text for general themes and the use of \"None\" indicates non-compliance with the precise output format described in the guidelines.\n\nERR"
