According to the desired format, the output for \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes\" should have been in a comma-separated list, not a multi-line list. The list of \"People names\" is missing a comma-separated list even though 'Alice Waters' is mentioned separately as a person's name. This violates the description's instruction for strict formatting: \"People names: -||-\" This applies to \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" as well.\n\nERR"
