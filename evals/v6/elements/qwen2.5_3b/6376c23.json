  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description provided. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Company names** and **People names** sections have been incorrectly filled with incorrect categories. 'Mark Zuckerberg' and 'Jack Dorsey' are people names but are listed under 'Company names', while 'Facebook' and 'Twitter' are company names but are listed under 'People names'. The chatbot description specifies distinct and accurate lists for company and people names.\n\n2. The format for listing entities is not strictly followed. The desired format specified involves using comma-separated lists for each category, whereas the output uses bullet points.\n\nThese issues demonstrate non-compliance with the structured output required by the description.\n\nERR"
