  "complianceText": "The chatbot output should follow a specific format as detailed in the description. The required format uses comma-separated lists immediately after each category label (e.g., \"Company names:\", \"People names:\", etc.), without any additional separators such as \"<sep>\". In this case, the chatbot output used \"<sep>\" after \"Company names\" and \"Specific topics\", which deviates from the specified desired format.\n\nAdditionally, \"People names\" and \"Specific topics\" are shown as '-||-' in the description. While the chatbot correctly uses this for \"People names\", it incorrectly uses \"<sep>\" for \"Specific topics\".\n\nTherefore, the output does not fully comply with the chatbot's description.\n\nERR"
