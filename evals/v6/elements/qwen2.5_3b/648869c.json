The format specified in the description indicates that extracted elements should be presented as comma-separated lists for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. While the output does follow this format for themes, it does not provide comma-separated lists for the other categories but simply leaves them blank, followed by explanations.\n\nAdditionally, the output includes extra information about the absence of specific company names and people names not asked for in the description, which can be considered unnecessary and deviates from the required format.\n\nERR"
