  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot's output is as follows:\n\n1. **Format Compliance**:\n   - The chatbot output deviates from the desired format specified in the description. The output uses a markdown style, listing items with a dash and space character (\"- \"), whereas the description requires a comma-separated list for each category. \n   - Specifically, the description specifies the output should be formatted with comma-separated lists like:\n     ```\n     Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n     People names: -||-\n     Specific topics: -||-\n     General themes: -||-\n     ```\n   - The output provided uses a vertical list with bullet points instead, which does not comply with the format instruction to list items separated by commas.\n\n2. **Extraction Category Separation**:\n   - The sections for \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes\" are mentioned, which aligns with the categories specified in the description. \n\n3. **Verification of Content**:\n   - Verification of the content itself (correctness) is not evaluated as it requires knowledge of the original input text. This evaluation only checks whether format and structure comply with the given description.\n\nOverall, due to the incorrect use of formatting styles that deviate from comma-separated lists, the output format does not fulfill the description requirements.\n\nERR"
