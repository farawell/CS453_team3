According to the description, the chatbot is expected to list out company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. They must be formatted in a comma-separated list specifically under each heading. \n\nIn the output provided:\n- The \"Company names\" section is left blank without using the placeholder (\"-||-\") as intended for sections with no entries.\n- The \"People names\" section properly uses the placeholder (\"-||-\") which indicates no entries, aligning with the requirements.\n- The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections appear to be formatted correctly as per the description, listing items as comma-separated values under the appropriate headings.\n\nThe specific issue identified is the improper handling of an empty list for \"Company names,\" which does not have an entry and also lacks the \"-||-\" placeholder.\n\nERR"
