  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides results in the specified format, with sections for company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, there is a clear violation in the output for the \"Specific topics\" section. The description requires extracting specific topics fitting the content and providing them in the format \"Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\", not using the \"-||-\" placeholder. This format appears to act as a placeholder for 'none' or similar, which is not part of the described format in the task; it should always be an explicit list as indicatedâ€”even if empty, which it isn't specified it can be. Similarly, the company names and people names sections should have hyphens between the placeholders if they intended 'none' such as \"-||-\", but this is not clearly indicated in the execution.\n\nERR"
