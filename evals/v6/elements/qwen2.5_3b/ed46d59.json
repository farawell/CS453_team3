  "complianceText": "The output format provided by the chatbot does not comply with the chatbot description. According to the description, the desired format specifies that the output should be a comma-separated list for each category, not bullet points:\n\n- Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n- People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\n- Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\n- General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n\nHowever, the chatbot uses bullet points instead of a comma-separated list. This is a clear violation of the format specified in the description. Also, the lists for Company names and People names should be explicitly labeled as \"None\" in a comma-separated list format, rather than written as a subtitle with a bullet list type (\"- None\"). \n\nERR"
