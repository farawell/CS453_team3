  "output": "Based on the provided text, here is the structured output in the desired format:\n\n```\nCompany names: Y Combinator, Techstars\n\nPeople names: -||-\n\nSpecific topics:\n- Jessica Livingston (speaker)\n- Entrepreneurship\n- Venture capital\n- Startups\n- Startup panel\n\nGeneral themes:\n- Startup ecosystem\n```",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output partly follows the prescribed format but not entirely. Here is the evaluation:\n\n1. **Company names**: The chatbot correctly lists company names, with two companies correctly separated by commas.\n\n2. **People names**: The chatbot uses '-||-' as desired when there are no people names to list. However, there is a violation here because \"Jessica Livingston\" is mentioned under specific topics with an indication that she is a speaker, implying it should be listed under People names if it fits the intended listing category. Without the input, it's not possible to assess if Jessica Livingston should be there, assume it should be given such indications.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The specific topics are listed with markdown bullet points, which violates the required format of having a comma-separated list. Additionally, using \"-||-\" is not followed when specific topics are listed which also shows non-compliance if specific topics were there, it should be a comma-separated list according to the desired format.\n\n4. **General themes**: The general themes section correctly uses the desired format of a comma-separated list for listing multiple themes. But since it only lists one theme, the use of bullet point is not justified as the required format does not advocate for bullet points.\n\nIn summary, the output violates the format rules for \"People names,\" \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\". \"Specific topics\" should be in a comma-separated list format. Also, \"People names\" section is potentially incomplete or incorrectly formatted, considering the inclusion of \"Jessica Livingston\" as a speaker under \"Specific topics.\"\n\nERR"
