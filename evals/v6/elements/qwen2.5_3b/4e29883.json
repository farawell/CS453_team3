This indicates that the text did not contain recognizable entities for these categories. The output format provided at the end is consistent with the \"Desired format\" mentioned in the chatbot's description. The description specifies that each category should be followed by a comma-separated list of names or topics; if none, as here, it is appropriate to leave the fields empty.
