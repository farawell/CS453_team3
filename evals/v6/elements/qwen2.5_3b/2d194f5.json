The output lists \"Adaptation in Business, Resilience in Business\" as specific topics, which adheres to that part of the desired format. However, the output uses \"-||-\" to indicate sections where there are no elements to extract, which is fine if there's nothing to list, but it doesn't clarify if that was due to lack of content in the input text or oversight. Since compliance requires no assumptions and the section for company names is left empty, not matching the format of a list (even if it's empty, should have said '-||-' like the others), this indicates a lack of compliance with the stated desired format in the description.\n\nERR"
