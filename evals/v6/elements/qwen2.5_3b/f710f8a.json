However, it does not fully comply with the specified format. The expected structure is:\n\n- Company Names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n- People Names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\n- Specific Topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\n- General Themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\n\nThe chatbot's output uses bullet points and does not provide a comma-separated list as required. Additionally, the categories \"Formula 1\" and \"NASCAR\" as company names should be evaluated based on given input text, and since the input isn't available, this can't be ascertained as correct or incorrectâ€”yet the structural output format is non-compliant.\n\nERR"
