Next, it lists \"People names\" followed by a single name, also adhering to the comma-separated list format. The section \"Specific topics\" is presented, aligning with the expected format. However, in the \"General themes\" section, the chatbot uses \"-||-\" instead of providing actual content, which is not compliant as it is supposed to list general overarching themes rather than repeating \"-||-\". \n\nERR"
