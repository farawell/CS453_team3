The format described in the chatbot's description requires all sections to be present and properly populated with a comma-separated list of items if applicable. Specifically, there are some issues with the output:\n\n1. No company names provided: The \"Company names\" section is empty, whereas it should contain a list even if it is simply denoted with \"-||-\" to show there are no names to extract.\n\n2. The format should be consistent throughout, using \"-||-\" only when there are no items to list. However, an adherence to the format for listing companies by denoting it properly, even when none are present, is missing.\n\nThese elements demonstrate non-compliance with the expected output format as per the description.\n\nERR"
