The output should have a section for \"People names,\" but this section is missing. Moreover, the lists (e.g., Company names, Specific topics) must be in a comma-separated format, and the provided format uses hyphenated list items instead. \n\nFurthermore, the sections should appear in a specific order: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. Without knowing the input text, it's impossible to determine whether the extracted entities and themes are correct; however, the format requirements and structure are clear violations.\n\nERR"
