  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not fully comply with the desired format described in the prompt. According to the description, four elements need to be extracted and formatted specifically: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. \n\n1. Company names: This field is present, but it is left empty rather than containing a comma-separated list or \"None\" if there truly were no company names to extract. Without knowing the input, we cannot verify correctness but can verify format compliance, which is not met.\n   \n2. People names: This field is present and correctly formatted with '-||-', indicating no names were extracted. This matches the expected output in cases where no relevant entities are found.\n\n3. Specific topics: This field is also present and correctly formatted with '-||-', indicating no topics were extracted. Again, formatting is consistent with expectations if no topics are present in the text.\n\n4. General themes: A description is provided, integrating themes extracted from the text, but it does not follow a specific structure like the company names, missing the possible \"None\" or list format. The accuracy of themes cannot be judged without input, but format compliance is noted.\n\nThe primary issue is with the Company names section being left blank instead of showing a clear indication like \"None\" or related formatting. There's also a potential non-compliance in general themes since it adds descriptive detail when formatting was expected to be consistent.\n\nERR"
