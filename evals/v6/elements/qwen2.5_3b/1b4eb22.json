  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not fully comply with the description provided. According to the description, the required format for output is:\n\n- Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\n- People names: -||-\n- Specific topics: -||-\n- General themes: -||-\n\nThe output provided by the chatbot partially complies with this format. There are several issues:\n\n1. **People names**: The output lists 'People names:' but provides a dash '-' instead of a comma-separated list. The expected output should show '-||-' if there are no names mentioned. \n\n2. **Specific topics**: The section for 'Specific topics' is missing any listed topics and is left blank. According to the desired format, it should show '-||-' if there is nothing to list.\n\n3. **General themes**: The section was populated with themes. However, since compliance does not regard checking correctness, and given that placeholders such as '-||-' are not provided for the empty sections, it is a format violation.\n\nGiven these violations, the chatbot's output does not completely comply with the template prescribed by the description.\n\nERR"
