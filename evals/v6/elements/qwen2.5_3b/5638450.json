  "output": "Company names: SpaceX, Boeing\nPeople names: John Doe, Jane Smith\nSpecific topics: -||-\nGeneral themes:\n- Space exploration  \n- Technological innovation  \n- Outer space research  \n\nNote: There was no overarching or primary theme presented in the text provided that could be distinguished as a single, general theme. Thus, the provided specific topic and its associated details are given priority over a more generalized theme which would fit both texts equally.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output presents the extracted elements in the specified format to a certain extent, but there are some inconsistencies with the description:\n\n1. **Company names**: The output correctly lists company names in the desired comma-separated format.\n\n2. **People names**: The output correctly lists people names in the desired comma-separated format.\n\n3. **Specific topics**: The output uses \"-||-\" as a placeholder, which could signify there's no specific topic, but it is unclear if this is intentional or an error, as there are specific topics listed under general themes. \n\n4. **General themes**: While the themes are listed correctly, the note at the end indicates a deviation from the expected output format. The presence of such a note is not mentioned in the desired format. The note explains the absence of a single overarching general theme, which might be considered helpful but is not in line with the specified format. The general themes section should not include this additional commentary.\n\nGiven the explicit format described in the task's instructions, the presence of the note and the '-||-' placeholder in specific topics when themes were defined lead to non-compliance with the output format requirements.\n\nERR"
