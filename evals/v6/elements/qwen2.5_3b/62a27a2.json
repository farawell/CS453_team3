  "complianceText": "The evaluation process involves checking whether the output aligns with the desired format outlined in the chatbot's description. The chatbot's output is evaluated as follows:\n\n1. **Company names**: The format is correct, and two entities are listed separated by a comma.\n2. **People names**: The placeholder \"-||-\" is used correctly, indicating no people names were extracted.\n3. **Specific topics**: Two specific topics are listed. They are not in a comma-separated format, but instead in a list format. However, the description does not specify any particular format for this section, so this is acceptable.\n4. **General themes**: One overarching theme is listed. Similarly to the specific topics section, the format is not specified beyond listing the themes, which the output does.\n\nThe output adheres to the expected structure and uses the specified placeholders where no elements are present, hence showing compliance with the description's format requirements.\n\nOK"
