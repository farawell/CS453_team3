Each of these categories should be presented with a comma-separated list denoted within square brackets `[ ]`, adhering to JSON format.\n\nIn this output:\n- \"Company names\" is presented correctly as an empty list `[]`.\n- \"People names\" uses `-||-`, which does not comply with the JSON list format expected. It should also be `[]` if empty.\n\nThe following points also concern compliance:\n- \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" do use list brackets, but the content of the lists without knowledge of the input cannot be validated.\n  \nThe non-compliance in this output primarily originates from the improper formatting of \"People names\", which should adhere to the JSON structure even if it is empty. Thus, regardless of the specific topics and themes content accuracy, the format itself is not correctly followed, leading to an evaluation of non-compliance.\n\nERR"
