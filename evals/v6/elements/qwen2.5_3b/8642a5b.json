However, the output does not provide the extracted elements in the desired format. Each category should be followed by a \"<comma_separated_list_of_entities>\" or \"-||-\" (for empty lists according to the format). Instead, the results are directly followed by an explanatory sentence, which does not conform with the given format. Moreover, the extracted elements should be explicitly listed following each category even if they are empty, using \"-||-\" for representation, which is not present in the output. Hence, the output violates the description's formatting requirements. \n\nERR"
