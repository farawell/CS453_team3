The output must be an array.  
The array must contain strings representing model names extracted from the machine learning paper abstract.  
If there are model names found, each model name must be a string element within the array.  
If no model names are found or if it is not clear if there are model names, the array must contain the single string "NA".  
The array must be formatted with double quotes around each element.  
The response must be in a standardized format regardless of the content of the abstract provided.  
The array must always be returned as the output even if no valid model names are found.
