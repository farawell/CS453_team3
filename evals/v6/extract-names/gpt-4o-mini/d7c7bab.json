  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is `[\"SVM-Custom\"]`, which is in the format describedâ€”an array of model names. According to the guidelines provided, the format `[\\\"model_name\\\"]` is satisfied. The guidelines also state that if model names are not found or are uncertain, the response should be `[\"NA\"]`. Without knowing the input, we cannot determine with certainty if \"SVM-Custom\" is correctly identified as a model name from the abstract. Therefore, based on direct compliance with the format rules alone and not knowing the input, the output is compliant with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
