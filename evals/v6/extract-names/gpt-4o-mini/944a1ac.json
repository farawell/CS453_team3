It presents two model names: \"CNN-Optimizer\" and \"Standard CNN.\" Since the description requires an array of model names if any are found, and the output presents such an array, it seems to comply with the requirement. I'm not in a position to confirm the correctness of these model names, as it requires knowledge of the input abstract, but the compliance in terms of format is correct.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
