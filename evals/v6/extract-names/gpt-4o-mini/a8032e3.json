  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot is in the format of an array containing a model name, [\"RL-ProMax\"], which adheres to the requirement of outputting model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. Although the description mentions returning [\"NA\"] if no model names are found or if the chatbot is unsure, this check cannot be performed without knowing the input. Therefore, it is not possible to evaluate compliance based on that criterion. The format requirement is met, and no other rules can be evaluated without the input, so the output is compliant as per the guidelines provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
