According to the description, if no model names are found in the abstract, the chatbot should return [\"NA\"]. Without knowing the input, we cannot judge whether this output is correct based on the abstract content. However, the output format complies with the described behaviorâ€”returning [\"NA\"] when model names are not extracted or identified.\n\nOK"
