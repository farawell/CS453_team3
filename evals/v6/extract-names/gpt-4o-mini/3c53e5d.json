The format of the output is consistent with the expected array format described in the chatbot's description, which is [\"model_name\"]. Since the input is not provided, I cannot determine whether \"Inception-V4\" is actually a model name from the given abstract. However, the output format aligns with what's required by the description: an array of model names.\n\nOK"
