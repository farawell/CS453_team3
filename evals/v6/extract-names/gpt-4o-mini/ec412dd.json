Since we do not have the input abstract, we cannot evaluate the correctness of the extracted model name but only the compliance with the structure and format expectations set out in the description. The format [\"model_name\"] is respected here. As there is no specific rule violated within the provided guidelines, and it's compliant with expected output structure when a model name is found.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
