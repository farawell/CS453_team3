  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is an array containing a single model name \"SVR-Hybrid\". This format complies with the chatbot description that requires the output to be an array of model names. There is no requirement to know the input abstract for this compliance check, as the format itself is correct. The guidelines specified that, if model names are identified, they are to be returned in the format [\"model_name\"], and the output complies with this format. Since there is no concrete indication of non-compliance in the output format itself, I conclude that it complies with the guidelines specified in the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
