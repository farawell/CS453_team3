This format complies with the output requirement of an array of model names as specified in the description. Without knowing the input, we cannot determine the correctness of the model name itself, so we focus solely on the compliance in terms of format and structure as outlined in the task description. The output matches the expected structure of [\"model_name\"], where \"TrendNet\" is a placeholder for the actual model name, assuming it's correctly extracted from the given abstract.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
