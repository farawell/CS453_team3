  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is an array containing the model name [\"Q-Learn++\"]. The description specifies that the output must be an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. This requirement is directly met, as the output is indeed an array of strings. Additionally, since the rule stating that if no model names are found, it should return [\"NA\"], depends on the content of the input, which is not provided, it is not evaluated here. Therefore, based on the provided guidelines and the description, there are no detectable violations in the output. \n\nOK"
