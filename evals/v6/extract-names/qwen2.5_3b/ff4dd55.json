The output format specifies that the response should be an array following this pattern: [\"model_name\"]. In this case, [\"QuantumAI\"] fits the expected format, regardless of whether the actual input abstract has this or any model name or not. This judgment purely rests on format compliance as we are not given the input to determine correctness.\n\nOK"
