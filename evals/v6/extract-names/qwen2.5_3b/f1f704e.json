The format is also correct as it uses square brackets and includes the model name in quotes as specified in the task description. Since the input is unknown, compliance with rules that depend on input content cannot be evaluated. Based on the provided output format and structure, the chatbot has complied with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
