This format aligns with the required format of [\"model_name\"] as outlined in the chatbot's description. The description states that if no model names are found or if there is uncertainty, the output should be [\"NA\"]. Since there is a model name provided, the expectation based on the rules is satisfied â€” assuming this is extracted correctly from the input abstract which we do not have.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
