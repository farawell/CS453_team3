There is no indication that it should have been \"NA\" since we are not given the input and hence cannot determine whether there were any model names in the abstract. Since the guidelines tell us to ignore anything which requires knowing the input, the output format of [\"ResNet\"] complies with the description as it is in the correct format.\n\nOK"
