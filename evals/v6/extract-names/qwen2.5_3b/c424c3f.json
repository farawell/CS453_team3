  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is [[\"ResNet-Extra\"]], which is an array containing a model name. This output seems to be compliant with the directive to extract model names from machine learning paper abstracts. Furthermore, the output format is consistent with the requirement: an array of the model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. \n\nAccording to the description, if a model name is found, it should be output in this array format. If none is found or the chatbot is unsure, it should return [\"NA\"]. Since the output specifies a particular model name within the correct format, it complies with the description without knowing if the input indeed contains \"ResNet-Extra\".\n\nOK"
