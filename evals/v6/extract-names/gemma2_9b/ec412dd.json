The description specifies that the response should be an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"], and this condition is met by the output. Since no input is given, I cannot verify if the model name mentioned is correct or not, and it is not a requirement to ensure correctness without the input. Therefore, based on the compliance with the format guideline, the output is acceptable.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
