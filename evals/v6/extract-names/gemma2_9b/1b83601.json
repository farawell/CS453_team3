According to the description, the output should be in the format `[\"model_name\"]` if a model name is detected, which matches the given output, `[\"Transformer XL\"]`. There is no indication or evidence in the output itself that suggests a non-compliance, and since we don't have the input, we can't verify if the model name is correct but this is not a concern as per the guidelines since correctness requires knowing the input.\n\nOK"
