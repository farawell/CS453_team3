  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is an array containing what appears to be a model name \"SVM-Custom\". This complies with the description requirement to return an array of model names. The format provided of the output `[\"model_name\"]` is adhered to as \"SVM-Custom\" is within an array. There is no indication from this output that it violates any stipulations mentioned regarding the format and structure of the response. Furthermore, since I am not provided with the input, I cannot evaluate whether the model name extraction is correct but that is not required here. Hence, the output complies with all the rules that do not require the input for validation. My decision is based on evaluating compliance with the specified format as per the description.\n\nOK"
