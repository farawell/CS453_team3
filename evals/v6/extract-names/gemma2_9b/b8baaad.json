This complies with the description which specifies that the response should be an array of model names or [\"NA\"] if none are found or if unsure. Since we don't have the input to verify whether model names were present in the abstract, we cannot judge the correctness of the responseâ€”only format compliance.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
