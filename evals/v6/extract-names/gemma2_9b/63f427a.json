  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is in the format of an array with a single model name \"Transformer\" enclosed within it. According to the description, the output format should be an array of model names, and this output aligns with that requirement. Moreover, since we don't have the abstract input to verify if \"Transformer\" is actually mentioned or not, we can't determine if the name extracted is correct. However, the format requirement is satisfied, and inspecting correctness beyond the format requires knowledge of the input, which has been excluded from the evaluation process.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
