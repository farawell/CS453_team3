The given output is an array containing a single string, which matches the prescribed format for an array of model names. There is no indication of multiple models which require concatenation, nor is there a failure to enclose the model name in quotes or the array in square brackets. \n\nSince we cannot check whether \"Inception-V3\" is actually a model name from the abstract without being given the abstract itself, we focus solely on the compliance of the output format with the description. The output adheres to the rules by providing a model name in the correct format.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
