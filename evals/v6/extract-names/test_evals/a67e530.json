  "coverage": "[\"IntegralNN\"]",
  "validityText": "The input abstract mentions \"IntegralNN,\" which appears to be a specific model name. The description is consistent with the input specification as it includes a sentence about a model used in machine learning research. It uses terms related to machine learning like \"neural network components\" and \"predictive performance,\" which are technical terms relevant to the field. The content does not include non-textual elements such as tables or figures descriptions. Hence, the input text seems to comply with the input specification.\n\nOK",
