  "validityText": "The input provided is a text section from a machine learning paper abstract. It contains a sentence that describes a model known as \"ResNet-Extra,\" which is a variant of the residual network aimed at reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy. This description aligns with the input specification, as it includes sentences and a phrase describing a model (ResNet-Extra) used in machine learning research. The input also uses technical terms relevant to the field, such as \"residual network\" and \"computational costs.\" There are no non-textual elements like tables or figures present in the input. Therefore, the input complies with the input specification.\n\nOK",
