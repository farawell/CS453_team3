  "validityText": "The input is an abstract section from a paper. It describes a system called CaptionGen and mentions that it generates image captions using novel deep learning techniques. This fits within the requirement of describing models, methods, or techniques used in machine learning research. The mention of \"novel deep learning techniques\" aligns with the specification that allows for technical terms and specific model names relevant to machine learning. The abstract does not include any non-textual elements such as table or figure descriptions, complying with the requirement as well.\n\nOK",
