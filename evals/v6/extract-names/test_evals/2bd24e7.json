  "coverage": "Output:\n[\"ZoomNet\", \"FastRCNN\"]",
  "validityText": "The input begins with a phrase indicating it is an abstract, which aligns with the context of being a section extracted from a machine learning paper abstract. The text explicitly mentions \"machine learning models\" and lists specific model names, \"ZoomNet\" and \"FastRCNN.\" These are both consistent with the requirement for including sentences and phrases that describe models, methods, or techniques used in machine learning research. Additionally, technical terms like \"experiments\" and \"conventional methods\" are present, further indicating the text pertains to machine learning. The input also does not contain any non-textual elements, such as tables or figures descriptions, complying with the requirement for textual content only. Based on these observations, the input adheres to the input specification.\n\nOK",
  "validity": "ok"
