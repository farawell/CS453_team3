  "validityText": "The input provided is a text section extracted from a machine learning paper abstract. It includes a sentence that describes a model used in machine learning research—specifically, an \"RNN-Boosted model\"—and mentions its application to speech recognition, which is a common domain in machine learning. The sentence also refers to the performance of the model by indicating a \"significant decrease in error rates.\" This kind of information aligns well with the requirement that the input should describe models, methods, or techniques used in machine learning research. The input specification allows for the inclusion of model names and technical terms, which are present here.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
