  "validityText": "The input “ViT was a breakthrough, contributing immensely to transformer-based methods.” contains a sentence extracted from a machine learning paper abstract that describes a model (ViT, which stands for Vision Transformer) and mentions its contribution to transformer-based methods. This aligns with the specification that the input should describe models, methods, or techniques used in machine learning research. It also includes technical terms and specific model names relevant to machine learning (in this case, ViT and transformer-based methods), which are explicitly allowed by the input specification. Additionally, the input is purely textual without any mention of figures or tables. Based on the input specification, the input meets all the given criteria for compliance.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
