  "validityText": "The given input is a text section extracted from a machine learning paper abstract. It describes a model, MarkovModel-V2, which is used for improved risk assessment in financial predictive modeling. This aligns with the input specification that expects content related to models, methods, or techniques used in machine learning research. The input includes a specific model name relevant to machine learning, which complies with the requirement that the input can include technical terms, acronyms, and specific model names. There is no mention of non-textual elements such as tables or figures descriptions, hence it does not violate any part of the specification.\n\nOK",
