  "validityText": "The given input is an abstract from a machine learning paper that describes a model used in the research. It mentions a specific model name, \"ConvoNet-X,\" which is a convolutional model. The text also briefly describes the context in which the model is used, namely image classification tasks. There are no non-textual elements like tables or figures mentioned, and the content is enough to potentially include model names and descriptions of methods used in machine learning research. Therefore, the input complies with the input specification provided.\n\nOK",
