  "validityText": "The given input is a text section that mentions deep learning models, specifically \"ResNet\" and \"VGG,\" which are widely recognized and used in machine learning research, particularly in image classification tasks. The input clearly refers to models used in machine learning, which aligns with the input specification's requirement for text to describe models, methods, or techniques in machine learning. Additionally, the input includes technical terms like \"deep learning\" and mentions specific model names relevant to machine learning. There is no mention of non-textual elements, such as tables or figure descriptions.\n\nOK",
