It describes a specific model, \"SVM-Custom\", which is a tailored support vector machine, thus incorporating technical terms and specific model names relevant to machine learning. The abstract does not include any non-textual elements, such as tables or figures' descriptions. The content is sufficient to include description of the model used, which complies with the input specification stating that the input should describe models, methods, or techniques used in machine learning research.\n\nOK",
