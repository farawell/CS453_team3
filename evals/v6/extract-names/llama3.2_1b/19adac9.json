However, \"Traditional Methods\" does not appear to be a specific model name, as it seems more like a category of techniques rather than a distinct model name. The output should contain specific model names, and if unsure or no model names are found, it should return [\"NA\"]. Therefore, the output does not comply with the description because \"Traditional Methods\" doesn't seem to be a model name.\n\nERR"
