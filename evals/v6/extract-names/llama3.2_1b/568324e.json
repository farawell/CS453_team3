The description specifies that if no model names are found, or if the chatbot is unsure, it should return [\"NA\"]. The chatbot output used \"[N/A]\", with forward slashes and incorrect capitalization. The expected format is a lowercase \"NA\" without a slash, in double quotes within an array. This discrepancy in format results in non-compliance with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
