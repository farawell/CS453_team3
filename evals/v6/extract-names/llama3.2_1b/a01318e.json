According to the description, the task is to extract model names from machine learning paper abstracts and return them in an array. If there is a model name, it should be listed only once, regardless of how many times it appears in the abstract. In this case, the chatbot output includes the model name \"CaptionGen\" twice in the array. This repetition violates the directive, as the array should list unique model names extracted from the abstract.\n\nERR"
