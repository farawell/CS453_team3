If no model names are found or the chatbot is uncertain, it should return [\"NA\"]. \n\nFor the given output, [\"Lenet\"], the format is correct as it is an array containing a model name. Without the input, I cannot verify if \"Lenet\" is indeed a model name mentioned in the abstract, but the format conforms to the specification. No rule is violated in the provided output based on the format requirement.\n\nOK"
