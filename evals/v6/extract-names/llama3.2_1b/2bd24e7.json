  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is an array with two model names [\"ZoomNet\", \"FastRCNN\"], which is consistent with the format specified in the description [\"model_name\"]. The output aligns with the requirement to provide an array of model names extracted from a machine learning paper abstract. The description doesn't specify a limit on the number of model names that can be returned, so having multiple names in the output is compliant. There is no indication of any non-compliance based on the description and the output provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
