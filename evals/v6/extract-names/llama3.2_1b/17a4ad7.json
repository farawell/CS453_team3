  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides the note: \"There are no explicit model names mentioned in the abstract\" and then returns [\"NA\"]. The description specifies that if no model names are found or if the chatbot is unsure, it should return [\"NA\"]. The note confirming the absence of explicit model names aligns with this requirement. There is no violation related to the format since the response correctly follows the required structure by returning [\"NA\"] when no model names are identified or when unsure. Therefore, the output accurately adheres to the direct compliance guidelines provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
