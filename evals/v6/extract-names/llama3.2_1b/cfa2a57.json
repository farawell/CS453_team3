According to the description, the output should be a single array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. This means that all extracted model names should be combined into one array, rather than presented in separate arrays. The presence of two distinct arrays violates the format guideline specified in the description. Therefore, this output does not comply with the description provided.\n\nERR"
