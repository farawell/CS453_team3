The output is in the format [\"NA\"], which is specified in the description for cases where no model names are found in the abstract or if the chatbot is unsure. Although the output includes an additional explanatory sentence, it does not violate the requirement as it does not disrupt the required format, which is the array [\"NA\"]. The key aspect here is maintaining the format [\"NA\"], which the output correctly does.\n\nOK"
