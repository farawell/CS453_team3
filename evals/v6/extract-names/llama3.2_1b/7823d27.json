  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot is `## [\"Trees- SuperCluster\"]`. The chatbot description requires the output to be an array of model names in the format `[\"model_name\"]`, and if no model name is mentioned or if it's unclear, to return `[\"NA\"]`. However, the output includes a statement following the model name, \"because the abstracts do not mention model names. I will return [\"NA\"].\" This statement is unnecessary and not part of the required output format. \n\nAccording to the description, the output should strictly be an array. Since the output includes additional commentary, it does not comply with the description's requirement to output solely an array of model names, if such names exist, or [\"NA\"] otherwise.\n\nERR"
