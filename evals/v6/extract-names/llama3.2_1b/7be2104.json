  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is a code snippet defining a function `extract_model_names` that processes a list of abstracts and determines model names based on certain conditions. However, this approach does not directly comply with the description provided:\n\n1. The description expects an array format of `[\"model_name\"]` as the direct output for each abstract. The code, on the other hand, processes a list of abstracts and appends results to `model_names`, which is then returned. This is misaligned with the expected output structure.\n\n2. The function uses specific conditions `\"boosting\"` and `\"graph-based\"` to determine when to return `[\"NA\"]`, which is not mentioned in the description.\n\n3. The expected output for each abstract should not reference the input text explicitly unless directly tied to a model name. This is not addressed in the code logic since it just appends abstracts that don't meet specific conditions.\n\n4. The code snippet implies a method rather than an actual single response, which contradicts the direct response format required by the task description.\n\nDue to these points, the output does not comply with the task description.\n\nERR"
