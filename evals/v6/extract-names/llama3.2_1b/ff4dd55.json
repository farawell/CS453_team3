  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output presents two instances of \"[NA]\", which indicates that it did not find or was not sure about any model names in the abstract. According to the description, it is acceptable for the chatbot to return \"[\\\"NA\\\"]\" when it doesn't find model names or is uncertain. However, the key issue here is that the chatbot duplicated the \"[NA]\" output, suggesting it found more than one result of being uncertain or not finding model names. \n\nThe description specifically states that you should return an array in the format [\"model_name\"] or [\"NA\"], which implies a single output rather than multiple instances. This duplication of \"[NA]\" in the output does not comply with the instruction to provide a singular response when uncertain.\n\nERR"
