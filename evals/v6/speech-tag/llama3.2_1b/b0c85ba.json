  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains multiple part-of-speech tags: \"CC,\" \"JJ,\" \"Unknown,\" and \"CantAnswer.\" Each output is repeated or presented in the form \"Tag: Tag.\" According to the task description, the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag without duplication or using the format \"Tag: Tag.\" Additionally, it should return just one part-of-speech tag relevant to the given input or use \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if the word cannot be tagged. Given the format \"Tag: Tag,\" it suggests a formatting issue since the output should not repeat this way. The outputs don't adhere to the expected singular form and are not compliant as per the evaluation guidelines mentioned.\n\nERR"
