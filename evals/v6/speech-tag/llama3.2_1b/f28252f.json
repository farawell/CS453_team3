  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot contains part of speech tags that are claimed to correspond to given words in sentences. According to the description, the chatbot should provide just the part of speech tag for each given word in a sentence. Let's evaluate the compliance of this output with the guidelines:\n\n1. **CC: Coordinating conjunction** - This line only contains a tag and no word or sentence is displayed. Without knowing if it is correct, this line itself is compliant as it only presents the part of speech tag.\n\n2. **sentence: I'll see you on word: I'll WP$: Possessive wh-pronoun** - The output shows parts of a sentence and indicates that \"I'll\" is a word in the sentence. It shows a tag \"WP$: Possessive wh-pronoun\" which is indeed a part of speech tag from the provided list, so the output format is compliant as it contains only the tag.\n\n3. **sentence: us, on word: you PDT: Predeterminer** - Similarly, it highlights \"you\" as a word in the sentence and provides a tag \"PDT: Predeterminer\" from the provided list. Format is compliant as it contains only the tag.\n\n4. **sentence: I'll see, on word: I'll, us, on** - This part does not include a part of speech tag as described. It presents words instead of the required tag. This is non-compliant because it does not provide a tag at all.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, not all parts of the output adhere to the task description, as the last part does not comply with the requirement to return only the part of speech tag.\n\nERR"
