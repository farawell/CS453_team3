  "complianceText": "The chatbot output appears to provide two tags for the word \"that\": \"CC\" and \"Unknown: WW\". As per the task description, the expected output should only contain a single part of speech tag from the given list. The presence of \"Unknown: WW\" seems to introduce a tag that is not listed in the official tags provided in the description. This violates the guideline that only specified part of speech tags should be used, and if the word cannot be tagged appropriately, only \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" can be returned. The tag \"WW\" is not included in the list, and hence this part of the output does not comply with the task description.\n\nERR"
