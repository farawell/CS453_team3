  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is meant to provide the part of speech tags for given words. However, the output given here includes two part of speech tags (\"CC\" and \"NN\") along with words that might be original input parts, \"Sentence\" and \"dollars.\" According to the description, the chatbot should return either one singular part of speech tag, \"Unknown,\" or \"CantAnswer.\" The output consists of two tags corresponding to two words, which suggests the output was for multiple words which violates the rule of returning one tag per prompt. Therefore, the output does not comply with the given description as it produces two tags instead of the expected single tag.\n\nERR"
