The task specifies that only the part of speech tag should be returned, yet the output includes much more information than just the tag. There are complete sentences and definitions provided, which do not comply with the instruction to only return the tag.\n2. The output includes tags not defined in the task description, such as \"SD: Subordinating conjunction\". There is no mention of the tag \"SD\" in the list of acceptable tags.\n3. The output format is incorrect as it provides additional explanations and the incorrect classification of the word.\n4. Additionally, there is no isolation of a singular output for the word; instead, there is an attempted list-like structure with various incomplete pieces of speech tagging, which violates the direction to only provide the part of speech tag for the given word.\n\nERR"
