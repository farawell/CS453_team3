In the provided output, multiple tags are listed before the actual evaluation of \"Scoot\" and \"Over\". This inclusion of \"CC: CD:\" is not in compliance with the requirement for a singular part of speech tag. Instead, at most, there should be one tag for each analyzed word, or 'Unknown'/'CantAnswer' if appropriate. Therefore, the output does not adhere to the requirement of returning just the tag.\n\nERR"
