  "complianceText": "The given chatbot output lists three tags: \"1. DD: Determiner\", \"2. WC: Wh-Adverb\", and \"3. NN: Noun\". According to the description, it should only return one part-of-speech tag. Additionally, the valid tag according to the given list of part-of-speech tags in the description is “DT” for Determiner and “WRB” for Wh-Adverb. Hence, \"DD\" and \"WC\" are not valid tags based on the provided list. \"NN\" is a correct tag, but since multiple outputs are provided and the invalid tags are included, it violates the description’s requirement to return just one valid tag. This clear violation is that the output includes incorrect and multiple tags instead of a single valid part-of-speech tag.\n\nERR"
