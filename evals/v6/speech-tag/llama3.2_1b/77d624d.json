The output contains the following issues:\n\n1. The output includes multiple responses (\"CC: Ex\", \"Word tag: JJ (Adjective)\", \"CantAnswer\"), which indicates more than just the tag or phrases \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" are being provided. \n\n2. There is additional information provided, including a \"sentence breakdown\" and notes explaining why certain words are tagged in a way or another. The description specifies that only the tag or specific phrases should be returned, without any additional explanation or breakdown. \n\n3. The description does not mention any \"Word tag\", so this is not compliant either.\n\nBecause of these violations, the output does not comply with the description provided. The task is to return only a part-of-speech tag or the specific phrases \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" without additional explanations or multiple responses.\n\nERR"
