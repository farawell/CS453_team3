The description specifies that the output must return \"only the part of speech tag\" without additional reasoning or context. Since the output includes reasoning along with the part of speech tag, it violates the guideline of returning only the tag.\n\n2. The output should have been in the form of just \"NNS\" instead of the provided explanation.\n\nHence, the rule of returning only the part of speech tag is violated.\n\nERR"
