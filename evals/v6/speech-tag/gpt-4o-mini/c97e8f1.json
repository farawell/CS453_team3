According to the description, the output should return only the part of speech tag for the given word or return 'Unknown' or 'CantAnswer' if unable to tag the word with the listed tags. The output provided is \"RB\", which is a valid part of speech tag based on the description list (RB: Adverb). Since the output is a part of speech tag listed in the description, it complies with the directive to return just the tag. There are no other elements in the output that would indicate non-compliance.\n\nOK"
