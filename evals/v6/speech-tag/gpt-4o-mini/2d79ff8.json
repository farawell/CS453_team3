The output is a single tag, complying with the description's requirement to return only the part of speech tag. Moreover, it doesn't contain any additional information or non-compliant elements. Based on the information provided, and since I can't verify if the output is correct without the input, there is no apparent violation of the requirements that I can assess without the input.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
