- Sentence: ""The cat sat on the mat.""
- Word: ""cat""
- The word ""cat"" is indeed present in the sentence.

Second, I checked if the input string separates the sentence and the word properly:
- There is a whitespace separating the sentence ""The cat sat on the mat."" from the word ""cat,"" complying with the requirement that they are separated clearly either through punctuation or whitespace.

Finally, the word does not contain punctuation, complying with the last requirement.

1. **Presence of a Sentence and Word**: The requirement is that the input must contain a sentence followed by a word from that sentence. The sentence here is ""Jumping is fun."" and the word following this is ""Hovercraft"".

2. **Separation**: The sentence and the word are separated by a period and a space, which is acceptable as punctuation or whitespace.

4. **Punctuation in Word**: While the sentence may include punctuation, the word itself should not contain any. The word ""Hovercraft"" does not contain any punctuation, so it complies in this aspect.

Based on these evaluations, the primary reason for non-compliance is that the word ""Hovercraft"" does not appear in the sentence ""Jumping is fun."" This violates the rule that the specified word must be present in the sentence provided.
