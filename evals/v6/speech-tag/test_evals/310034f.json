  "validityText": "The input consists of what appears to be a sentence followed by a word. The input specification requires that the input should be a single string containing both a sentence and a word from that sentence, clearly separated either through punctuation or whitespace.\n\n1. **Sentence Check:** \n   - The sentence given is \"Can you lend me five dollars?\" which is a valid sentence and it seems complete.\n\n2. **Word Check:** \n   - The word provided is \"dollars\".\n   - The word \"dollars\" is indeed present within the sentence.\n\n3. **Separation Check:**\n   - The input has two parts: a sentence and a word, each labeled explicitly. Although the sentence and the word are separated by punctuation (colon and newline), they need to be presented as a single string with a clear separation between the sentence and the word through regular punctuation or whitespace.\n\n4. **Combining Factors:**\n   - The sentence and the word should ideally be presented together in a single string without explicit labeling (\"sentence:\" and \"word:\") that is not mentioned in the input specification, which makes this representation incorrect.\n\nThe key violation here is that the input does not fit into a single string format reflecting a sentence with a word separated by just punctuation or whitespace as elaborated in the input specification. Instead, it uses labels to separate the sentence and word.\n\nERR",
