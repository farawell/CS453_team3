  "validityText": "First, I will evaluate the input based on the provided input specification. The input must contain a well-constructed sentence followed by a word from that sentence, with a clear separation between the sentence and the word.\n\nUpon analyzing the input:\n- The sentence provided is: \"If you're ready, we can start the meeting.\" This is a complete sentence with appropriate punctuation.\n- The sentence is clearly separated from the word by a newline.\n- The word given is \"if\". \n\nHowever, upon closely inspecting the sentence, we see that the sentence starts with \"If\" with an initial capital letter. In English, capitalization can make a difference in terms of identification of words, especially in the context of matching a word within a sentence. Here, \"If\" (capitalized) is different from \"if\" (lowercase). The word \"if\" is not exactly present in the sentence because the only instance of it is \"If\" at the start, capitalized due to its position. Therefore, \"if\" does not match exactly with any word present in the sentence according to the strict definition of a word which can be case-sensitive.\n\nGiven these observations, the input does not comply with the requirement that the word must be a single word present in the sentence, as there is a case discrepancy.\n\nERR",
