In the given input, the separation between the sentence \"Birds fly in the sky.\" and the word \"fly\" is done through a space. This satisfies the separation requirement.\n\n2. **Sentence Composition**: The sentence \"Birds fly in the sky.\" contains multiple words which is acceptable as per the specification.\n\n3. **Word Presence**: The word provided after the sentence must be a single word present in the sentence. The word \"fly\" is indeed present in the sentence \"Birds fly in the sky.\" and is provided as the single word following the sentence. The word itself doesn't contain any punctuation, thus complying with this part of the input specification.\n\nSince all the elements of the input comply with the given specification, based on this analysis, I conclude that the input meets the requirements specified.\n\nOK",
