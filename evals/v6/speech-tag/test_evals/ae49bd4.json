  "validityText": "To evaluate the input, let's break down the specifications and analyze the input against each rule:\n\n1. **The input must be a string containing a sentence followed by a word from that sentence.**\n   - The input is indeed a string containing a sentence: \"I want to learn all languages.\" followed by the word \"want.\"\n\n2. **The input string must clearly separate the sentence and the word, either through punctuation or whitespace.**\n   - There is a space separating the sentence \"I want to learn all languages.\" and the word \"want,\" which constitutes clear separation through whitespace.\n\n3. **The input sentence can contain any number of words.**\n   - The sentence \"I want to learn all languages.\" contains multiple words, which is valid.\n\n4. **The input word must be a single word present in the sentence.**\n   - The word \"want\" is indeed a single word and is present in the sentence.\n\n5. **The sentence may include punctuation marks, but the word to be tagged should not contain punctuation.**\n   - The sentence includes a period at the end, which is appropriate. The word \"want\" does not include any punctuation, which is correct as per the specification.\n\nSince the input \"I want to learn all languages. want\" adheres to all parts of the provided input specification, the assessment is that there are no violations.\n\nOK",
