  "validityText": "Upon analyzing the given input against the specified criteria, let's break down the components of the input:\n\n1. **Sentence provided**: \"I wonder what would happen next.\" - This is a complete sentence that contains multiple words and includes punctuation, specifically a period at the end.\n\n2. **Word provided**: \"what\" - This is a single word that is extracted from the sentence provided.\n\n3. **Separation**: The sentence and the word are separated by what appears to be a double whitespace and a newline. This indicates a clear separation between the two components.\n\nNow, let us verify compliance with the rules in the input specification:\n\n- The input **must be a string** containing a sentence followed by a word from that sentence (This condition is satisfied as the input contains such a sentence and the word \"what\" which is present in it).\n\n- The input string **must clearly separate** the sentence and the word, either through punctuation or whitespace (The sentence and the word are clearly on separate lines, suggesting clear separation with a newline between them).\n\n- The input sentence **can include punctuation**, but the word to be tagged **should not contain punctuation**. (The sentence ends with a period, which is acceptable, and the word \"what\" does not have any punctuation).\n\nSince all conditions of the provided input specification are met, the input complies with the specifications.\n\nOK",
