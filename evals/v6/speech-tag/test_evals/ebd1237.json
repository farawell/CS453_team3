The input also clearly separates these two parts through the use of punctuation and whitespace. Let's evaluate the input against the specification:\n\n1. **Sentence**: \"Despite the rain, we enjoyed the picnic.\" is a valid sentence containing multiple words and includes punctuation marks. The sentence construction adheres to the grammar rules commonly accepted in English.\n   \n2. **Word**: The word \"Despite\" is identified as the word from the sentence.
