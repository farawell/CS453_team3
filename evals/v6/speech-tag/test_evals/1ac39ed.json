  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence followed by a word, \"The sun rises in the east.\" and \"sun\". I will now evaluate compliance according to the input specification.\n\n1. The input must be a string containing a sentence followed by a word from that sentence. This condition is met because there is a sentence \"The sun rises in the east.\" followed by the word \"sun\".\n\n2. The input string must clearly separate the sentence and the word, either through punctuation or whitespace. Here, the sentence and the word appear to be separated by a whitespace, satisfying this rule.\n\n3. The input word must be a single word present in the sentence. The word \"sun\" is indeed a single word and is present in the sentence \"The sun rises in the east.\"\n\n4. The sentence may include punctuation marks, but the word to be tagged should not contain punctuation. The sentence contains a period, which is punctuation, and the word \"sun\" does not include any punctuation, thus meeting this part of the spec.\n\nIn conclusion, after verifying each condition of the specification, the input complies with all the rules.\n\nOK",
  "validity": "ok"
