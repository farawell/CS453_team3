  "validityText": "The given input contains two parts: a sentence and a word. Let's evaluate compliance with the input specification step by step:\n\n1. **Presence of a Sentence**: The initial part of the input, \"He whispered softly.\", is indeed a sentence. It contains multiple words and ends with a punctuation mark, which is valid per the input specification.\n\n2. **Separation of Sentence and Word**: The sentence \"He whispered softly.\" is separated from the word \"softly\" by a space, which clearly delineates the two parts as required by the input specification.\n\n3. **Single Word Requirement**: The word \"softly\" is a single word, fulfilling the specification requirement that the word must not contain punctuation.\n\n4. **Word Presence in Sentence**: The word \"softly\" is explicitly present in the sentence \"He whispered softly.\" This is compliant because the specification requires that the word must be present in the sentence.\n\nGiven the above points, all aspects of the input comply with the input specification. Therefore, there are no violations present.\n\nOK",
