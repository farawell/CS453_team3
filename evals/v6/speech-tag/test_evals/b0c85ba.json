  "coverage": "NNS",
  "validityText": "The input consists of a sentence followed by a word from that sentence, separated by punctuation and a newline which effectively acts as a delimiter. Here's my analysis:\n\n1. **Presence of a Sentence**: There is a sentence present: \"She sells seashells by the seashore.\"\n\n2. **Separation**: There is a clear separation between the sentence and the word. After the sentence terminates with a period, we move to a new line where we see \"word: seashells\" indicating the target word.\n\n3. **Word from the Sentence**: The word \"seashells\" is indeed present in the sentence.\n\n4. **Single Word**: The target word \"seashells\" is a single word without any punctuation attached to it, complying with the specification.\n\nGiven these observations, the input meets all required criteria as per the input specification.\n\nOK",
