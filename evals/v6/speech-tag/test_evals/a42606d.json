  "validityText": "The input provided consists of two parts: a sentence and a word from that sentence. The sentence is \"There are several reasons to be optimistic.\" and the word is \"There\".\n\n1. **Sentence Presence**: The input does contain a sentence: \"There are several reasons to be optimistic.\" This satisfies the requirement for a sentence to be present in the input.\n\n2. **Separation of Sentence and Word**: The sentence and word are separated by clear labeling using \"sentence: \" and \"word: \". This satisfies the requirement that the sentence and word must be clearly separated, either by punctuation or whitespace. In this case, the labels effectively separate the two components.\n\n3. **Word in Sentence**: The word specified is \"There\", which is indeed present in the sentence, as it is the first word. This satisfies the criterion that the input word must be a single word present in the sentence.\n\n4. **Punctuation in Word**: The specified word, \"There\", does not contain any punctuation, which complies with the input specification.\n\nThe input adheres to all conditions outlined in the input specification. There are no violations observed.\n\nOK",
