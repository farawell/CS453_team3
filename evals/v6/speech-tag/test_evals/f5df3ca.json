In the given string, \"Can you solve this easier?\" qualifies as a sentence.\n\n2. **Separation between Sentence and Word**: There must be a clear separation between the sentence and the word, either through punctuation or whitespace. In the input, the sentence \"Can you solve this easier?\" is followed by the term \"xyz\" with a space in between. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied as well.\n\n3. **Single Word from Sentence**: The word provided after the sentence should be a single word present within the sentence. In this case, the term \"xyz\" is provided after the sentence \"Can you solve this easier?\". However, the word \"xyz\" is not a part of the sentence \"Can you solve this easier?\". As per the given sentence, none of the words (\"Can\", \"you\", \"solve\", \"this\", \"easier\") match \"xyz\". Hence, this criterion is not met.\n\nBased on these considerations, the input does not comply with the specification as the word is not present within the sentence.\n\nERR",
