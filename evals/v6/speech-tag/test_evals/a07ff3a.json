  "validityText": "The input given is: \"Jumping is fun. Hovercraft\". \n\nFirst, let's evaluate this input against the specification:\n\n1. **Presence of a Sentence and Word**: The requirement is that the input must contain a sentence followed by a word from that sentence. The sentence here is \"Jumping is fun.\" and the word following this is \"Hovercraft\".\n\n2. **Separation**: The sentence and the word are separated by a period and a space, which is acceptable as punctuation or whitespace.\n\n3. **Word Presence in Sentence**: The critical part of the specification is that the word provided after the sentence must be a single word present in that sentence. In this case, \"Hovercraft\" is not a word present in the sentence \"Jumping is fun.\"\n\n4. **Punctuation in Word**: While the sentence may include punctuation, the word itself should not contain any. The word \"Hovercraft\" does not contain any punctuation, so it complies in this aspect.\n\nBased on these evaluations, the primary reason for non-compliance is that the word \"Hovercraft\" does not appear in the sentence \"Jumping is fun.\" This violates the rule that the specified word must be present in the sentence provided.\n\nERR",
