In this input, there is a notable separation with the use of keywords \"sentence:\" and \"word:\" which ensures clarity in what is being defined as the sentence and what is being defined as the word.\n\n2. **Presence of the Word in the Sentence**: The word should be a single word present in the sentence. Here, the word \"Unfortunately\" is clearly present at the start of the given sentence \"Unfortunately, we could not attend the meeting.\"\n\n3. **Punctuation**: The sentence may include punctuation marks, and it does have a comma. However, the word to be tagged should not contain punctuation, and the word \"Unfortunately\" is free of any punctuation.\n\nGiven the input data and following the outlined specification, the input complies with all the guidelines: \n- The sentence and word are clearly separated.\n- The specified word is accurately found within the sentence.\n- The word is presented without any punctuation.\n\nDespite the presence of a minor newline, there is no part of the specification that disallows this, thus the input meets all given criteria strictly as per the specification.\n\nOK",
