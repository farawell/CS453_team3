  "validityText": "The input consists of two parts: a sentence \"Does he still see the stars?\" and a word \"seingly\". Based on the input specification:\n\n1. The sentence and word must be clearly separated, either through punctuation or whitespace. In this input, there is a whitespace separating the sentence from the word, satisfying this part of the specification.\n\n2. The sentence can contain any number of words, and it may include punctuation marks. The sentence \"Does he still see the stars?\" meets both of these criteria as it consists of multiple words and includes a question mark which is a punctuation mark.\n\n3. The input word must be a single word present in the sentence and should not contain punctuation. The given word \"seingly\" does not contain any punctuation, satisfying that part of the specification.\n\nHowever, the critical part of the specification that has been violated is that the input word must actually be present in the sentence. In the sentence \"Does he still see the stars?\", the word \"seingly\" is not present. Therefore, the input fails to comply with the requirement that the input word is a part of the input sentence.\n\nERR",
