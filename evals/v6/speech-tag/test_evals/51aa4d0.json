According to the input specification, the word must be a single word that is present in the sentence. In this input, \"Xyzword\" does not appear anywhere within the sentence. This violates the input specification which clearly states that the word must be present in the sentence. Therefore, there is a violation due to this mismatch.\n\nERR",
