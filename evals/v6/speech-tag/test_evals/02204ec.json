The input string must clearly separate the sentence and the word, either through punctuation or whitespace.\n3. The input sentence can contain any number of words.\n4. The input word must be a single word present in the sentence.\n5. The sentence may include punctuation marks, but the word to be tagged should not contain punctuation.\n\nGiven the input:\n- \"The cat sat on the mat. cat\"\n\nFirst, I checked if there's a sentence followed by a word from that sentence: \n- Sentence: \"The cat sat on the mat.\"\n- Word: \"cat\"\n- The word \"cat\" is indeed present in the sentence.\n\nSecond, I checked if the input string separates the sentence and the word properly:\n- There is a whitespace separating the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat.\" from the word \"cat,\" complying with the requirement that they are separated clearly either through punctuation or whitespace.\n\nFinally, the word does not contain punctuation, complying with the last requirement.\n\nUpon thorough examination, there is no violation of the specifications.\n\nOK",
