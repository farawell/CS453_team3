  "validityText": "To evaluate the given input against the specification, let's analyze each part:\n\n1. **Sentence and Word Separation**: The input includes a phrase labeled as \"sentence,\" which contains \"We heard that she won the competition.\" The separator \"word:\" clearly divides the sentence from the word \"that.\" Thus, the input uses a colon and presumably a newline to separate the sentence and the word, which aligns with the requirement to clearly separate these two parts.\n\n2. **Presence of Word in Sentence**: The word provided is \"that,\" and it is indeed found within the sentence \"We heard that she won the competition.\" This complies with the requirement that the input word must be a single word present in the sentence.\n\n3. **Punctuation in Sentence**: The sentence contains a period at the end, which is acceptable, as punctuation marks are allowed in the sentence. \n\n4. **Punctuation in Word**: The word is \"that\" and does not contain any punctuation, which is in accordance with the rule that the word itself should not have punctuation.\n\nEach part of the input complies with the specified conditions: clear separation between the sentence and word is maintained, the word is a part of the provided sentence, and punctuation rules are followed. Therefore, the input satisfies all the criteria in the specification. \n\nOK",
