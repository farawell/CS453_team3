  "validityText": "To evaluate the compliance of the given input with the provided specification, let's break it down:\n\n1. **Input Format**: The input consists of two components: a sentence and a word. \n\n2. **Sentence Compliance**: The sentence is \"Could you please scoot over a bit?\" which is a valid sentence containing multiple words and punctuation.\n\n3. **Word Compliance**: The provided word is \"over\". It is important to verify that this word is:\n   - A single word.\n   - Present in the sentence.\n\n4. **Separation Between Sentence and Word**: The input must clearly separate the sentence and the word. In this case, the sentence and word are separated by the labels \"sentence:\" and \"word:\", which is a clear separation in the input structure through punctuation (colon and whitespace).\n\nLet's go through the checklist:\n\n- The input contains a sentence.\n- The input provides a single word: \"over\".\n- The word \"over\" is present in the sentence \"Could you please scoot over a bit?\"\n- The separation between the sentence and the word is clear and unambiguous.\n\nGiven the above considerations, the input meets the input specification as it provides a valid sentence, a single word from that sentence, and a clear separation between the two components. Therefore, the input complies with the specification.\n\nOK",
