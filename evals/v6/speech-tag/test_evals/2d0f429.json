  "validityText": "Upon evaluating the provided input, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. **Separation of Sentence and Word**: The sentence \"She can ski very well if she wants.\" is separated from the word \"well\" by a period followed by a space. This separation adheres to the requirement of clearly separating the sentence and the word, either through punctuation or whitespace.\n\n2. **Presence of Word in Sentence**: The word \"well\" is indeed a single word present in the sentence \"She can ski very well if she wants.\". This complies with the requirement that the input word must be a single word present in the sentence.\n\n3. **Punctuation**: The sentence contains punctuation (the period at the end), but this does not violate the input specification as the word to be tagged (\"well\") does not contain punctuation.\n\nUpon considering the provided input against the input specification, there are no violations. The sentence and word are appropriately separated and the word exists within the sentence as required.\n\nOK",
