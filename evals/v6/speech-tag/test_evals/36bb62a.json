  "validityText": "To evaluate the given input, let's break it down according to the input specification:\n\n1. **Sentence and Word Separation**: The input must clearly separate the sentence and the word. Here, the sentence and the word are separated by labeling them with \"sentence:\" and \"word:\". The separation is clear, thus complying with this requirement.\n\n2. **Input Sentence**: The sentence given is \"This is the footnote reference¹ in the text.\" This is a valid sentence containing multiple words as allowed by the input specification.\n\n3. **Input Word**: The word provided is \"¹\". According to the input specification, the word to be tagged should not contain punctuation. In this context, the character \"¹\" is a footnote symbol and not a typical alphanumeric word, thus violating the specification.\n\n4. **Presence in Sentence**: Although the word \"¹\" is present in the sentence, it does not comply with the requirement for the word to be a single word free of punctuation.\n\nBased on these considerations, the violation comes from the fact that the input word does not meet the requirement of being a single, punctuation-free word. The character \"¹\", being a footnote reference or symbol, is not treated as a standard word for the purposes of this input specification.\n\nERR",
