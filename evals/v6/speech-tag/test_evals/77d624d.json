  "validityText": "The given input consists of a sentence \"Call me when you arrive home.\" and a word \"arrive\". According to the input specification, the input must be a string containing a sentence followed by a word from that sentence, and the sentence and the word must be clearly separated through punctuation or whitespace. \n\n1. The sentence \"Call me when you arrive home.\" is provided, which includes spaces and a period at the end, which are acceptable within the sentence as per the specification.\n2. The word \"arrive\" is a single word present in the sentence \"Call me when you arrive home.\" (specifically in the phrase \"you arrive\") and does not contain punctuation. This fulfils the requirement that the word must be in the sentence and must not contain punctuation.\n3. The word \"arrive\" follows a colon (i.e., \"word: \") which is a punctuation. This satisfies the condition of having a clear separation between the sentence and the word using punctuation.\n\nNo input specification violations are observable here, and all conditions for specification compliance are met.\n\nOK",
