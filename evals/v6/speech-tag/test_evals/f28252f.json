The sentence is \"I'll see you on Monday.\" and the specified word is \"Monday\". \n\nAccording to the specifications:\n1. The input string must clearly separate the sentence and the word, and here, a colon and whitespace separate them.\n2. The sentence can contain punctuation, which is valid because the sentence includes an apostrophe and a period.\n3. The word mentioned should be a single word present in the sentence, without punctuation, which is true as \"Monday\" is a word in the sentence and is presented without punctuation.\n\nThere are no issues with separator syntax or the presence of the word in the sentence. This input meets all the conditions laid out by the specification.\n\nOK",
