Specifically, \"WP\" stands for \"Wh-pronoun,\" which is included in the alphabetical list of tags provided. The output is a single part-of-speech tag, which aligns with the instructions to return only the tag. As we are not provided with the input sentence and word, we cannot check the functional correctness of the tag, but compliance is not dependent on input. Therefore, the output meets the compliance criteria set out in the task description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
