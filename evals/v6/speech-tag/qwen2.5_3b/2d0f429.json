  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot is \"VBＺ\". According to the description, the chatbot is supposed to return a part of speech tag. The part of speech tags are strictly defined in the description, and they do not include any non-standard characters. The tag \"VBＺ\" contains a non-standard character 'Ｚ' that is not part of the standard set of tags, which use only standard ASCII characters. This suggests that there may be a problem with the character encoding or a typo. The correct tag should be \"VBZ\" for Verb, 3rd person singular present, without any special characters. \n\nERR"
