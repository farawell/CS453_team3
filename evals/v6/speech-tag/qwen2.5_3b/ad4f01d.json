The presence of multiple tags in the output suggests that the chatbot did not comply with the instruction to return just one appropriate part-of-speech tag for a given word. The description also states that if the word cannot be tagged with one of the listed tags, the output should be \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer,\" but these options are not utilized here.\n\nERR"
