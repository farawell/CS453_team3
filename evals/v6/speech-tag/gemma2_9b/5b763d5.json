The instructions dictate that the chatbot should return only the part of speech tag or \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags. Since \"VBG\" is a listed tag that refers to \"Verb, gerund or present participle\", the output is compliant with the given description as it does not present any additional information or deviate from what is required by the instructions. Therefore, the output is in compliance.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
