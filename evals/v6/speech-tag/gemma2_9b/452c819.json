Since both the formatting corresponds with the patterns such as exactly matches the POS tags list available in the description with \"RB\" indicating an adverb, it seems to be in line with the requirements of only outputting the tag. There is no additional information or incorrectly formatted output present.\n\nSince the evaluation does not require me to determine if 'RB' is the correct tag for the word, I will not consider correctness. The output format aligns with the description's requirement of providing only a POS tag.\n\nOK"
