In this output, \"RB\" is the tag provided, which is listed among the possible tags (RB: Adverb). The prefix \"##\" before the tag does not comply with the guideline of providing \"just the tag\" as it introduces extraneous characters, which violates the output requirement. Hence, the output includes extra symbols which should not be there.\n\nERR"
