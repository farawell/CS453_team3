According to the description, the chatbot's purpose is to classify a given text into one of the specified categories: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech. The output, however, suggests difficulty in classifying the text accurately without complete information, which is outside the scope of the task as the description doesn't mention needing complete names or additional information to classify an article. Furthermore, the description does not indicate that explanations or reasoning are necessary in the output after classification. The chatbot is expected to directly classify the text into one of the categories without needing to explain the reasoning or express uncertainty. \n\nERR"
