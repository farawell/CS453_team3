  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the description provided. The description specifies that the chatbot should classify an input news article into one of the categories: World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech. However, the chatbot's output introduces a new category, \"News/Business,\" which does not match the given categories. Moreover, the chatbot output includes a list of categories and examples that are not part of the description provided, introducing categories such as \"Safety,\" \"Entertainment,\" and discussing \"Jailbreak,\" which are not relevant according to the description. The instruction clearly restricts classification to four specific categories, and the expansion to additional categories is a violation of the compliance guidelines.\n\nERR"
