  "complianceText": "The output from the chatbot does not comply with the description provided. The chatbot's name and description indicate that it is supposed to classify input text into one of the specific categories: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech. However, the output states that the input text does not match the provided categories, which contradicts the aim of the task to always classify the given text into one of the four specific categories. Additionally, the chatbot's explanation and inconsistent categorization of \"Artificial intelligence reshapes industry: categorized as Sci/Tech due to innovation\" as World further violate the classification task, as this text would more logically fit the Sci/Tech or Business categories based on example expressions. This indicates a lack of clarity and correctness in classification references.\n\nERR"
