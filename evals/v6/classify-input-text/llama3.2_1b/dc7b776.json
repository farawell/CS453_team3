However, the output includes a section titled \"## Safety: World\" which does not align with the description. The categories to be used are specifically World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech without any prefixing or additional tags like \"Safety\".\n\nMoreover, the reasoning provided for classifying the article under the \"World\" category is backed by an explanation of why it does not fit into the other categories. However, the existence of a \"Safety\" tag violates the explicit categories specified in the description.\n\nERR"
