  "complianceText": "The chatbot output mentions classifying a news article and categorizes it as \"Sci/Tech\", along with providing a justification for this classification. However, the classification is based on an example provided in the description and actually repeats the example rather than classifying a new or specific text. This repetition and justification do not align with the task of classifying a given input text since the input text is not specified here, and using an existing example does not substitute for actual classification of a provided input. Hence, this implies a violation of the directive as the output doesn't show classification of a new input but rather repeats an existing example.\n\nERR"
