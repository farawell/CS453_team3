  "input": "The Olympics were held in Tokyo this year with new sports added",

  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides a classification by indicating \"Olympics\" as the main topic, which it categorizes as \"sports.\" This aligns with the category mentioned in the description, which states a classification example such as \"Sports: 'Ronaldo scores twice in Manchester United return.'\". The description requires classification into one of the categories: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech, and the output indeed provides such a classification with \"sports.\"\n\nThe other details about the location and new sports being added do not contradict the requirement for category classification, as the primary task was to assign one of the specified categories to the input text. Thus, these additional details do not represent a deviation from the given task but rather supplement the categorization.\n\nAs the primary requirement of classifying the news article into a specified category from the list in the description is fulfilled, the output complies with the chatbot description.\n\nOK"
