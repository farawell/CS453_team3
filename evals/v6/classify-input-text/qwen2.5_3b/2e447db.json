The chatbot is supposed to classify the input text strictly into one of the four categories: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech. Introducing a new category not mentioned in the description violates the compliance requirement. The output also refers to conditions and decisions related to code sections which are irrelevant since no instructions were given in code sections as per the description. Therefore, the output does not comply with the description as it diverges from the specified categories.\n\nERR"
