  "output": "The news article \"Record-breaking solar-powered car race held\" can be categorized as **Sci/Tech**.\n\nWhile it is indeed a record-setting event and could potentially fall under Sports (as some competitions and events are classified under Sports), the primary focus here seems to be on the scientific and technological achievement rather than being a sporting competition. Solar cars often highlight advancements in technology, not just physical prowess or traditional sports competitions. Therefore, categorizing it as **Sci/Tech** would be more appropriate.",
