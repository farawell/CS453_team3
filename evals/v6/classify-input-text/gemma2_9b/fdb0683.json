It mentions that the text is not a typical news article, and due to this disclaimer, it finds it unclear how to classify the input within the specified categories. The output also suggests that the text could relate to cybersecurity or ethical hacking, hinting at a broader category like \"Technology & Security,\" which does not align with the given specific categories of World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech.\n\nThe description mandates that the chatbot should classify the input text into one of the specified categories without suggesting or inventing new categories. As such, proposing a category that isn't one of the provided ones, and displaying uncertainty about the context, indicates non-compliance with the requirement to classify the article into the described categories.\n\nERR"
