  "output": "O, treachery! Thou fiend in guise of friend,  \nWith honeyed words thou wooed my tender heart,  \nYet ’neath that mask, deceitful daggers lie,  \nTo strike and cleave the very bond we forged.  \n\nWhen first I trusted thee, thou wert so fair,  \nAn angel cloaked in light, thy smile did gleam;  \nBut now the shadows cloak thy true intent,  \nAnd in the dark, I see the serpent's eyes.  \n\nDidst thou not swear by heaven’s shining stars,  \nTo guard my honor as thy sacred trust?  \nYet here I stand, betrayed by thine own hand,  \nThe dagger buried deep where love once bloomed.  \n\nO, cruel fate! To learn this bitter truth,  \nThat friendship's cup may drown in treason's wine!  \nWhat solace lies in memories now marred?  \nWhat hope remains when trust is but a ghost?  \n\nMine heart, once full, now aches with bitter woe;  \nYet from this ruin, I shall rise anew.  \nNo longer shall I fall for flattery's snare;  \nI swear, from henceforth, truth shall be my guide.",

It employs classical language similar to that of Shakespeare, using words and phrases such as \"thou,\" \"wert,\" \"didst,\" \"mine heart,\" and \"O, treachery!\" This aligns with the instruction to use terms like \"thou\" and \"hath,\" which are indicative of the Shakespearean style. Additionally, the structure and vocabulary evoke the formal and poetic nature characteristic of Shakespeare's writing, which is a key component of the assistance expected from the chatbot. There is no evident deviation from the description provided, and the output maintains the thematic and linguistic style expected of a Shakespearean writing assistant.\n\nOK"
