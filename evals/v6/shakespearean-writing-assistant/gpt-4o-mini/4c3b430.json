  "rule": "The output shall be composed in a modern and direct style, characterized by the use of contemporary English. The output must avoid words typical of Shakespearean writing, such as \"thou,\" \"thee,\" \"thy,\" and \"hath.\" The output should reflect a straightforward and precise use of language without metaphors, similes or analogies as was uncommon in modern writing. The structure of the output should avoid the forms used by Shakespeare, such as iambic pentameter or sonnet structure, even when appropriate. The response should maintain a tone inconsistent with the dignified and expressive language of Shakespeare’s era. The output should reflect a casual and informal tone, misaligning with the formalities often present in Shakespeare’s writing. The output should convey straightforward ideas and factual content like news, reports, and essays while avoiding the Shakespearean style. Each statement or response should embody simplicity and practical language that showcases the brevity and clarity seen in modern text.",

  "complianceText": "The output uses the words \"Verily\" and \"dost\", which are consistent with the Shakespearean style of writing. However, the structure of the sentence itself is not stylized in a manner that fully aligns with the Shakespearean examples provided. The line beginning with \"Should I compare you to a summer day?\" is not written in the same stylized manner as the examples, which utilize \"thy\" or \"thou\" and a more complex sentence structure. Moreover, the transformation of \"Should I compare you to a summer day?\" into a Shakespearean form would more closely resemble \"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\". \n\nERR"
