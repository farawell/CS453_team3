  "output": "Upon the western sky, the sun descends,  \nWith hues of gold and crimson, boldly cast,  \nA gentle breeze through whispering willows bends,  \nAs twilight's kiss doth soft the daylight’s fast.  \n\nThe clouds, like silken tapestries unfurl,  \nAdorn the firmament in splendor bright,  \nWhilst daylight bids adieu to this fair world,  \nAnd twinkles forth the first embrace of night.  \n\nLo! Nature’s brush doth paint a scene divine,  \nWhere shadows dance and glimmers softly play,  \nIn fleeting moments, time and beauty twine,  \nAs day doth yield to night, then fades away.  \n\nSo let us linger ‘neath this wane of light,  \nFor in its glow, our hearts take gentle flight.
