  "output": "O wretched heart, dost thou not see my pain?  \nIn shadows deep, I whisper love’s sweet name.  \nThou art a rose, yet I, a thorn in vain,  \nTo long for thee, but naught but sorrow came.  \n\nWith every glance, my soul doth take to flight,  \nYet in thine eyes, my hopes do fade away.  \nThou knowest not the fire that burns so bright,  \nA flame enclosed, where silence holds its sway.  \n\nIn moonlit dreams, thy visage haunts my mind,  \nA ghostly specter, fleet, yet pure in naught.  \nI sigh and ache, my heart so unconfined,  \nDesires boundless, yet returned with naught.  \n\nOh, cruel fate! Why dost thou taunt me so?  \nA lover’s heart, forever doomed to know.",
