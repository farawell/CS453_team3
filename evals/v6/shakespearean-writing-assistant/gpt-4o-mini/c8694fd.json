  "output": "O gentle friend, within this heart of mine  \nA shadow doth reside, forsooth, I did forget  \nThe day that marks thy birth, a day divine,  \nWherein the stars did shine, and joy was set.  \n\nForgive me, I implore, for my neglect,  \nMy thoughts for thee were cast upon the breeze,  \nYet in my error lies no slight suspect,  \nFor thou art dear, and bring’st me great unease.  \n\nWith heavy heart, I pen this humble plea,  \nTo seek thy grace and mend this cruel mistake;  \nLet not my lapse reduce our camaraderie,  \nBut for thy kindness' sake, new bonds we’ll make.  \n\nSo let us gather soon, and I shall pay  \nWith gifts and laughter to celebrate thy day.",
