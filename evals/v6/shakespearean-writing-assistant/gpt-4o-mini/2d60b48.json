  "output": "Upon the dawn, when light doth gently break,  \nThe golden sun begins its noble rise,  \nIn hues of amber, every shadow shake,  \nTo warm the earth beneath the azure skies.  \n\nWith rays that weave a tapestry of gold,  \nEach glimmer dances on the dew-kissed blades,  \nA symphony of warmth, a tale retold,  \nAs nature's heart in vibrant light parades.  \n\nThe lark doth sing, her dulcet notes take flight,  \nAs blossoms yawn and stretch with sweet delight,  \nAwake, dear world, embrace this hallowed morn,  \nFor in this beauty, life anew is born.  \n\nThus, let thy spirit drink the sun's bright cheer,  \nFor every blessed day, the dawn draws near.",
