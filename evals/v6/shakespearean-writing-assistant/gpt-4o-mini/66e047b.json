  "output": "In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,  \nTwo hearts dost dwell, entwined in passion's dream.  \nJuliet, a maiden of beauty rare,  \nAnd Romeo, a youth with tender care.  \n\nTheir families, sworn foes in bitter strife,  \nDidst cast asunder the union of their life.  \nYet, fate, with cruel hand, did interpose,  \nAs love igniteth where enmity grows.  \n\nOne fateful night, beneath the pale moon’s gaze,  \nIn secret meeting, they didst share their praise.  \n\"Alas, my heart, thou art a beacon bright,  \nIn shadows cast by our kin's endless plight.\"  \n\nWith whispered vows and kisses soft as air,  \nThey dreamt of worlds where naught could cause despair.  \nYet, with the break of dawn, their hopes did fade,  \nFor destiny’s cruel hand on them had laid.  \n\nThrough folly’s grip, the lovers' paths did twist,  \nWith potion’s draught, weaved by a fate amiss.  \nBelieving death had claimed his beloved fair,  \nRomeo fell upon his sword in despair.  \n\nWhen Juliet didst awaken from her slumber deep,  \nAnd found her love bereft, in eternal sleep,  \nIn despair, she took her life in grief most dire,  \nFor love that conquer'd all—but lost to fate's cruel fire.  \n\nThus, in their tragic end, the families embraced,  \nThe sorrow of their hearts, the strife effaced.  \nFor love, though star-crossed, in death’s sweet release,  \nShowed that in unity there could be peace.",
