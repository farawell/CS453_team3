  "output": "Upon thee didst I cast mine eyes, hied me with my thoughts. And thought this time were I for another; but no, O woe! Thou hast entwined them thusly, and I am a traitor to my very soul.\nFor should the treachery be hid within, then might it better be. But loathsome sin thou dost in me have wrought; in mine own house dost thou have such sway.\nArt not I a lover of thy peace? Of thy contentment? Is this too little, O woe to thee!\nMy very heart now is but waxen hard, the walls within my breast are but doors for those who would infringe. Betrayal, what wilt thou do with me?\nFor should there be such an one as might not judge in justice, yet dost I myself condemn; for mine own hands I dare to stain.\nThus have I trod upon my self, and brought shame on thee both, O woe! O cruel time that twice hath from my eyes banished the light of day.",
