  "output": "Thou art the rose that blooms upon yon bough,  \nMore sweet than the primrose which doth grow  \nBy paths of sorrow and beneath the moon's light broad.  \nWherefore dost thou hold my heart with thine own rosy lore?\nWith thee in every breath I breathe anew  \nAnd through each silken thread of days doth love renew.  \nIn thy fair face, the heavens themselves appear;  \nOh make me one that can but gaze on thee for evermore.\nThou art the star that shin'st o'er my sleepy eyes,  \nA lighthouse in a night where there is nits of dies,  \nWith every glance dost thou me hold and bind,  \nMy heart doth cleave unto thy silver mind;  \nWherefore I come but forth to worship thee so high,  \nThou art the light that guides my soul through life.",
