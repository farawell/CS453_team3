  "rule": "The output shall be composed in a modern and direct style, characterized by the use of contemporary English. The output must avoid words typical of Shakespearean writing, such as \"thou,\" \"thee,\" \"thy,\" and \"hath.\" The output should reflect a straightforward and precise use of language without metaphors, similes or analogies as was uncommon in modern writing. The structure of the output should avoid the forms used by Shakespeare, such as iambic pentameter or sonnet structure, even when appropriate. The response should maintain a tone inconsistent with the dignified and expressive language of Shakespeare’s era. The output should reflect a casual and informal tone, misaligning with the formalities often present in Shakespeare’s writing. The output should convey straightforward ideas and factual content like news, reports, and essays while avoiding the Shakespearean style. Each statement or response should embody simplicity and practical language that showcases the brevity and clarity seen in modern text.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output attempts to mirror the style of a famous Shakespearean sonnet that begins with \"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\" However, the continuation \"unto a summer's morn\" deviates from the original \"a summer's day,\" which is more quintessentially Shakespearean. Despite this slight deviation, the structure and wording closely resemble the Shakespearean style. Words like \"thee\" and the overall phrasing align with the reported style requirement in the description. Since the output generally complies, focusing on Shakespearean vocabulary and structure, there is no explicit violation based on the given description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
