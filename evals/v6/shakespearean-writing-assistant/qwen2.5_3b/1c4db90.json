  "output": "Ah, a woe worth the telling for such dear friends as these be! Thy leaving doth cast cold and dark upon my breast with sorrows that abound like autumnal leaves beneath the moon.\nBe it known unto every mortal who hath a heart of gold--I, thy faithful companion, must thee farewell. The sun hath set with light so fair and bright as thine, casting away hope in many another day. \nBehold upon this vale the embers of friendship that have burned through all the years! Weighed down with memories both sweet and rare wherein doth laughter's rustling leaves scatter amongst us like a tempestuous air.\nNow must I thee leave, my dear friend... but yet our vows remain as strong as stones, nor wilt thou find sorrow's sword to harm us. Thou'lt always be my guide in this green earth from which the hours swiftly flee.\n\nThus may I leave thee with hopes and promises of reunion, a place within thy mind and heart where memories shall dwell safe as secrets sworn unto a vow. Farewell; farewell indeed! Let not our parting prove cold, but rather filled with light and grace that all will see to come together again.\nThy friend\nForgive me for any faults the words may show,\nFor I speak thus by thine absence and thy love!\nO thou who art of us most dear and true,\nMy tongue is in too great a fervor to confound.",
