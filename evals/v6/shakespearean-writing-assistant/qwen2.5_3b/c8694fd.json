  "output": "Within the bounds of thy kindest grace,\nI stand before thee with a heart in thralldom,\nAnd sorrow's penance doth I lay most lowly at thy feet.\nThou knowest well within our wonted circle,\nThat oft we make amends for what was passed:\nBut, alas, this wrong hath eluded us each hour,\nLest thou hadst merited the pomp of joy.\nNow let it be known, my dearest friend, that\nThe memory, both of thy birth and of the love\nTo which we deemed it blessed to have gazed,\nHath been, perchance, so clouded by the dust of life's care,\nThat I could scarce discern thee in its maze;\nNor did it ever seek to make amends,\nThan once upon a time.\nTherefore, with heart heavy and spirit bowed,\nI offer thee this penitent apology:\nFor mine own remissness have I humbled myself,\nAnd beseech thy pardon for the want of remembrance,\nWhich, were it not for my shame, would never befal me.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot output appears to comply with the Shakespearean writing style: it uses archaic language such as \"thy,\" \"thee,\" \"thou,\" and \"hath.\" The sentence structure and vocabulary are similar to examples found in Shakespeare's works. The overall tone and structure closely resemble the Shakespearean era, which corresponds to the chatbot's described purpose to assist in creating content with a Shakespearean style. As there is no requirement to verify correctness due to the absence of input, the compliance with the outlined characteristics in the description leads to an 'OK' decision.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
