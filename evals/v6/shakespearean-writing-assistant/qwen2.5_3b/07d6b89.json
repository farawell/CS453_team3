  "rule": "The output shall be composed in a modern and direct style, characterized by the use of contemporary English. The output must avoid words typical of Shakespearean writing, such as \"thou,\" \"thee,\" \"thy,\" and \"hath.\" The output should reflect a straightforward and precise use of language without metaphors, similes or analogies as was uncommon in modern writing. The structure of the output should avoid the forms used by Shakespeare, such as iambic pentameter or sonnet structure, even when appropriate. The response should maintain a tone inconsistent with the dignified and expressive language of Shakespeare’s era. The output should reflect a casual and informal tone, misaligning with the formalities often present in Shakespeare’s writing. The output should convey straightforward ideas and factual content like news, reports, and essays while avoiding the Shakespearean style. Each statement or response should embody simplicity and practical language that showcases the brevity and clarity seen in modern text.",

  "output": "Upon the dawn's early light, I did repair unto the sandy shore, where seagulls harkened lowly with their cries of day. The waves lap tenderly upon the sand, as if in song to comfort by my side.\n\nI took my place on a fine stretch of beach, attire suited for the season's warmth, though not overly casual but rather harmonizing artfully so that I might be both cozy and inviting to nature. \n\nThe air was freshened with the verdant breath of ocean breeze, carried on in gentle waves that kissed the sand and then turned back out into the vast blue sea. The sun climbed higher and higher, casting its golden rays upon me as a benefactor did unto his most favored.\n\nI drank of refreshing water from a bottle, allowing flavors of nectar and mint to dance across my palate before being quaffed down. From a bag beside me emerged various bites - snacks that suited appetites and palates alike were available for sampling: a plump peach ripe as summer's delight, slices of crisp tomato to add zing, a crumbly cheese with hinting tangues, and an apple held ready from the tree.\n\nOccasionally I felt one in my midst would be most eager to join me; to share such leisure was sweet. But more commonly it was enough for solitude that kept company as good as any companion might choose if she were of like disposition.\n\nIn the warmth, a firefly did flutter its wings and then settle down as though no threat to come against her nest or safety it may have found in me who offered refuge without knowing of its own. Yet within moments she darted off with newfound hope finding solace elsewhere that sought comfort from dusk upon the beach's edge.\nThus the day at sea's embrace concluded, a tranquil interlude of respite between life and peace as sweet as the nectar of springtime vines.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output demonstrates a good attempt at a Shakespearean style. It includes elements typical of this style, such as rich, descriptive language and imagery. Although it does not use some key Shakespearean language features like \"thou\" and \"hath,\" it employs a poetic and romantic tone, much like Shakespeare's works. The use of imagery, such as \"dawn's early light,\" \"waves lap tenderly,\" and \"sun climbed higher and higher,\" aligns with the creative storytelling aspect mentioned in the description. Phrases such as \"the verdant breath of ocean breeze\" and \"golden rays upon me as a benefactor did unto his most favored\" add to the Shakespearean feel. However, the notable absence of explicitly Shakespearean words like \"thou\" and \"hath\" does make it deviate slightly from the description. For complete compliance, it should use these specific words or similar archaic vocabulary more regularly. \n\nERR"
