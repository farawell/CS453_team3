  "output": "Upon an old moon's silver reign,\nWith constellations oft do we reign\nIn a universe that oft doth play,\nHath not the air of fate did sway my way.\n\nThou art Capulet, and I am Romeo.\nFrom days when fortune was but as the breeze,\nWe were ensnared in fates most strange and blest,\nBound by vows made to shadows' blessed rest.\n\nLove at first sight, albeit with trepidation\nMingled in the dust of life's early day,\nUpon each other did we lay our hearts.\nIt was not passion or desire that sown,\nBut rather stars themselves seemed to have decreed \nThat this union might be hallowed, though frowned upon.\n\nIn secret whispers, I did court thee fair,\nIn night's dim veil, under skies where no torch doth steal.\nThou wast but half my spirit in those brief hours,\nYet the rest of my heart was cast into thy sphere,\nAnd yet there were shadows still between our hearts,\nAs if they would never be rid from us.\n\nThe world around us grew more grim and gray,\nWhile the heavens did seem to whisper warnings,\nOf plots that sought to rend and wound this bond.\nFor when first I set foot on Montague's lawn,\nThou wast but maid, so tender yet fair;\nMy presence was but as a brand in thine eyes.\n\nThus did we walk on tenterhooks' stage,\nOur very breath oft carried us close to tears,\nBut yet beneath the moon do we still clung\nTo hope that love which shall make one's heart anew. \n\nYet when our secret came to light, and strife,\nThe winds of disaster did most fiercely blow,\nTearing asunder what once had grown so tight.\nAnd thus the paths between both doth diverge,\nAs fortune oft doth with lovers cruelly\nPlay tricks that they are not meant to know.\n\nThus hath my Romeo, though a name I dare not claim,\nHad he but ventured nearer of such bliss. \nBut now we must part for as it may be said.\nThough stars look with their beams and shadows cast,\nBoth didst thou choose this course, the skies will soon say\nThat in these love-versed lines there should no remedy.\n\nThus ends our tale of love's despair and loss,\nYet ever hope doth lend the dying breathes\nTo hearts that strive to conquer what hath been lost,\nIn hopes one day to find thee once again.",
