  "output": "Hark! Doth mine eyes deceive me, or hath treachery seeped\nInto the very core of my heart's most trusted keep? \nA serpent coiled within, its venom silent, deep,\nWhispering lies to those I held most dear in sleep.\n\nBy Jove! The trust we forged, a bond unbreakable and bold!\nHow fickle is the world, when tales of treachery unfold.\nMy soul doth rend itself, upon this truth untold, \nBetrayal's dagger pierces deep, leaving me broken, cold.\n\n\n",
