  "output": "Hark! As day doth wane and shadows creep,\nThe sun descends, a fiery orb on high,\nA crimson blush across the heavens deep,\nWhere clouds like painted tapestries do lie.\n\nFrom golden rays to hues of amber bright,\nIt casts its spell upon the world's embrace,\nThen fades to hues of lavender and white,\nA silent symphony in time and space.\n\nThe stars begin their twinkling vigil fair,\nAs twilight whispers tales of night serene,\nAnd yet, a memory lingers everywhere:\nThat wondrous blaze, a royal, vibrant scene.\n\nSo let us praise this spectacle divine,\nWhich doth each passing day with grandeur shine. \n\n\n",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The style of the text largely complies with the Shakespearean style described. It includes the use of \"doth,\" which is characteristic of Shakespearean language. The poem exhibits a Shakespearean-like structure with its formal and eloquent expression. There is attention to imagery and a rhythmic and lyrical quality consistent with the examples provided in the description. Although it doesn't use other specific words like \"thou\" or \"hath,\" the overall style seems to echo the elevated, poetic nature of Shakespeare's work. Hence, it fits within the spirit of the task, focusing on the creative and expressive style akin to Shakespeare.\n\nOK"
