  "output": "Hark! A blaze of gold doth paint the sky,\nAs slumber's veil upon the world is shed.\nThe sun awakes, and with his fiery eye,\nDispels the dark, and all new life doth spread.\nHis golden rays upon the dew-kissed grass,\nA shimmering dance of light, a sight to see.\nEach leaf bedecked in amber's warm caress,\nAnd flowers raise their heads, in ecstasy.\nThe birds awake, and with their joyful songs,\nAnnounce the dawn, a symphony so sweet.\nO golden sun, thou art where beauty throngs,\nA radiant king, thy presence we complete.\nFrom darkness deep, to light thou dost ascend,\nA masterpiece, by heaven's hand, 'tis penned. \n\n\n\n\nPlease let me know if  thou desirest further assistance in crafting thy poetic verse!",
