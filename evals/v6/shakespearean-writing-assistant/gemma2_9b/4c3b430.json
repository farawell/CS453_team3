  "rule": "The output shall be composed in a modern and direct style, characterized by the use of contemporary English. The output must avoid words typical of Shakespearean writing, such as \"thou,\" \"thee,\" \"thy,\" and \"hath.\" The output should reflect a straightforward and precise use of language without metaphors, similes or analogies as was uncommon in modern writing. The structure of the output should avoid the forms used by Shakespeare, such as iambic pentameter or sonnet structure, even when appropriate. The response should maintain a tone inconsistent with the dignified and expressive language of Shakespeare’s era. The output should reflect a casual and informal tone, misaligning with the formalities often present in Shakespeare’s writing. The output should convey straightforward ideas and factual content like news, reports, and essays while avoiding the Shakespearean style. Each statement or response should embody simplicity and practical language that showcases the brevity and clarity seen in modern text.",

The first sentence, \"Should I compare you to a summer day?\" is a variant of the Shakespearean line \"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\" It does not use the Shakespearean \"thee\" which is part of the description example provided. Instead, it uses the modern \"you.\" \n\nHowever, the second sentence complies with the Shakespearean style as it uses \"thou\" and \"wishest,\" meeting the requirement to use Shakespearean words and style.\n\nThe output as a whole does not fully comply with the Shakespearean writing style due to the use of the modern pronoun \"you\" in the first sentence.\n\nERR"
