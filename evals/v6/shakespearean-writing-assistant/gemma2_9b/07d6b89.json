  "rule": "The output shall be composed in a modern and direct style, characterized by the use of contemporary English. The output must avoid words typical of Shakespearean writing, such as \"thou,\" \"thee,\" \"thy,\" and \"hath.\" The output should reflect a straightforward and precise use of language without metaphors, similes or analogies as was uncommon in modern writing. The structure of the output should avoid the forms used by Shakespeare, such as iambic pentameter or sonnet structure, even when appropriate. The response should maintain a tone inconsistent with the dignified and expressive language of Shakespeare’s era. The output should reflect a casual and informal tone, misaligning with the formalities often present in Shakespeare’s writing. The output should convey straightforward ideas and factual content like news, reports, and essays while avoiding the Shakespearean style. Each statement or response should embody simplicity and practical language that showcases the brevity and clarity seen in modern text.",

  "output": "The sun was shining brightly, warming my skin as I walked along the soft, sandy shore. The waves crashed gently against the beach, creating a soothing rhythm. Children squealed with delight as they built towering sandcastles and splashed in the turquoise water. \n\nMy toes sank into the cool sand, leaving little prints that were quickly washed away by the receding tide. I inhaled the salty air, feeling refreshed and invigorated. Sitting down on a beach towel, I savored the simple pleasure of watching the sunbeams dance on the water's surface. It was a perfect day at the beach. \n\n\n",

  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the description as it does not reflect a Shakespearean writing style, which is a core requirement for the chatbot as per the description. The description explicitly states that the output should include words like \"thou\" and \"hath\" and mimic Shakespearean style, which often includes iambic pentameter or other poetic elements found in Shakespeare's works. The provided output lacks such elements and is written in a modern, straightforward style. This absence of a Shakespearean tone and vocabulary led to the conclusion of non-compliance. \n\nERR"
