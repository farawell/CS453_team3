  "output": "Hark! A tale I spin, of lovers doomed by fate,\n\nTwo hearts aflame, yet bound by cruel decree.\n\n\nYoung Rosalind, with beauty bright as morn,   \nA maiden pure, her spirit ever keen.\n\nBut Lord Montague, from house opposed and torn,\nLoved her in silence, a sorrow seldom seen. \n\nTheir families feuded, ancient wounds they bore,\n\nAnd kept them parted, like the moon from sun.\n\nYet love defied that hate-filled, bitter war,         \nThrough stolen glances 'neath a dusky one.\n\nOne night, 'neath stars in silver twilight's gleam,\nThey met and swore their bonds eternal be. \nBut treachery arose, a cruel scheme:\nLord Capulet, did young Montague decree! \n\n\nIn fury raged he, with sword in hand so bold,\nHis anger blinding, love forgotten cold.\n\nRosalind cried out, \"Peace! This senseless strife!\"\nBut met her doom, plunged into endless night.\nHer lover slain beside her, 'twas a blight,\nTheir love extinguished, lost beyond all sight.\n\n\n\nFrom grief they rose, to mend their broken ways, \nFor love had triumphed, even in demise's haze.  \n\nThe feud dissolved, a bond anew was made,\nAnd memory lived on, of those lovers betrayed.  \n\n\n",
