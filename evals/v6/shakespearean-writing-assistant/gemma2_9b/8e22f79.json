  "output": "A heavy burden doth my heart embrace, \nFor love unsung, a flame extinguished low.  \nMy soul yearns for thine eyes to meet my gaze,\nBut thou, alas, seest naught my passion's glow.\n\nLike willow branch that bends beneath the stream,\nSo doth my spirit waver, weak and frail.\nThy laughter rings, a symphony of dream,\nWhilst I remain in love's persistent vale.\n\nEach stolen glance, a treasure I possess,\nYet none returned, a mirror to my pain.\nOh, cruel fate! To yearn for thy caress, \nAnd know its warmth shall never be my gain. \n\n\n",
