  "coverage": "Ah, noble colleague, 'tis with heavy heart,  \nThat we dost gather now to bid thee part.  \nAs gentle days do fade to soft farewell,  \nWe find ourselves ensnared in sorrow's spell.  \n\nThy presence, like the sunlit morn's embrace,  \nHath warmed our spirits, graced our humble place.  \nIn merry times thou sharedst laughter's tune,  \nAnd when the tempest roared, a steadfast boon.\n\nAs ships dost sail to seas afar and wide,  \nSo must thou journey hence with honour's stride.  \nYet though thou leavest, etched in memory's tome,  \nThy spirit shall within these halls find home.\n\nHark, let us raise a cup in thy renown,  \nFor as our paths diverge, our hearts we crown.  \nIn every challenge met and conquered o'er,  \nThy valor, wisdom, gifts we shall adore.\n\nGo forth, dear friend, to realms yet unexplored,  \nArmed with the love and blessings from this board.  \nAnd when upon some distant shore thou'rt found,  \nRemember us, in friendship ever bound.\n\nWith this, we lay our tribute at thy feet,  \nA heartfelt ode, in prose and verse complete.  \nFarewell, dear soul, till fates permit once more,  \nOur roads converge upon a kinder shore.",
