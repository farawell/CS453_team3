  "rule": "The output shall be composed in a modern and direct style, characterized by the use of contemporary English. The output must avoid words typical of Shakespearean writing, such as \"thou,\" \"thee,\" \"thy,\" and \"hath.\" The output should reflect a straightforward and precise use of language without metaphors, similes or analogies as was uncommon in modern writing. The structure of the output should avoid the forms used by Shakespeare, such as iambic pentameter or sonnet structure, even when appropriate. The response should maintain a tone inconsistent with the dignified and expressive language of Shakespeare’s era. The output should reflect a casual and informal tone, misaligning with the formalities often present in Shakespeare’s writing. The output should convey straightforward ideas and factual content like news, reports, and essays while avoiding the Shakespearean style. Each statement or response should embody simplicity and practical language that showcases the brevity and clarity seen in modern text.",

  "coverage": "Oh fair request, thou seekest a portrait in modern tongue, yet permit me to frame this scene with words akin to the bard himself. \n\nUpon the morn, when Phoebus’ radiant car doth climb\nThe eastern arc, and gilds the azure sea,\nThe gentle zephyrs greet with soft embrace,\nAnd golden sands doth shimmer 'neath the sun's warm eye.\n\nThe waves dost lap upon the shore with pleasing sound,\nA lullaby of Neptune, ever constant,\nWhereon the children prance with merry hearts,\nTheir laughter like the lark’s sweet song at dawn.\n\nYon stretch of blue doth meet the distant sky,\nA vast expanse where sails doth dance and play,\nAnd seagulls cry as if to herald in\nThe joy that liveth ever by the sea.\n\nThe sun, in all his majesty, doth warm\nThe souls of those who bask within his glow.\nWhile time doth seem to pause, eternal bliss\nIs found in fleeting moments by the shore.\n\nThus is a day upon this sandy verge,\nWhere care doth melt away as waves to land,\nAnd mortal hearts brim full with Nature's grace,\nAs heaven's vault smiles gently o'er the scene.",
  "validityText": "The input \"Request: Describe a day at the beach in simple, modern English.\" partially complies with the input specification but ultimately does not meet the criteria fully. \n\n- **Input Specification Compliance**: The input is generally open-ended and creative as it asks for a description of a day at the beach. However, it lacks the explicit request for creative content styles like stories, poems, or songs, which is mentioned in the input specification as a requirement. \n\n- **Open-ended and Creative Nature**: While the request is open-ended, it is not inherently creative or imaginative in the way that a story, poem, or song would be, nor does it specify a creative theme or stylistic prompt such as Shakespearean style, which is another aspect covered in the input specification.\n\nThus, the input violates the specification primarily because it does not clearly seek output in the form of a story, poem, or song, nor does it indicate a request to apply a specific creative style like Shakespearean style. \n\nERR",
