The output must avoid words typical of Shakespearean writing, such as \"thou,\" \"thee,\" \"thy,\" and \"hath.\" The output should reflect a straightforward and precise use of language without metaphors, similes or analogies as was uncommon in modern writing. The structure of the output should avoid the forms used by Shakespeare, such as iambic pentameter or sonnet structure, even when appropriate. The response should maintain a tone inconsistent with the dignified and expressive language of Shakespeare’s era. The output should reflect a casual and informal tone, misaligning with the formalities often present in Shakespeare’s writing. The output should convey straightforward ideas and factual content like news, reports, and essays while avoiding the Shakespearean style. Each statement or response should embody simplicity and practical language that showcases the brevity and clarity seen in modern text.",

The input specification emphasizes that the request should be related to creating creative content, such as stories, poems, or songs, potentially in a Shakespearean style. The specification does not include writing news reports, which are factual and technical in nature, rather than creative.\n   \n2. The specification specifies open-ended or creative requests, mentioning specific creative styles like stories, poems, or songs. The given input is for a news report, which doesn't align with the creative content styles outlined in the input specification.\n\n3. The input specification clearly excludes factual or technical requests. News reports are inherently factual and thus fall outside the scope of the input specification.\n\nBased on these points, the input does not comply with the input specification, which focuses on creative writing in specified genres and potentially in a Shakespearean style.
