  "coverage": "In a realm where moonlit shadows doth dance upon the leafy glades of yore, there dwelt two hearts entwined in fate's cruel grasp. Yon tale unfolds in fair Verona's distant kin, where Fortune's wheel did spin with capricious glee.\n\nLo, in the house of Montague, sturdy and proud, did reside young Lysander, whose visage was as fair as Apollo's smile, and in his eyes a tempest of dreams did rove. Across the cobblestoned streets, in the bounteous abode of Capulet, lived the gentle Rosalinde, her beauty like Diana's own light, her spirit the song of nightingales in bloom.\n\nBy starlight's tender glow, an unlooked-for meeting did ensue at a banquet fit for Neptune's courts, where masks veiled not the ardor of mortal souls. Lysander, with heart afire, beheld Rosalinde, as Venus might spy the mortal Adonis, and thought, “O wondrous visage, dost thou stain the cheek of night with thy radiance?”\n\nRosalinde, with a glance that pierced as Cupid's dart, observed this gallant youth, and whispered to the zephyrs, “Methinks I hath found a star amidst this mortal coil.”\n\nYet, woe betides their gentle love, for between their kin did ancient enmity reside, a strife as old as the rocks of Time, decreeing that ne'er should a Montague in loving gaze upon a Capulet’s grace.\n\nAs the silent moon bore witness, beneath its azure gaze did they proclaim their love, as constant as the northern star, undying as the sea. Still, their hearts did tremble under fate's cruel jest, knowing well the tempest that brewed in the minds of men.\n\nIn secret alcoves and garden's shade, they did conspire to break these chains that bound their hearts in sorrow's snare. Yet destiny, clad in foreboding’s guise, did plot with cunning deceptions.\n\nIt came to pass one eve, when shadows lay heavy upon the earth, that Lysander braved the hollow night to seek his love, and with her fled to lands unknown, where peace might sprout from their united bond. But Fortune, mistress of mischief, bade the Fates to intervene.\n\nO cruel mischance! As the morning sun did rise, their plans unspooled like the threads of Clotho. For with a tragedy untold, the stars themselves did weep, as life departed their love in a final, fateful embrace.\n\nThus the tale of Lysander and Rosalinde ends, a sonnet of sweet melancholy writ upon the hearts of those who knew them. In death, their love was immortalized, a testament to the folly of warring houses and the transcendent power of love's eternal flame.\n\nIn solemn whisper across the ages, their tale doth echo: \"Love conquers not all, but endures beyond mortal strife, forever in the celestial symphony, enfolding our star-crossed epitome.\"",
