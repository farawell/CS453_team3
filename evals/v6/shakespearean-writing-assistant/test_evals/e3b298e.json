  "coverage": "Upon the azure sky where day doth fade,  \nWith hues of gold and rose the sun descends.  \nIn ev'ry ray, a whispered serenade,  \nAs night draws nigh, its gentle charm extends.  \n\nThe heavens blaze with fiery chariot bold,  \nA palette rare of crimson, orange, bright.  \nIn celestial dance doth day unfold,  \nThen yields to eve and tender cloak of night.  \n\nYon starry court shall soon adorn the sphere,  \nYet in this twilight, earth and sky embrace.  \nSuch beauty lies when day and dusk appear,  \nConjoining sky and realm in gentle space.  \n\nThus hath the sun, in splendor grand, departed,  \nAnd leaves our souls enchanted, yet uncharted.
