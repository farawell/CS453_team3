  "coverage": "In yon fair garden where the roses grow,  \nAn unseen shade envelops heart in woe.  \nFor there beneath the boughs of willow'd trees,  \nLamenting sighs are carried on the breeze.  \n\nO restless heart, ensnared by love in vain,  \nThy passions burn like fire, yet bring but pain.  \nKind Cupid's bow hath missed its mark so true,  \nAnd left thee drowning 'neath despair's cold dew.  \n\nHer visage bright, a radiant morn doth show,  \nYet careless she, whilst thou art bowed low.  \nThine ardor strong, like tempest o'er the sea,  \nYet still her eyes doth turn away from thee.  \n\nAs nightingale dost sing to dark'ning skies,  \nSo doth thy soul outpour in tearful cries.  \nDesiring much, yet by her love denied,  \nIn unmarked shadows wilt thou oft abide.  \n\nYet take thou heart; for love's sweet sting once iced,  \nOf honeyed bliss some say one reaps thrice the prize.  \nWhilst fortune's wheel doth slowly spin its round,  \nPerchance her heart to thine at last be bound.  ",
