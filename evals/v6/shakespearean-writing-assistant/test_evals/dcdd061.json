  "coverage": "Oh, treach’rous serpent, clad in fairest guise,  \nHow sweet thy poison’d arrows strike my heart!  \nFor I did place my trust in thee alone,  \nA most dear friend whose counsel seem’d divine.\n\nYet, lo! Beneath thy honey’d words doth lie  \nA dagger’s edge, unseen until too late.  \nThy promise fair, a cloak for bitter lies,  \nThat turneth daylight into darkest night.\n\nWhat foul ambition thine, to wound me so,  \nWith wolfish fang beneath a sheep’s soft wool?  \nThis dark betrayal, mark’d with cruelty’s brand,  \nHath split my soul and rent my peace asunder.\n\nI ponder now, amidst the storm of grief,  \nWhat purpose serves this treason thou hast forged?  \nThou wast a beckon’d star in night’s embrace,  \nYet now thy light doth flicker and betray.\n\nO, cursed fate that I should witness this,  \nThe breaking of all bonds that love did weave.  \nYet in the wreckage of my bruised heart’s trust,  \nDetermination doth arise anew.\n\nThrough tears and agony, resolve is born,  \nTo rise above thy perfidy’s cruel clutch.  \nI’ll walk this shadow’d path with pride restored,  \nMade wise by sorrow’s mournful, bitter tune.\n\nHenceforth, let all take heed of friendship’s guise,  \nFor ne’er canst thou be sure what mask it wears.  \nYet I, with strength and wisdom fiercely gained,  \nShall brave the world, betray’d, but unashamed.",
