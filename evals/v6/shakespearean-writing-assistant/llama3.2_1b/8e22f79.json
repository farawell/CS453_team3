  "output": "Fair sir or madam, thou dost ask,\n\nI shall entrust unto thee my soul,\nA lamentation of love's sad tale,\nIn Elizabethan meter, with stanzas whole.\n\nThy words, dear friend, doth pierce mine heart\nLike Cupid's shaft, that pierceth to the very core.\nUnrequited love, a torment most dire,\nDoth make my blood to boil and foam with fire.\n\nO, fair thought of love's sweet tender touch,\nHow oft thy absence hath made me lose my hush.\nIn dreams, I see thee smiling at my face,\nAnd wake to find thy love in empty space.\n\nThy eyes, like sapphires shining bright and blue,\nDo captivate mine heart, and make me anew.\nBut alas, thou dost not see the love I bear,\nOnly a reflection of my empty air.\n\nIn vain, I try to express my pain,\nTo weep and wail, to rend myself in twain.\nFor thy indifference doth break my soul,\nAnd with each passing day, my heart doth roll.\n\nYet still, I hope that someday thou shalt see\nThe depth of feelings that in secrecy be.",
