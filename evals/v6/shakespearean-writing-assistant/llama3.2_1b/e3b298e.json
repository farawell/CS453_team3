  "output": "Fair Sunset, thou dost paint thy sky\nWith colors bright, that do my senses cheer;\nAs day's last light doth fade away to gray,\nAnd evening's hush doth softly bring near.\n\nThe pinks of orb and setting wind do play,\nUpon thy hues, that do in dance impart;\nThe lavender tongues do whisper low,\nOf summer's fleeting breath, that did depart.\n\nThe orange fingers, o'er the clouds do sway,\nAs thou dost lead thee gently to thy sleep;\nAnd when thou findest still thy colors stay,\nThou art a peaceful haven, soft and deep.\n\nSo let me sit and watch thy beauty rare,\nAnd bask in love with thee, till night's dark air.",
