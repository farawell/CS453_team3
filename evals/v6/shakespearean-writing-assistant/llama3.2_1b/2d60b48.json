  "output": "Fair request! Here's a sonnet of gentle hue, with verse that doth celebrate the morn's awakening kiss:\nWhen morning's fiery chariot descends,\nAnd darkness flees before its radiant beam,\nThe world, in quiet slumber, finds its bliss\nIn morning's beauty, and sweet peace.\n\nThou dewy sun, that dost illume the day,\nDoth bring forth life, in vibrant colors bright,\nAs roses bloom, and all around do play\nTheir joyous delight, in morning's light.\n\nThe birds, with song, begin their merry air,\nAnd from their perches, they ascend to wings,\nTheir trills and chirps, a chorus rare,\nEchoing through the dawn's hallowed rings.\n\nThen let us bask in morning's sweet display,\nAnd gratitude our souls for this bright day.",
