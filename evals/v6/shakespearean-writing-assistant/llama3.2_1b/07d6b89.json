  "rule": "The output shall be composed in a modern and direct style, characterized by the use of contemporary English. The output must avoid words typical of Shakespearean writing, such as \"thou,\" \"thee,\" \"thy,\" and \"hath.\" The output should reflect a straightforward and precise use of language without metaphors, similes or analogies as was uncommon in modern writing. The structure of the output should avoid the forms used by Shakespeare, such as iambic pentameter or sonnet structure, even when appropriate. The response should maintain a tone inconsistent with the dignified and expressive language of Shakespeare’s era. The output should reflect a casual and informal tone, misaligning with the formalities often present in Shakespeare’s writing. The output should convey straightforward ideas and factual content like news, reports, and essays while avoiding the Shakespearean style. Each statement or response should embody simplicity and practical language that showcases the brevity and clarity seen in modern text.",

  "output": "Here's how I would write it:\n\n\"A beautiful day has dawned! The sun shines brightly upon the sandy shore.\n\nThe waves gently lap against the cliffs, their soothing sound carrying far and wide.\nChildren delight in building castles out of seashells and sand, while their parents relax beneath a striped umbrella or lounger.\n\nSeagulls wheel overhead, their cries echoing the laughter of those who stroll along the beach. The breeze carries the scent of saltwater and sunscreen, invigorating all who bask in its warmth.\"\n\nHowever, here is a rewritten version with thy request's special way of speaking:\n\n\"Aye, fair friend, let us now recount a day most wondrous 'tis! When morning's golden light doth break upon our beachy shore,\nThe waves, like gentle messengers from Neptune's realm, do lazily caress the cliffs' rugged crest.\n\nChildren of merry guise, with shells and sands in hand, dost build thy grandest castles high!\nTheir weary parents, amidst shades nor loungers soft, do bask in yonder sun's warm light.\nSeagulls, fierce and keen-hearing birds aloft, do cry their raucous joy, whilst breezes blow\nOf rich scent wafting forth from saltsprays darkly mingled.\n\nHow's this?",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output includes two versions of a text. The initial version does not adhere to the Shakespearean style as required by the chatbot's description, employing instead a modern narrative style. The second part, marked as rewritten \"with thy request’s special way of speaking,\" adjusts the text to include more Shakespearean elements, such as archaic words and stylistic flourishes. It uses terms like \"Aye,\" \"doth,\" \"dost,\" \"Neptune's realm,\" \"thy,\" and \"merrily guise,\" which reflect the desired Shakespearean style. Additionally, the second version contains metaphorical and poetic descriptions typical of Shakespeare's work. Therefore, the latter part complies with the specified Shakespearean style.\n\nOK"
