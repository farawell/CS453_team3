  "output": "Fair patron, thou seekest a love story told\nIn terms of old-fashioned eloquence, most bold.\n\n**The Tale of Two Star-Cross'd Lovers**\n\n(Act I, Scene I)\n\nIn sooth, fair Verona's streets were filled with strife,\nAs families divided by ancient grudge did thrive.\n'Twixt Montague and Capulet, two noble lines,\nA perpetual war did brew, a tale of woe divine.\n\nTheir parents' hatred for each other was a stain\nUpon the city's heart, and love's sweet flame was thrown\nInto the fiery pit of discord and ill-will;\nBut amidst the flames, two youths began to smile.\n\n**The Chorus**\n\nOh, fairest Verona, thy star-cross'd lovers did\nLong for escape from quarrelsome fate's wild thread.\nTheir hearts entwined in secret love's sweet bondage,\nAnd thus they vowed to flee the family bond.\n\n(Act II, Scene I)\n\nIn twilight's hush, where moonlight doth illume\nThe city's steps, our star-cross'd lovers did confide;\nThirteen-year-old Romeo, hawking sweet delights,\nDid charm his father's favor with his loving eyes.\n\nThirteen-year-old Juliet, fair and bright as sun,\nDid secretly meet him in the garden's gentle fun.\nTheir hearts did beat as one, their love a flame\nThat burned within them, unrelenting, wild, and free.\n\n**Romeo**\n\nO, happy day! What luck that I did meet thee,\nFair Juliet! Thou dost enthrall my noble heart!\nPray tell me, what dost thou say in secret whispers?\nShall we deceive our families, our love to realize?\n\n**Juliet**\n\nAlas, dear Romeo, fate doth not permit\nOur love to be revealed. My family doth decree\nOur wedown vows most solemnly; the moon shall hide\nThine eyes from mine.\n\n(Act III, Scene I)\n\nFive days did pass, then two, and thus our fears:\nOur families' anger knew not how to cease.\nBut in a secret chamber of our hearts so fair,\nWe vowed to flee Verona's hate-filled lair.\n\n**Juliet**\n\nOh, cruel fate! Doth the sun not seem to rise?\nShall love be extinguished by thy rage, my Romeo?\nMust we forever hide our love from prying eyes?\n\nRomeo\n\nNay, fair Juliet, do not fear; I'll be with thee,\nIn secret chambers, and in love's sweet destiny.\n\n(Act IV, Scene I)\n\nAt last we met again, beneath moonlit skies,\nAnd kissed once more the burning flame that dies.\nOur families did find each other, in a burst of rage\nThat shook the city to its foundations' age.\n\n**Tragic Clave**\n\nOh, cursed fate! Our love did seal our downfall's snare.\nWe thus departed secretly, each leaving behind\nOur homes, our families' hate; two star-cross'd lovers, free, and more.\nIn secret chambers of our hearts, we vowed to be:\nThough parted by the world above, united in love, wild, and carefree.\n\n**Epilogue**\n\nAnd thus these star-cross'd lovers' tale is told,\nOf love that conquered hatred's raging stormy fold.\nTheir hearts entwined through secret whispers and delight;\nAnd though their love was doomed from first to last, 'twas still alight.",
