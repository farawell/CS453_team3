  "validityText": "The input consists of three components. Firstly, the input appears to be structured as three separate parts, which are meant to form a paragraph consisting of sentences: \"Cities bustle with life.\", \"Streets echo stories of people.\", and \"An orchestra of human activity.\". Upon evaluating the compliance of these parts against the input specification:\n\n1. The specification mandates that the input be a paragraph containing at least three sentences. While there are three parts, only the first two are complete sentences as the third part \"An orchestra of human activity\" lacks a verb, making it a sentence fragment rather than a complete sentence.\n   \n2. The input specification also requires sentences to be complete and grammatically correct, which the third part fails in being due to the absence of a verb or predicate, making it a sentence fragment.\n\n3. Furthermore, each sentence should contain sufficient textual content for embedding at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. Given the brevity of these parts, especially the sentence fragment, there isn't enough content to apply multiple <em> tags per sentence.\n\nHence, due to the third part not being a complete and grammatically correct sentence and the insufficiency of content for tag insertion, the input does not meet the specification requirements.\n\nERR",
