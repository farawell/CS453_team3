  "validityText": "The input consists of a paragraph with three sentences: \"Rainbows are colorful.\", \"They appear after rain showers.\", and \"Kids love chasing them.\" Each sentence is complete and grammatically correct. \n\nHowever, when considering the requirement that each sentence must contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags, there seems to be an issue. Each sentence is quite short, consisting of only a few words, which might not provide ample content for the insertion of the specified tags, especially multiple <em> tags. \n\nBy the specification, each sentence should be rich enough to meaningfully insert such tags without compromising its completeness and grammatical correctness. Given the brevity and simplicity of these sentences, they lack sufficient complexity for multiple tag insertions.\n\nERR",
