  "validityText": "The given input consists of a paragraph with three sentences: \"Dreams motivate action. Passion fuels success. Believe in endless possibilities.\" To evaluate compliance with the input specification, let's consider:\n\n1. **Minimum Sentence Requirement**: The input needs to contain at least three sentences. The input provided meets this requirement as it contains exactly three sentences.\n\n2. **Grammatical Correctness**: Each sentence should be complete and grammatically correct. Upon evaluation, all three sentences are complete and grammatically correct, as they each form a complete idea and are correctly punctuated.\n\n3. **Sufficient Textual Content for Tags**: The input must contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence. The sentences in the input are short and lack complexity and structure to insert both a <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each one. For instance, the sentence \"Dreams motivate action.\" is so brief that inserting multiple <em> tags would not be feasible without disrupting the grammatical structure or meaning.\n\nGiven the limited length and simplicity of each sentence, criteria for sufficient textual content to insert a <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence is not met.\n\nERR",
