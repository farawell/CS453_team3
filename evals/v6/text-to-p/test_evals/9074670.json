However, the input does not explicitly contain sufficient textual content within each sentence to allow for the insertion of multiple <em> tags. The sentences are quite short, and while a single <strong> tag or a single <em> tag might be feasible, multiple <em> tags in each sentence may not be practical given the brevity and simplicity of the sentences involved.\n\nERR",
