  "validityText": "The input provided is a paragraph consisting of three sentences. Letâ€™s evaluate it against the input specification:\n\n1. **Number of Sentences**: The input must contain at least three sentences. The input provided has three sentences: \"The moon glows at night.\", \"Stars twinkle alongside.\", and \"A canvas of the universe.\"\n\n2. **Complete and Grammatically Correct Sentences**: Each sentence should be complete and grammatically correct. \"The moon glows at night.\" and \"Stars twinkle alongside.\" are complete and grammatically correct. However, \"A canvas of the universe.\" is a fragment lacking a verb and is not a complete sentence. Therefore, it does not comply with the specification requiring complete sentences.\n\n3. **Sufficient Textual Content**: The input should allow for inserting at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence. The short and simplistic nature of the sentences makes it difficult to naturally fit these tags meaningfully. This further suggests insufficiency in textual content for the specified requirement.\n\nConsidering the violation of the complete sentence requirement as well as the requirement for sufficient textual content for meaningful tag insertion, the input does not comply with the specification.\n\nERR",
