  "validityText": "The input is a paragraph consisting of three sentences. Each sentence is complete and grammatically correct. However, the input specification states that each sentence should contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence. The sentences provided are quite short and do not contain sufficient textual content for the insertion of the specified HTML tags without compromising the grammatical integrity. For instance, in the sentence \"Robotics is a fascinating field,\" inserting multiple <em> tags would not be feasible without violating grammatical norms, and the same issue applies to the other sentences. Therefore, the input does not satisfy the specification requiring capacity for multiple <em> and one <strong> tag per sentence.\n\nERR",
