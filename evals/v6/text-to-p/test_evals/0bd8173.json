  "validityText": "The input consists of a paragraph containing three sentences: \"Butterflies flutter by.\", \"Flowers sway in the breeze.\", and \"Nature sings a silent song.\". According to the input specification, the paragraph must contain at least three sentences. This input satisfies that requirement as it has exactly three sentences.\n\nNext, each sentence should be complete and grammatically correct. Each sentence here expresses a complete thought and is grammatically correct.\n\nLastly, the input should contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence. The sentences are quite short and do not have much complexity or additional elements, which limits the possibility of inserting multiple <em> tags in each sentence under normal circumstances without awkwardness or redundancy. The same issue arises with inserting a <strong> tag. \n\nThe ability to insert multiple <em> tags in each sentence is questionable due to the brevity and simplicity of the sentences provided. Thus, this input does not fully meet the specification regarding the textual content requirement.\n\nERR",
