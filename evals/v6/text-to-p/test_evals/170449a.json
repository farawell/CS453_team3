  "validityText": "The input provided consists of a paragraph with exactly three sentences: \"Human anatomy is complex and intricate. Each organ has a specific function. The study of anatomy aids medical knowledge.\" According to the input specification, the paragraph must contain at least three sentences, which this input meets. Each sentence appears to be complete and grammatically correct.\n\nHowever, the specification also requires that each sentence contains sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence. Each sentence in the provided input is quite short, making it challenging to insert a <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags naturally without undermining grammatical correctness or sentence completeness. \n\nTherefore, based on these observations, the input does not fully comply with the specification due to the insufficient length and complexity of each sentence to accommodate the required HTML tags.\n\nERR",
