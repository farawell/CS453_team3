  "validityText": "The provided input consists of a paragraph with three sentences, which meets the requirement of containing at least three sentences. Each sentence is complete and grammatically correct. However, for the paragraph to comply fully with the specification, each sentence should contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. Let's evaluate the possibility of insertion:\n\n1. \"Programming languages enable software creation.\" - This sentence is concise and could accommodate a <strong> tag, such as by emphasizing \"programming languages\" or \"software creation.\" It also allows for multiple <em> tags if we break down the sentence, for instance, emphasizing \"languages\" and \"creation\" separately.\n\n2. \"Each language has unique features.\" - This sentence also can accommodate a <strong> tag by highlighting \"unique features\" and <em> tags can be used on \"language\" and \"unique.\"\n\n3. \"Selecting the right one depends on the project.\" - A <strong> tag can be placed around \"right one,\" and <em> tags can be used on individual components like \"selecting\" and \"project.\"\n\nSince each sentence can reasonably accommodate the required tags, the input satisfies the condition of having sufficient textual content for the specified tag insertion.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
