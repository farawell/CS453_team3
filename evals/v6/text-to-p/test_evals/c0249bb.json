This input meets the minimum sentence requirement, as it contains exactly three sentences. Furthermore, the sentences are complete and grammatically correct, thereby fulfilling the specification requirement for grammatical correctness.\n\nHowever, the input does not comply with the requirement that the input should contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence. The given sentences are too short and lack the complexity or length necessary for the meaningful inclusion of such tags within each sentence. \n\nERR",
