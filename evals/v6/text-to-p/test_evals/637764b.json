  "validityText": "The input provided is a paragraph of text consisting of three sentences: \"Life is unpredictable.\", \"Embrace every moment.\", and \"Find joy in simplicity.\" While it does meet the minimum requirement of consisting of three sentences, each sentence is quite short and lacks complexity and depth. Moreover, each sentence does not provide sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of multiple <em> tags, as required by the input specification. Additionally, there is no content that lends itself to the insertion of a <strong> tag in each sentence. \n\nERR",
