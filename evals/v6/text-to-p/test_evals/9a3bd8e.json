  "validityText": "The input given is a paragraph consisting of three sentences. Let's evaluate it according to the specification:\n\n1. Sentence Count: The input consists of three sentences, which meets the requirement of having at least three sentences.\n\n2. Sentence Completeness and Grammar: Each sentence is complete and grammatically correct:\n   - \"Mindfulness promotes mental well-being.\"\n   - \"Meditation helps reduce stress.\"\n   - \"Positive thinking impacts overall health.\"\n\n3. Textual Content for Tags: The specification requires that each sentence must contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. The sentence length and structure seem limited and we cannot confirm that they contain enough substance to allow multiple <em> tags within each sentence. For example, allowing an insertion within \"Meditation helps reduce stress.\" is restrictive.\n\nBased on the third point, the input does not contain sufficient textual content for the required tag insertions, thus violating the specification.\n\nERR",
