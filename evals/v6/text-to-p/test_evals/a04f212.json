  "validityText": "The given input is a paragraph that contains three sentences: \"Music has a universal appeal.\", \"Different genres cater to varied tastes.\", and \"Live concerts are exhilarating.\". \n\n- Firstly, the input meets the requirement of being a paragraph containing at least three sentences.\n- Secondly, each sentence is complete and grammatically correct with a subject and a predicate, thereby satisfying the specification for grammatical correctness.\n- The third requirement is that the input should contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence. The sentences are sufficiently long and contain multiple words where such tags can potentially be inserted. \n\nFor example:\n  - Strong emphasis could be added to key concepts or nouns (e.g., <strong>Music</strong>).\n  - Emphasis tags could be added to various adjectives or adverbs (e.g., <em>universal</em>).\n\nGiven that all the aspects of the input specification are met, there is no violation of the input specification. Therefore, the input complies perfectly with the specification.\n\nOK",
