  "validityText": "The input paragraph contains exactly three sentences: \"Music has the power to heal.\", \"Notes create harmony.\", and \"Listening brings peace.\". Each sentence is grammatically correct and complete. However, the input specification requires that there should be \"sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence\". The sentences here are too brief to reasonably allow for the insertion of these tags without potentially compromising their structural integrity or intended meaning. Therefore, the input does not meet the requirement for sufficient textual content for tag insertion.\n\nERR",
