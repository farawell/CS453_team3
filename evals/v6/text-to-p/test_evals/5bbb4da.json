  "validityText": "The given input is a paragraph consisting of three sentences: \"Innovation drives progress.\", \"New ideas challenge norms.\", and \"Creativity fuels discovery.\" According to the input specification, the paragraph must contain at least three sentences, which the input does. However, the sentences need to be complete and grammatically correct, which they are. The crucial point in the specification is that each sentence must contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence.\n\nUpon closely examining the sentences, they are short and lack sufficient textual content to accommodate multiple <em> tags within each one. The <em> tag is typically used to emphasize text, suggesting there should be enough words to meaningfully apply these tags multiple times within the sentence. Given the brevity and simplicity of the sentences, it is difficult to envision inserting multiple <em> tags in a meaningful way. This aspect does not comply with the specification.\n\nERR",
