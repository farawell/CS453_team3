The first sentence, \"The snow falls silently,\" is a complete and grammatically correct sentence.\n2. The second sentence, \"Blankets of white cover the land,\" is also a complete and grammatically correct sentence.\n3. However, the third \"sentence,\" \"A peaceful winter scene,\" is a fragment and is not a complete sentence. A complete sentence should have both a subject and a predicate, whereas this fragment lacks a verb.\n\nAdditionally, the input should allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence. Considering the third \"sentence\" is a fragment, it limits opportunities for such insertions, though it is important to note that the fragment issue itself is sufficient for non-compliance. \n\nDue to the presence of a sentence fragment, the input does not meet the requirement of consisting of complete and grammatically correct sentences.\n\nERR",
