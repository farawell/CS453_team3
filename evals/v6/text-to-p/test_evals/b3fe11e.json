  "validityText": "The input paragraph contains three sentences: \n1. \"Psychology examines human behavior.\"\n2. \"It considers emotions, cognition, and motivation.\"\n3. \"Various therapies address mental health issues.\"\n\nWhile the input paragraph meets the requirement of having at least three sentences, the sentences are relatively short and simple. Each sentence is complete and grammatically correct. However, the specification also requires that the paragraph should contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence. \n\nThe brevity and simplicity of these sentences make it challenging to naturally insert a <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags into each sentence without altering the structure significantly or straining the sentence. For instance, each sentence would need to be expanded with more detail or additional information to facilitate the insertion of multiple <em> tags per sentence and at least one <strong> tag.\n\nTherefore, the input does not comply with the requirement for sufficient textual content that allows manipulation with HTML tags as specified.\n\nERR",
