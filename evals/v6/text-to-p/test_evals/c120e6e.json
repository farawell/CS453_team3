  "validityText": "The given input is a paragraph that consists of three sentences: \"Reading books is a great hobby.\", \"It improves vocabulary.\", and \"Fiction and non-fiction are both enjoyable.\" These sentences are complete and grammatically correct, therefore satisfying part of the specification. However, the input specification also requires that each sentence should contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. The sentences here are short and lack complexity, making it challenging to add multiple <em> tags within each sentence. Additionally, at least one <strong> tag must be insertable within the paragraph; with such short sentences, it is not feasible to identify parts that could logically be emphasized using these tags without further context or restructuring of sentences. \n\nERR",
