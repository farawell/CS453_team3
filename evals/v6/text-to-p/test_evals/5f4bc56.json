  "validityText": "The input specification requires a paragraph consisting of at least three complete and grammatically correct sentences. The provided input contains three sentences: \"Political science studies governance systems.\", \"It considers policy analysis and public opinion.\", and \"Democracy and authoritarianism are types of governance.\". All three sentences are complete and grammatically correct, thus satisfying the requirement for sentence completeness and grammatical correctness.\n\nHowever, the specification also requires that each sentence contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. In the given input, the sentences are short, limiting the number of <em> tags that can be inserted without disrupting grammatical correctness or the natural flow of each sentence. It is quite challenging to insert multiple <em> tags into these sentences given their brevity, thus not meeting the requirement for tag insertion capability.\n\nERR",
