  "validityText": "The input consists of a paragraph of text which includes three sentences: \"Gardens bloom in spring.\", \"Colors burst into view.\", and \"Life renews itself naturally.\" Each sentence is complete and grammatically correct. However, when assessing against the part of the specification that mentions the necessity for sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence, the input fails to comply. The sentences are too brief and lack the complexity or sufficient content to credibly accommodate the insertion of multiple HTML tags as specified. There is simply not enough content in each sentence for such modifications without altering the integrity of the sentences.\n\nERR",
