  "validityText": "The input text consists of a paragraph with three sentences: \"Oceanography explores marine environments.\", \"The vast oceans are full of life.\", and \"Conservation efforts protect marine biodiversity.\". The input specification requires that each paragraph contains at least three sentences, which is satisfied here. However, the sentences must also be complete, grammatically correct, and contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence. \n\nWhile all three sentences are grammatically correct and complete, they are quite short and lack complex structure or additional descriptive elements that would naturally allow for the insertion of multiple <em> tags within each sentence. The sentences are concise and do not provide enough content to reasonably insert multiple <em> tags. Therefore, the requirement for having \"sufficient textual content\" for multiple <em> tags is not met.\n\nERR",
