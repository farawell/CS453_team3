  "validityText": "The input provided is a paragraph consisting of three sentences: \"Mathematics is foundational to many disciplines.\", \"It offers tools for problem-solving.\", and \"Algebra and calculus are fundamental branches.\" Each sentence is complete and grammatically correct, satisfying the first part of the input specification. However, the input specification requires each sentence to contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. \n\nIn the given sentences, the textual content is minimal and concentrated around specific key ideas (e.g., \"Mathematics\", \"tools for problem-solving\", \"Algebra and calculus\"). These words or short phrases may allow placement of one or two <em> tags but do not provide enough content to insert multiple <em> tags in each sentence, as required by the specification. Additionally, there is no evident opportunity to insert a <strong> tag in each sentence while maintaining its grammatical correctness and coherence, as the specification requires an allowance for such insertion.\n\nTherefore, the input does not comply with the specification as it does not adequately allow for the insertion of multiple <em> tags in each sentence and at least one <strong> tag throughout.\n\nERR",
