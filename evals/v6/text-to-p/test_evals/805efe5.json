  "validityText": "The input consists of three sentences: \"Technology evolves swiftly.\", \"Gadgets connect people globally.\", and \"Innovation shapes the future.\". Each of these sentences is complete and grammatically correct, complying with the sentence structure requirements. However, the specification requires that each sentence should allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags, indicating a need for sufficient textual content within each sentence. The sentences are very concise, with limited content, making it challenging to insert multiple <em> tags without overly fragmenting the structure or meaning of the sentences. Specifically, the brevity and simplicity of the sentences leave minimal room for meaningful emphasis and strong text formatting using tags, as required by the specification.\n\nERR",
