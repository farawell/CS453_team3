  "validityText": "The input consists of a paragraph containing three sentences: \"Nutrition impacts health significantly.\", \"Balanced diets support well-being.\", and \"Macronutrients and micronutrients are essential.\". Each sentence is grammatically correct and complete. However, the sentences do not contain enough textual content to allow for the insertion of multiple <em> tags within each sentence. The content is very minimal, which limits the possible insertion points for multiple <em> tags within each sentence. This does not meet the requirement that there should be sufficient textual content for multiple <em> tags in each sentence. \n\nERR",
