  "validityText": "The given input consists of three sentences. However, upon examination, the third sentence \"Exciting to watch.\" is not a complete sentence as it lacks a subject and verb; it's a fragment. According to the input specification, sentences should be complete and grammatically correct, which means they must have a subject and a verb. Additionally, there isn't enough textual content in each of these sentences to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence. These issues lead me to conclude that the input does not comply with the input specification.\n\nERR",
