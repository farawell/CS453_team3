  "validityText": "The input text is a paragraph consisting of three sentences: \n1. \"Language is a powerful communication tool.\"\n2. \"It varies across cultures and communities.\"\n3. \"Linguistics studies language structure and evolution.\"\n\nEach sentence is complete and grammatically correct. The paragraph contains at least three sentences, which meets the initial requirement of the input specification. However, the specification also requires that each sentence should contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. \n\nExamining each sentence:\n1. The first sentence has only five words, limiting opportunities for inserting both <strong> and multiple <em> tags meaningfully.\n2. The second sentence is similarly brief with seven words.\n3. The third sentence offers slightly more content but is still quite brief, with seven words.\n\nOverall, these sentences do not provide enough content for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence as required by the specification. Thus, the input does not comply with the requirements for tag placement in each sentence.\n\nERR",
