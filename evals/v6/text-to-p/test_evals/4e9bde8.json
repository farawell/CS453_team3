  "validityText": "The input is a paragraph of text containing three sentences, which meets the specification's requirement of having at least three sentences. Next, each sentence is complete and appears grammatically correct. However, the specification requires that each sentence should have sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. In this input:\n\n1. \"Artificial intelligence is transforming industries.\" – This sentence is very short, making it challenging to insert multiple <em> tags without redundancy or altering the meaning. It’s unlikely to find multiple valid parts of the sentence to emphasize separately.\n\n2. \"Machine learning models analyze data.\" – This sentence also lacks enough content. It consists of only five words, offering limited opportunities to place multiple <em> tags.\n\n3. \"Automation is becoming more common.\" – This sentence, like the others, is limited in content and length, making it hard to insert multiple <em> tags appropriately.\n\nOverall, each sentence in the paragraph fails to contain the necessary richness or depth to satisfy the requirement for multiple <em> tags within each one.\n\nERR",
