  "validityText": "The input contains a paragraph with three sentences:\n1. \"Astronomy explores celestial bodies.\"\n2. \"Telescopes reveal distant galaxies.\"\n3. \"Space missions expand our understanding.\"\n\nEach sentence is complete and grammatically correct, fulfilling the requirement for complete sentences. The paragraph consists of exactly three sentences, meeting the specification for the minimum number of sentences required.\n\nHowever, upon evaluating the input, I noticed that each sentence is very concise and does not contain sufficient textual content to insert at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags within each sentence. This violates the part of the specification that requires sentences to have sufficient content for such tags.\n\nERR",
