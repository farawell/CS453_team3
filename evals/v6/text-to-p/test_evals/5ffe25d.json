Each sentence appears to be complete and grammatically correct. \n3. However, each sentence does not contain sufficient textual content for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. The sentences are too brief to allow for significant modification using these tags in a meaningful way.\n\nGiven the constraint about the sufficiency of textual content for tagging, the input fails to meet this specific requirement.\n\nERR",
