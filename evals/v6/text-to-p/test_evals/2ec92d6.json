  "validityText": "The input consists of three sentences, which meets the requirement of having at least three sentences. However, let's analyze the sentences individually:\n\n1. \"Programming is fun.\" - This is a complete and grammatically correct sentence. However, it is very short, making it challenging to insert multiple <em> tags and at least one <strong> tag within the sentence. \n\n2. \"It challenges your mind.\" - Similarly, this is a complete sentence, but it is also short in length. It would be difficult to incorporate multiple <em> tags and one <strong> tag without disrupting the grammatical structure of the sentence.\n\n3. \"Solve problems creatively.\" - This sentence is an imperative sentence and is grammatically correct. Nevertheless, it is short and does not provide ample textual content to insert multiple <em> tags and at least one <strong> tag adequately.\n\nThe input specification requires that each sentence should contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. All three sentences in the provided input are too brief to meet this requirement, as they lack the necessary length and complexity to insert such tags without affecting grammatical correctness.\n\nERR",
