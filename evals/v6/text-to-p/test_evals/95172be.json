  "validityText": "The input provided is a paragraph of text consisting of three sentences. Let's evaluate this against the input specification:\n\n1. **Paragraph containing at least three sentences**: The input clearly contains three sentences: \"Books transport you to different worlds.\", \"They are windows to knowledge.\", and \"Reading is a powerful tool.\" Hence, this part complies with the specification.\n\n2. **Complete and grammatically correct sentences**: Each sentence is both complete and grammatically correct. The subject and verb agreement is intact, and there are no obvious grammatical errors.\n\n3. **Sufficient textual content for <strong> and <em> tag insertion**: In terms of textual content, each sentence is concise but contains enough elements to allow for simple emphasis through `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, though the specification does not provide explicit criteria on what quantifies as \"sufficient\" for these tags. For example, tags could be applied to words like \"Books\", \"different worlds\", \"windows\", \"knowledge\", \"Reading\", and \"powerful tool\".\n\nGiven these considerations, the input complies with all elements of the input specification.\n\nOK",
