  "validityText": "The provided input is a paragraph of text that consists of three sentences. Here's my evaluation based on the input specification:\n\n1. **Paragraph Requirement**: The input is required to be a paragraph containing at least three sentences. The input meets this criterion as it consists of exactly three complete sentences.\n\n2. **Complete and Grammatically Correct Sentences**: Each sentence in the input is complete and grammatically correct. The sentences are well-structured and convey clear ideas regarding renewable energy sources, solar and wind power, and their potential to reduce pollution.\n\n3. **Textual Content for Tag Insertion**: According to the specification, the input should contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags within each sentence. \n   \n   - Sentence 1: \"Renewable energy sources are vital.\" is too short to contain multiple `<em>` tags and a `<strong>` tag while maintaining clarity and meaning.\n   \n   - Sentence 2: \"Solar and wind power are sustainable.\" is also quite short and may not provide sufficient content for multiple `<em>` tags and a `<strong>` tag.\n   \n   - Sentence 3: \"These alternatives can reduce pollution.\" lacks the complexity or length required for such tag insertion.\n\nBased on the requirement for sufficient content to allow for multiple `<em>` tags and at least one `<strong>` tag in each sentence, the input fails to comply. The sentences are too short and lack the necessary complexity to fulfill this specification. \n\nERR",
