  "validityText": "The given input is a paragraph consisting of exactly three sentences. Each sentence is complete and grammatically correct. However, according to the input specification, each sentence should contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags within each sentence. \n\n1. The first sentence \"Photography captures moments in time.\" is quite short and doesn't provide enough content for multiple `<em>` tags. \n2. The second sentence \"It is both an art and a science.\" is also brief and may struggle to incorporate multiple `<em>` tags effectively due to its conciseness.\n3. The third sentence \"Digital cameras offer versatility.\" is again short and lacks the needed content for inserting multiple `<em>` tags.\n\nThe input specification requires that there be sufficient textual content in each sentence for inserting these tags, and the shortness of each sentence implies non-compliance with this part of the specification.\n\nERR",
