  "validityText": "The input consists of three sentences: \"Software development is a creative process.\", \"It involves writing code to solve problems.\", and \"Debugging is often necessary.\". Each sentence is complete and grammatically correct, thus satisfying the first part of the specification. However, each sentence is quite short, and it is necessary to evaluate whether each sentence has \"sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags.\" The sentences provided are relatively short and might not have sufficient content to naturally and meaningfully accommodate both a <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within the same sentence, especially given the concise nature of these sentences. This lack of length or complexity to support such tag insertions is a violation of the requirements. Therefore, the input does not comply with the specification as it does not fully allow for the insertion of the specified tags.\n\nERR",
