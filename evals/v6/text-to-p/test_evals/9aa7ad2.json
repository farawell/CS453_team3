  "validityText": "The input paragraph contains three sentences: \"Exercise is crucial for maintaining health.\", \"Cardiovascular activities strengthen the heart.\", and \"Strength training builds muscles.\". Each of these sentences is complete and grammatically correct, fulfilling the requirement of containing at least three sentences. However, the input also needs to provide enough textual content within each sentence to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. \n\nAnalyzing the sentence structure:\n1. \"Exercise is crucial for maintaining health.\" - This sentence has limited content, making it challenging to insert multiple <em> tags without disrupting readability.\n2. \"Cardiovascular activities strengthen the heart.\" - Similar to the first sentence, the short structure limits the feasibility of inserting multiple <em> tags.\n3. \"Strength training builds muscles.\" - This sentence is also quite succinct, posing the same challenge for tag insertion.\n\nThe input provides complete sentences but does not fulfill the requirement of having sufficient textual content within each sentence for multiple <em> tags and at least one <strong> tag. \n\nERR",
