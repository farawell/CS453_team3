  "validityText": "The provided input is a paragraph consisting of three sentences. The sentences are complete and grammatically correct, meeting the requirement for the text to contain at least three sentences. However, the input specification requires that each sentence should have sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. \n\n- First sentence: \"The sun shines brightly today.\" This sentence is quite short and might not have sufficient content to add multiple <em> tags. Therefore, it does not comply with the specification of allowing for multiple <em> tags.\n\n- Second sentence: \"Birds are chirping everywhere.\" Like the first sentence, this sentence is also short and concise, similar issues regarding the placement of multiple <em> tags arise.\n\n- Third sentence: \"It is a perfect day for a walk.\" This is a bit longer than the first two, but still, it might be challenging to distribute multiple <em> tags without making the sentence awkward.\n\nIn summary, although the grammatical structure and the number of sentences are compliant with the specified requirements, the input fails the condition of having sufficient textual content in each sentence for inserting multiple <em> tags.\n\nERR",
