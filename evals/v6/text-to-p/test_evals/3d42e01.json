  "validityText": "The given input is a paragraph containing three sentences: \"Sociology examines societies and interactions.\", \"It considers social structures and institutions.\", and \"Cultural norms shape behavior.\". These sentences are complete and grammatically correct, satisfying the first part of the input specification regarding sentence completeness and grammatical correctness. However, the specification also requires that each sentence allows for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. The sentences provided are quite short and do not contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of those tags while maintaining a meaningful sentence structure. Because of this lack of sufficient textual content in each sentence, the input does not meet the specification requirement for insertion of tags. Thus, the input does not comply with the input specification.\n\nERR",
