  "validityText": "The given input is a paragraph consisting of three distinct sentences:\n\n1. \"Business studies organizational operations.\"\n2. \"It considers management, marketing, and finance.\"\n3. \"Strategic planning guides business growth.\"\n\n1. Upon evaluating the paragraph against the provided input specification, each sentence appears to be complete and contains correct grammar. As per the specification requirements, the input indeed consists of at least three sentences, fulfilling the minimum quantity requirement.\n\n2. The third component of the specification includes the stipulation for there to be sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags within each sentence. Each sentence within this input is rather short and lacks the breadth or complexity of content typically needed to accommodate multiple `<em>` tags suitably, let alone one `<strong>` tag within each sentence.\n\nGiven these points, the input does not meet the inclusivity requirement regarding having enough content for the specified HTML tags properly.\n\nERR",
