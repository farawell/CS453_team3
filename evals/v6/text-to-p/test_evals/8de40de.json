  "validityText": "The given input is a paragraph with three sentences:\n\n1. \"Engineering applies scientific principles.\"\n2. \"It designs solutions to technical challenges.\"\n3. \"Civil, mechanical, and electrical are major branches.\"\n\nLet's evaluate the input according to the input specification:\n\n- The paragraph indeed contains at least three sentences as required.\n- The sentences seem to have complete thought and do not have obvious grammatical errors.\n- For the part about containing sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence, the sentences in this input are relatively short and concise, which makes inserting multiple <em> tags per sentence challenging without altering the meaning or fluency. This suggests insufficient textual content for the specified tag insertion requirements.\n\nBased on this analysis, while the input meets the sentence number and grammatical correctness criteria, it violates the specification requiring sufficient textual content within sentences for multiple <em> tags, as the sentences are too brief to naturally accommodate this requirement.\n\nERR",
