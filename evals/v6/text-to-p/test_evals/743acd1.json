Each sentence appears to be complete and grammatically correct:\n1. \"Climate change is an urgent issue.\"\n2. \"Renewable energy sources are gaining attention.\"\n3. \"Conservation efforts are essential.\" \n\nHowever, the specification also requires that the input contains sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence. The sentences provided are very brief and do not contain enough textual content to reasonably accommodate these HTML tags in a meaningful way, particularly the requirement for \"multiple <em> tags within each sentence\" seems difficult to fulfill considering the brevity of the sentences.\n\nERR",
