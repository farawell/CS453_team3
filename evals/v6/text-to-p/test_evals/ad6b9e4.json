  "validityText": "The input consists of three sentences: \"The mountains are tall.\", \"Rivers flow with grace.\", and \"Nature is mesmerizing.\". Each sentence is complete and grammatically correct, meeting that part of the specification. However, the input specification requires that each sentence contain enough textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. The sentences provided are too short and lack sufficient complexity for these tags to be meaningfully inserted. For example, in the sentence \"The mountains are tall.\", it is difficult to insert a <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags without altering the sentence structure or meaning significantly. Therefore, the input does not comply with the specification.\n\nERR",
