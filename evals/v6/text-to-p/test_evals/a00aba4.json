  "coverage": "```html\n<p><strong>Geology</strong> <em>studies</em> the <em>Earth</em>.</p>\n<p>It <em>examines</em> <em>rocks</em>, <strong>minerals</strong>, and <em>landforms</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Plate tectonics</strong> explains the <em>movement</em> of <em>continents</em>.</p>\n```",
  "validityText": "The input consists of a paragraph with three sentences: \"Geology studies the Earth.\", \"It examines rocks, minerals, and landforms.\", and \"Plate tectonics explains the movement of continents.\" Each of these sentences is grammatically correct and complete, satisfying the requirement of having at least three sentences in the paragraph. \n\nHowever, the second part of the specification states that there should be enough textual content in each sentence to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags. Each sentence should be substantial enough to allow this kind of HTML tagging without becoming awkward or losing its integrity. The sentences in this input are fairly short, which might limit the ability to insert multiple <em> tags within each sentence while maintaining grammatical and semantic integrity, especially when considering the brevity of some sentences.\n\nFor example, in the sentence \"Geology studies the Earth.\", inserting a <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags could be challenging without making it convoluted or losing its brief nature. Similarly, the other sentences, though a bit longer, might still face issues with supporting \"multiple\" emphasis tags effectively. \n\nTherefore, the input appears to not fully comply with the requirement that each sentence should contain sufficient textual content for such tagging.\n\nERR",
