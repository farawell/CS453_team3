  "validityText": "The input provided consists of a paragraph with three sentences: \"Winter brings snow.\", \"Cozy fires warm the evenings.\", and \"Hot cocoa comforts the soul.\". \n\nAccording to the input specification, the input must be a paragraph containing at least three sentences. The provided input does indeed have three sentences, so it meets this part of the specification. Additionally, each sentence must be complete and grammatically correct. All three sentences are complete and grammatically correct. \n\nHowever, the specification also requires that there should be sufficient textual content in the paragraph to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence. The input sentences are very short and simplistic. There might not be enough content in each sentence to justify the insertion of multiple <em> tags in each or a <strong> tag, as they lack complexity or additional context. Therefore, the input does not seem to allow for this level of HTML tag insertion, violating the specification.\n\nERR",
