  "validityText": "The input consists of a paragraph of text that contains three sentences, meeting the minimum sentence requirement. Each sentence is complete and grammatically correct. \n\nAnalyzing the textual content for compliance, the paragraph provides sentences that are too brief and concise. The specification requires that the input should contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of a <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence. Given the succinct nature of these sentences, there isn't enough content in each to feasibly insert both a <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags without disrupting the sentence structure or meaning.\n\nHence, the input text does not contain sufficient complexity or length in each sentence to comply with the specification regarding the insertion of formatting tags.\n\nERR",
