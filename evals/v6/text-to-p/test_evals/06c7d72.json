  "validityText": "The input consists of a paragraph containing three sentences: \"Birds chirp in the morning. They signal a fresh start. It's a joy to hear.\" This meets the criteria of being a paragraph with at least three sentences.\n\nHowever, upon examining the requirement that sentences should contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence, the input falls short. Each sentence is too concise to accommodate such tags without disrupting the structure of the sentences or making them awkward. Therefore, the input does not satisfy the specification regarding the length and complexity needed for proper tag insertion.\n\nERR",
