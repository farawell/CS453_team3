  "validityText": "The input provided consists of three separate sentences: \"Bridges connect places.\", \"They symbolize unity and collaboration.\", and \"Engineering marvels.\". To comply with the input specification, each sentence should be complete and grammatically correct. Upon evaluation, the sentence \"Engineering marvels.\" is not a complete sentence as it lacks a verb and is more of a sentence fragment. The input specification explicitly requires complete sentences. \n\nMoreover, the specification requires sentences to contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence. The provided sentences are too brief to accommodate such tags effectively within each sentence.\n\nERR",
