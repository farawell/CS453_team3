  "coverage": "```html\n<p>The <strong>animal</strong> kingdom is <em>diverse</em>.</p>\n<p>Each <strong>species</strong> plays a role <em>in</em> its <em>ecosystem</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Conservation</strong> efforts are <em>crucial</em> for <em>protection</em>.</p>\n```",
  "validityText": "The input given is a paragraph consisting of exactly three sentences, which meets the minimum requirement of the input specification. Each of these sentences is complete and grammatically correct:\n\n1. \"The animal kingdom is diverse.\"\n2. \"Each species plays a role in its ecosystem.\"\n3. \"Conservation efforts are crucial for protection.\"\n\nHowever, the input specification requires the paragraph to contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence. Examining the content:\n\n- Sentence 1 (\"The animal kingdom is diverse.\") is too short to meaningfully contain more than one <em> tag or a <strong> tag without potentially making the sentence awkward or affecting its grammatical integrity.\n- Sentence 2 (\"Each species plays a role in its ecosystem.\") is limited in content for multiple <em> tags, although some manipulation could allow for one. However, again, adding a <strong> tag along with multiple <em> tags while maintaining clarity may be challenging.\n- Sentence 3 (\"Conservation efforts are crucial for protection.\") might allow for a <strong> tag and possibly one or two <em> tags, but it stretches the content efficiently without making the sentence complex enough for the requirements.\n\nOverall, while the paragraph technically meets the sentence quantity specification, it lacks \"sufficient textual content\" for the insertion of the required <strong> and multiple <em> tags in each sentence without disrupting the sentence structure or meaning, which is a necessary requirement as per the input specification. \n\nERR",
