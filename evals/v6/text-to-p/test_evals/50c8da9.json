  "validityText": "Upon evaluating the given input, let's verify its compliance with the input specification:\n\n1. **Paragraph Requirement**: The input must be a paragraph. A paragraph typically consists of multiple sentences grouped together to convey a single idea or theme. The input indeed looks like a paragraph as it contains multiple sentences.\n\n2. **Sentence Requirement**: The input must contain at least three sentences. The given input consists of three sentences: \"This is a beautiful day.\", \"We've never seen such weather.\", and \"Amazing to experience.\" It satisfies the requirement for the number of sentences.\n\n3. **Grammatical Completeness**: The sentences should be complete and grammatically correct. The first two sentences (\"This is a beautiful day.\" and \"We've never seen such weather.\") are complete and grammatically correct. However, the third sentence \"Amazing to experience.\" is a fragment and lacks a subject and verb, making it grammatically incomplete.\n\n4. **Sufficient Content for Tags**: Each sentence should have sufficient content to allow for the insertion of at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags. The third sentence is too short and does not provide sufficient content for such tag insertions.\n\nBecause the third sentence is grammatically incomplete and does not allow for multiple tag insertions, the input does not meet the input specification. \n\nERR",
