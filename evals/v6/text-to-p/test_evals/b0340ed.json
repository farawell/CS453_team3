  "validityText": "The input consists of three sentences: \"Social media connects people worldwide.\", \"It is a platform for sharing information.\", and \"Privacy concerns are rising.\" Each of these sentences is grammatically correct and complete. The paragraph does consist of at least three sentences, satisfying the requirement for multiple sentences. However, the input specification requires the paragraph to contain sufficient textual content to allow for the insertion of at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each sentence. Each sentence here is relatively short and simple, and it would be challenging to insert multiple <em> tags or a <strong> tag without disrupting the minimal content present. Therefore, the input does not comply with the specification because it does not have enough textual content in each sentence to fulfill the requirement for the insertion of multiple tags. \n\nERR",
