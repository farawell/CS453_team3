It <em>improves</em> <em>vocabulary</em>. Fiction and non-fiction are both <em>enjoyable</em>.</p>\n  ```\n  - Although this `<p>` tag does contain a `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, it does not comply with the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.

Instead, they wrap single words or phrases improperly, which makes it unclear if there are at least three proper sentences each one inside a separate <p> tag.\n\n3. **Formatting Directly Inside <p> Tags**: \n   - Although there are <strong> and <em> tags used within sentences, the requirement that each entire sentence should be wrapped by <p> tags first is not adhered to consistently. \n\n4. **Presence of <strong> and <em> Tags**: \n   - While the text does include <strong> tags and multiple <em> tags for emphasis within parts of the text, the surrounding <p> tags do not correctly encapsulate entire sentences as required.\n\nDue to these violations of the chatbot description, particularly in terms of incorrect <p> tag usage, the output does not adhere to the requirements specified.\n\nERR",
