The output must wrap each sentence with a <p> tag, which it seems to do since there are three <p> tags present.\n\n2. Inside each <p> tag, there should be at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases. However, the following issues are present: \n   - In the first <p> tag, there is an incorrect usage of <em> in `<em-analyzes</em>`. This is not a valid HTML tag format. It should be `<em>` and `</em>`.\n   - In the second <p> tag, there are incorrect usages of <em> and <strong> in `<em-considering</em>` and `<strong-supply</strong>`. Again, these are not valid HTML tag formats.\n   - In the third <p> tag, there is an incorrect usage in `<em-policies</em>`.\n\nThese incorrect usages of HTML tags break the compliance with the requirement of using <em> and <strong> tags correctly within each <p> tag.\n\nERR"
