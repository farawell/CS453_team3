  "compliance": "err",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output primarily complies with the given description, but there are a couple of points to consider: \n\n1. **Number of <p> tags**: The output contains more than three <p> tags, which is compliant with the requirement of having at least three <p> tags. \n\n2. **Use of <strong> and <em> tags**: Within the <p> tags, there are multiple <strong> tags that highlight key phrases or words, as required. However, there are some instances where the <strong> tags appear outside the sentences wrapped within <p> tags (e.g., **<p><strong>Text:</strong></p>**). This may not strictly follow the requirement to wrap each sentence with a <strong> tag inside of the <p> tags. \n\n3. **Emphasis with <em> tags**: The output does utilize <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases, which aligns with the guidelines.\n\n4. **Sentences within <p> tags**: All sentences within the <p> tags contain proper structure, and many have the additionally required <strong> and <em> tags.\n\nThe main concern is the placement and structure concerning the <strong> tags and their relationship to the sentences. Since the guideline requires each sentence within a <p> tag (containing a <strong> tag), and the structure is not consistently following that normative pattern, there is partial non-compliance.\n\nERR"
