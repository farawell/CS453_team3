Both of these <p> tags also include multiple <em> tags, which further complies with the guidelines.\n\nHowever, the third <p> tag does not have any <strong> or <em> tags applied to any keywords or phrases. This violates the requirement that each <p> tag must have one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags.
