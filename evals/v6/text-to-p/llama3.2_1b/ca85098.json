  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output violates several key instructions in the description:\n\n1. The output must have at least three `<p>` tags. In the provided output, there is no evidence of `<p>` tags correctly surrounding individual sentences. The tag `< p >` appears once and is incorrectly formed, and there are no additional uses of `<p>` tags, which implies non-compliance with the requirement for at least three `<p>` tags.\n\n2. Sentences are not separated into individual `<p>` tags, which is a requirement specified in the description that each sentence should be separately wrapped with a `<p>` tag.\n\n3. There are improper and incorrect usage of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags. Within the example:\n   - `<lt;/ strong&gt;` and `&lt;/ strong&gt;` are not properly formed HTML closing tags.\n   - `</ em/&gt;` is also an incorrect syntax for an HTML tag. \n   These indicate improper syntax and usage of the required HTML tags for emphasizing text.\n\nConsidering the points above, the output does not comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
