The rules state to first split the paragraph into individual sentences and then wrap each sentence with a `<p>` tag. Currently, each `<p>` tag contains multiple sentences.\n2. The output includes `<span>` tags, which are not mentioned in the chatbot's description. The task specifies using `<strong>` and `<em>` tags for emphasis within the `<p>` tags. There are no `<strong>` or `<em>` tags present at all.\n3. The description asks for the use of multiple `<em>` tags within the `<p>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases, which is also not present in the output.\n\nERR"
