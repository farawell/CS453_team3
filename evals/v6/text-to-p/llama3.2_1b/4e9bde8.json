  "complianceText": "The chatbot output fails to meet several key requirements outlined in the description:\n\n1. **Proper Structuring of Sentences**: The output should consist of multiple sentences, each wrapped within its own `<p>` tag. While there are several `<p>` tags, the sentences are not properly segregated into distinct paragraphs, leading to incomplete and fragmented sentence structures.\n\n2. **Use of Tags**: Each `<p>` tag should include at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words or phrases. Although the output contains both `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, they are often used incorrectly. For example, in one instance, `<em '>'models'(<strong>'</strong)>` is not a valid HTML structure. There are misplaced or incorrectly nested tags, such as `(<em>'common&#x002F;.<strong>'</em>)` and `<strong>(<a href=\"\" class=' external'><em>lt</em><a>/</a>)`.\n\n3. **Well-formed HTML**: The HTML provided must be well-formed. The given output contains numerous tag mismatches, missing closing tags, and invalid syntax, preventing it from being well-formed HTML. For example, `<strong>Artificial<i>and<i>ificial<i>is</i><em>(</em>)` is incorrect and not valid.\n\nThese violations indicate non-compliance with the chatbot's task of formatting text paragraphs properly with HTML tags, particularly focusing on clarity, structure, and syntactical correctness.\n\nERR"
