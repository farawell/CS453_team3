Therefore, it does not comply with the requirement for a minimum number of tags.\n\n2. The usage of tags inside `<p>` elements is inconsistent and incorrect:\n    - In the first `<p>` tag: The use of the `<strong>` tag is correct, but the intended **peculiar** is written with `**` instead of `<strong>`.\n    - In the second `<p>` tag: The `<strong>` tag has a matching issue, attempting to close it with `**`.\n\nAs the output does not meet the minimum number of `<p>` tags and has incorrect HTML formatting, it violates the guidelines set by the description.\n\nERR"
