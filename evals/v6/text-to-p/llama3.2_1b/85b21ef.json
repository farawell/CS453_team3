  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description provided. The description instructs to format a paragraph of text by splitting it into individual sentences and wrapping each sentence with a <p> tag. The output provided seems to have more than what could be accurately described as just individual sentences.\n\n1. **At least Three <p> Tags**: While there are multiple <p> tags present, only a few appear to contain a full sentence. Several <p> tags contain only single words or fragments, which do not contribute to a full sentence. The tags should wrap entire sentences, not fragments or single words.\n\n2. **Use of <strong> and <em> Tags**: The description specifies the use of one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each <p> tag. While the output uses these tags, it does not adhere to the rule of having only one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags within each complete sentence wrapped in a <p> tag.\n\n3. **Lack of complete sentences**: Many <p> tags have only partial sentences or words, signifying that the chatbot likely did not split the input text correctly into full individual sentences. Each <p> tag should encompass a complete sentence, not fragments or isolated words.\n\nDue to these reasons, the output does not meet the expectations set forth in the description.\n\nERR"
