  "complianceText": "The given output showcases significant deviations from the required format according to the description provided:\n\n1. The description mandates that the text should be broken into individual sentences, each wrapped with a <p> tag. However, the output does not consistently follow this rule; there are embedded tags and entire sections that are not enclosed in <p> tags.\n\n2. The description requires the inclusion of at least three <p> tags. This output contains at least two identifiable <p> tags, but not the minimum of three as required.\n\n3. Each sentence inside a <p> tag requires at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases. While there are some uses of <strong> and <em> tags, the output is inconsistent, and not every sentence complies with this structure.\n\nDue to these reasons, the chatbot output fails to comply with the description and thus does not properly follow the requirements. \n\nERR"
