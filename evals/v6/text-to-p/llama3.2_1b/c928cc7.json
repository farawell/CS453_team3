  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the description for the following reasons:\n\n1. The description requires each sentence in the paragraph to be wrapped with a `<p>` tag, and the text provided should have at least three `<p>` tags. In the output, only two `<p>` tags are present. Therefore, it violates this rule by not having the minimum required number of `<p>` tags.\n\n2. The output does not have any `<strong>` or `<em>` tags within the `<p>` tags. Instead, it improperly uses `<span strong>` tags outside of the `<p>` tags. This structure does not comply with the requirement that at least one `<strong>` tag should be inside each `<p>` tag.\n\nThese clear non-compliances with the instructions make the output deviate from the specified format described. \n\nERR"
