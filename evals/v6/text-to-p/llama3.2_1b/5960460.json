However, in the output, multiple sentences are enclosed within a single `<p>` tag. Specifically:\n\n1. The first `<p>` tag contains three sentences: \"Sunrises inspire hope,\" \"The horizon changes hue,\" and \"Each dawn is unique.\" They should each be wrapped in their own `<p>` tags.\n2. The second `<p>` tag also encloses the same three sentences.\n3. The third `<p>` tag contains three sentences: \"Ambient lighting often surrounds the sky during sunrise,\" \"The haze can appear at dawn, altering the scene,\" and \"This phenomenon makes each moment special.\"\n\nThough the output does include at least three `<p>` tags, it does not comply with the guideline that each sentence should be wrapped in its own `<p>` tag.\n\nERR"
