Split the paragraph into individual sentences, wrapping each sentence in a `<p>` tag.\n2. Contain at least three `<p>` tags.\n3. Inside each `<p>` tag, include one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags for emphasizing key words and phrases.\n\nUpon reviewing the output:\n\n1. The output indeed contains more than three `<p>` tags.\n2. The first `<p>` tag contains a `<strong>` tag but no `<em>` tags, which does not fully comply with the instruction to have multiple `<em>` tags in every `<p>` tag.\n3. The second `<p>` tag does not contain a `<strong>` tag, which is also a non-compliance with the requirement to include one `<strong>` tag in each `<p>` tag.\n4. The third `<p>` tag contains a `<strong>` tag but does not have any `<em>` tags, again not meeting the requirement to have multiple `<em>` tags.\n\nThus, the output violates the compliance rules and does not meet the specified format criteria.\n\nERR"
