  "complianceText": "Upon evaluation of the output, the following points have been identified:\n\n1. **Tag Structure**: The output contains improperly nested tags. Specifically, there are `<p>` tags placed inside other `<p>` tags, which violates correct HTML formatting practice. Each sentence should be uniquely wrapped in a single `<p>` tag.\n\n2. **Number of Sentences**: According to the description, each sentence should be wrapped in its own `<p>` tag, and there should be at least three such `<p>` tags. The structure provided does not meet this requirement since it contains only two outer `<p>` tags, and the inner `<p>` tags are incorrectly nested and not counted separately.\n\n3. **<strong> and <em> Tags**: The output contains only one `<strong>` tag and no `<em>` tags within the paragraphs, while the description states that each sentence should contain one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. This requirement is not met.\n\nDue to these violations, specifically the incorrect nesting of `<p>` tags, the insufficient number of `<p>` tags, and the lack of `<em>` tags, the output does not comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
