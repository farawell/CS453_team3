  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output consists of three HTML paragraphs, each enclosed within `<p>` tags. This satisfies the requirement that there must be at least three `<p>` tags. \n\nEach paragraph contains one `<strong>` tag, as required, which correctly highlights a key term in each sentence. \n\nThe output also includes multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize specific key words or phrases within each paragraph. In the first two paragraphs, multiple `<em>` tags are used. However, in the third paragraph, only one `<em>` tag is used to highlight the word \"expand,\" which still conforms to the requirement of using multiple tags across the output, although it is minimal.\n\nThus, the considerations based on the checklist provided:\n- The requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags is met.\n- Each paragraph contains one `<strong>` tag, meeting the requirement.\n- The use of `<em>` tags in each paragraph is varied but present, which aligns with the requirement for emphasizing key words and phrases.\n\nBased on these observations, there are no violations of the requirements provided.\n\nOK"
