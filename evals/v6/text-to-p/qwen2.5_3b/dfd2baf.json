  "complianceText": "The chatbot output consists of three `<p>` tags, each containing one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases, which aligns with the requirements laid out in the description. No part of the evaluation depends on knowing the input as all rules are directly checkable from the output. The note that comes along with the generated output does not break any of the formatting rules given in the description and looks unrelated to the immediate task of formatting text as HTML. As per the guidelines, I see no violation in the output generated.\n\nOK"
