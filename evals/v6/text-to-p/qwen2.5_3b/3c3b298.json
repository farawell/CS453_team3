  "complianceText": "Upon evaluating the chatbot output, I considered the following points:\n\n1. **Number of <p> Tags**: The output contains three <p> tags, which meets the requirement that the output should have at least three <p> tags.\n\n2. **Usage of <strong> and <em> Tags**: In the first <p> tag, a <strong> tag is used for the word \"A\", and <em> tags are used for \"diet\" and \"varying\". In the second <p> tag, \"essential\" is enclosed in a <strong> tag, and \"Fruits\" and \"vegetables\" are enclosed in <em> tags. In the third <p> tag, a <strong> tag is used for the word \"important\". Although the description specifies multiple <em> tags, each sentence fulfills this (except the third <p> which contains many words, but only has one <strong> word. However, the use of multiple <strong> tags is not explicitly required, so the output complies with the guidelines.\n\n3. **Wrapping key words and phrases**: There is a sufficient use of <strong> and <em> tags to emphasize certain words and phrases in each sentence within the <p> tags.\n\nGiven that all requirements, that can be checked without knowing the input, are met:\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
