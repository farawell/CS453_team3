Each paragraph contains one `<strong>` tag as well as multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases, adhering to the instructions in the description. \n\nFirst `<p>` tag: Contains one `<strong>` tag emphasizing \"Stars\" and an `<em>` tag emphasizing \"brightly.\"\n\nSecond `<p>` tag: Contains one `<strong>` tag emphasizing \"They\" and two `<em>` tags emphasizing \"night\" and \"sky.\"\n\nThird `<p>` tag: Contains one `<strong>` tag emphasizing \"Stargazing\" and an `<em>` tag emphasizing \"relaxing.\"\n\nEach sentence is also wrapped in its own paragraph tag, which aligns with the guideline to split the paragraph into individual sentences, though verification of how many sentences exist in the original text is not possible without the input. Based on these observations, there are no violations in terms of the rules that can be checked without the input.\n\nOK"
