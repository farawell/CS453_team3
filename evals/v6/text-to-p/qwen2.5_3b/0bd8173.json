  "complianceText": "The output consists of three paragraph tags: `<p><strong>Butterflies</strong> flutter by.</p>`, `<p><em>Flowers</em> sway in the breeze.</p>`, and `<p>Nature sings a <strong>silent</strong> song.</p>`. This satisfies the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n\nInside the <p> tags:\n1. The first paragraph contains a `<strong>` tag around \"Butterflies\".\n2. The second paragraph contains an `<em>` tag around \"Flowers\".\n3. The third paragraph contains a `<strong>` tag around \"silent\".\n\nHowever, it lacks a crucial part of the description: inside each `<p>` tag, there should be one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags. The second and third paragraphs do not contain both `<strong>` and `<em>` tags. In the second paragraph, there is no `<strong>` tag, and in the third paragraph, there is no `<em>` tag.\n\nERR"
