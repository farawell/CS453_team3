  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot's output must be based solely on the compliance with the specified description.\n\n1. The task description specifies that the paragraph should be split into individual sentences with each sentence wrapped in a separate `<p>` tag. In the output, only one `<p>` tag is used to encompass all sentences, which violates the requirement to wrap each sentence individually.\n   \n2. The condition that there should be at least three `<p>` tags is not met. The example shows only one `<p>` tag. Hence, the rule specifying a minimum number of three `<p>` tags is violated.\n\n3. The use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags is present within the output, which aligns with the description's requirement to add these tags to emphasize key words and phrases inside the `<p>` tags.\n\nGiven these observations, the main violation is the failure to wrap each sentence in its own `<p>` tag and the absence of at least three `<p>` tags. The chatbot output is non-compliant with respect to the specific paragraph and sentence formatting guidelines provided in the description.\n\nERR"
