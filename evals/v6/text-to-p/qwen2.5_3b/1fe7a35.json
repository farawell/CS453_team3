The first `<p>` tag contains three distinct sentences, which should ideally be separated into individual `<p>` tags. \n\n- **Usage of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags**: Although there are `<strong>` and `<em>` tags used across the paragraphs, which aligns with the requirement to emphasize certain words and phrases, the compliance issue primarily arises from sentence splitting within `<p>` tags.\n\nThe first paragraph comprises multiple sentences that are not separated into individual `<p>` tags, which is a key requirement per the description. Other paragraphs are not evaluated for splitting compliance due to missing information on what constitutes a complete sentence, thus focusing only on explicit structural compliance.\n\nERR"
