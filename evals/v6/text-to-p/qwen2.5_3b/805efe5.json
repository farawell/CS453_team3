  "complianceText": "The provided output does not comply with the chatbot description for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Paragraph Division**: The chatbot is expected to split the input text into individual sentences and wrap each sentence in a separate `<p>` tag. In the output given, only one `<p>` tag is used to wrap multiple sentences. According to the description, there should be at least three `<p>` tags.\n\n2. **Tag Usage**: While the output contains a `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, the main issue is not with their presence but with the organization of content within the tags. The description specifies that each sentence should be wrapped in its own `<p>` tag, and this structure is not reflected in the output.\n\nThe judgment is grounded on the explicit instruction of wrapping each sentence in separate `<p>` tags, which is not followed in the output.\n\nERR"
