  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output contains three `<p>` tags, which aligns with the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags. Each `<p>` tag is supposed to contain one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags for emphasizing key words and phrases. \n\n- The first paragraph `<p><strong>Summer</strong> days are long.</p>` contains a `<strong>` tag but no `<em>` tags. This is a violation as each paragraph should have multiple `<em>` tags.\n- The second paragraph `<p><em>sunsets</em> are beautiful.</p>` contains an `<em>` tag but no `<strong>` tag. This is another violation since each paragraph should have at least one `<strong>` tag.\n- The third paragraph `<p>Beaches invite <em>relaxation</em>.</p>` contains an `<em>` tag but no `<strong>` tag, similar to the second paragraph.\n\nThus, not every paragraph contains both a `<strong>` and at least one `<em>` tag, leading to non-compliance with the description. \n\nERR"
