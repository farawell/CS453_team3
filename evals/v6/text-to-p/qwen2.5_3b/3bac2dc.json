  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot output shows the following issues:\n\n1. Each sentence should be wrapped in a single `<p>` tag, yet the output wraps each word in a separate `<p>` tag instead of one `<p>` tag per sentence. \n\n2. The description requires each sentence within the `<p>` tag to include one `<strong>` and multiple `<em>` tags for key words and phrases. However, the output does not comply with this rule since each `<p>` tag contains only one word and therefore does not demonstrate the use of both `<strong>` and `<em>` within the same `<p>` tag as required.\n\nBased on these elements, the generated HTML does not fit the format specified in the description, as it fails on sentence grouping and tag usage within each `<p>` element. Thus, it violates the chatbot's description.\n\nERR"
