According to the description, the paragraph should be split into individual sentences, and each sentence must be wrapped with a `<p>` tag.

The first `<p>` tag contains a `<strong>` tag for \"HTML\" and another for \"structure,\" and it includes one `<em>` tag for \"It\" and another for \"CSS.\" However, it is unclear if it contains individual sentences as the instruction requires.\n   \n2. The second `<p>` tag seems to be a repetition of the first paragraph but without consistent `<strong>` tags as required.\n   \nOverall, the output should have at least three `<p>` tags, and each should include at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags. The provided output only contains two `<p>` tags which indicate non-compliance with the rule of having at least three `<p>` tags. \n\nERR"
