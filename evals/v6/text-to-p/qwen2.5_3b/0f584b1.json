Each sentence is properly wrapped with a `<p>` tag. \n\nHowever, the implementation of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags doesn't fully comply with the description:\n1. The description requires adding one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag to emphasize key words and phrases. In the provided output, the entire content within each `<p>` tag is wrapped in both `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, instead of using these tags on specific words or phrases for emphasis.\n \nTherefore, the output does not fully comply with the description, as it does not effectively use `<strong>` and `<em>` tags to emphasize individual key words and phrases within each sentence.\n\nERR"
