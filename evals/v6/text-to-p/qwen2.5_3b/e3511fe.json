However, the content within each <p> tag is identical, which may be a violation depending on whether it reflects different sentences from the input or not. Since the input is not provided, I will ignore this aspect. \n\nEach <p> tag includes exactly one <strong> tag, as required. There are also multiple <em> tags within each <p> tag, complying with the guideline to emphasize key words and phrases using <em> tags.\n\nSince there is no explicit rule in the description that states the content within each <p> tag must be unique without knowing the input, and all explicit formatting requirements are adhered to, the output complies with the description based on the given rules. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
