Additionally, each `<p>` tag should include one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. \n\nWhile the output correctly includes three `<p>` tags, ensuring compliance with the requirement to have at least three, only one `<em>` tag is present in each `<p>` which violates the condition of multiple `<em>` tags being used. The guideline specifies the use of multiple `<em>` tags, but each sentence in the output provided only has one `<em>` tag.\n\nERR"
