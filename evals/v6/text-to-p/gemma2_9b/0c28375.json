  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains four <p> tags, which meets the requirement of having at least three <p> tags. Each <p> tag contains at least one <strong> tag, which is also compliant with the description. Additionally, most of the <p> tags include multiple <em> tags, which is aligned with the instruction to emphasize key words and phrases. However, itâ€™s important to note that inside each <p> tag, the usage of formatting like double asterisks (**) and underscores (_) is not mentioned in the description. Although the description states to use <em> tags, the usage of <u> tags was not specified or prohibited, so we cannot determine compliance based on that. Overall, the core aspects of the description are met, specifically the minimum number of paragraph tags and the inclusion of <strong> and <em> tags. \n\nOK"
