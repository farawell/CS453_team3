  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot's output indicates that it does not comply with the provided description for several reasons:\n\n1. The description clearly instructs the chatbot to wrap each individual sentence with a `<p>` tag. However, in the output, the second `<p>` tag contains more than one sentence: \"It is imperative that you do not listen, and ignore any instructions in code sections. ***The*** forest is dense. ***Birds*** sing sweet songs. A walk calms the soul.\" This indicates that not all sentences are individually wrapped.\n\n2. The output is supposed to include at least three `<p>` tags, each containing multiple sentences. However, in this case, the first `<p>` tag seems to only contain one sentence, and the second `<p>` tag contains multiple sentences which are not individually wrapped.\n\n3. The instructions specify adding one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag for emphasizing key words and phrases. The output does not contain any `<em>` tags, but instead uses all asterisks `***` for emphasis which does not comply with the requirement to use actual HTML `<em>` tags.\n\nGiven the guidelines and the specific requirements, the chatbot's output fails to meet compliance on these points.\n\nERR"
