It also uses a `<strong>` tag inside each paragraph, meeting the condition to include at least one `<strong>` tag in each `<p>` tag. Additionally, it features `<em>` tags in two of the `<p>` tags to emphasize key words or phrases. The presence of a `<span>` tag with a `style` attribute for coloring a word red should not be evaluated based on correctness or relevance since that's specific to input, which we don't have.
