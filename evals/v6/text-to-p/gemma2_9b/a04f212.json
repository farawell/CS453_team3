This is a clear violation of the requirement for the minimum number of <p> tags.\n\n2. **Use of <strong> and <em> Tags**: While <strong> and <em> tags are used within the <p> tags, due to the absence of the input text, I cannot verify whether the keywords are correctly emphasized. However, the presence of these tags where possible suggests a partial compliance in this aspect.\n\nBased on the non-compliance regarding the number of <p> tags, the decision is 'ERR'.\n\nERR"
