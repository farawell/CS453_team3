These create a bolder text style.\n* **<em> tags:** Key terms and phrases within sentences (\"Earth,\" \"rocks,\" \"minerals,\" \"continents,\" \"Plate tectonics\") are highlighted using the `<em>` tag.  They produce an italicized style.\n\n\n\nThis formatting helps to guide the reader's attention to crucial information and make the text more easily digestible.",
