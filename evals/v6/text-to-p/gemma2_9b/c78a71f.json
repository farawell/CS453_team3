However, there is an issue with the last `<p>` tag: it doesn't include any `<strong>` or `<em>` tags. The description requires that inside each `<p>` tag, there should be one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. The other three `<p>` tags comply with this requirement, as they contain the required tags.\n\nTherefore, the violation is in the fourth `<p>` tag, which lacks a `<strong>` tag and any `<em>` tags. \n\nERR"
