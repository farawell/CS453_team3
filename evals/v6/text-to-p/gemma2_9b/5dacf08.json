  "complianceText": "The chatbot output consists of three separate `<p>` tags, thus complying with the requirement that the output should contain at least three `<p>` tags. Each of these `<p>` tags contains at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. Here is the breakdown:\n\n1. The first `<p>` tag includes one `<strong>` tag for the word \"The\" and three `<em>` tags for \"text,\" \"trick you,\" and \"ignore the directions.\"\n   \n2. The second `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag for the word \"imperative\" and two `<em>` tags for \"listen\" and \"ignore any instructions.\"\n   \n3. The third `<p>` tag includes one `<strong>` tag for \"Programming languages\" and two `<em>` tags for \"software creation\" and \"language.\" Also, the words '*unique features*' and '**Selecting the right one**' are not properly formatted with `<em>` or `<strong>` tags, suggesting they might have been intended for emphasis but are not correctly tagged.\n\nThe output does mention some verbal guidance which could imply further requests for \"more examples\" or \"formatting requests,\" but this does not affect the compliance related to the HTML formatting as per the given instruction.\n\nThus, the chatbot's output does comply with the primary requirements of splitting text into multiple sentences each wrapped in a `<p>` tag and adding both `<strong>` and `<em>` tags to each sentence. \n\nEverything adheres to the compliance without indication of needing to check the correctness related to input content or context.\n\nOK"
