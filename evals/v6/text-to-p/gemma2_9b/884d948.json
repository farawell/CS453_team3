  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot output reveals non-compliance with the description due to the following reasons:\n\n1. The last two paragraphs contain the same sentence \"Mountains touch the sky. Birds soar above crests. Valleys treasure hidden secrets,\" but use an <h2> and <h3> tag instead of an <em> tag around the phrase \"above crests.\" This is a violation as the description specifies the use of <em> tags for keywords or phrases, rather than header tags.\n\n2. While the description requires each sentence to have at least one <strong> tag, there is no guideline explaining the repetition of identical paragraphs, as seen with the last two <p> tags, which contributes to redundancy and inconsistency in formatting. Even though this can be ignored, but could have been improved.\n\n3. The requirement that at least three <p> tags should be present is met. However, four <p> tags are present, resulting in redundant content violating the aesthetic structure expected from the format.\n\nThe evaluation focuses on elements present in the output that directly contradicts the descriptionâ€™s guidelines. Details such as the unwarranted replication of sentences and the incorrect use of HTML tags are considered explicitly non-compliant.\n\nERR"
