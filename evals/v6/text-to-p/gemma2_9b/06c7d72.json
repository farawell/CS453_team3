  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the provided output is as follows:\n\n- The description requires at least three `<p>` tags. The output contains four `<p>` tags, which satisfies the requirement of having at least three.\n\n- Each `<p>` tag in the output wraps individual sentences. The exact splitting into sentences is input dependent, so we cannot evaluate correctness on that aspect without knowing the input. \n\n- The description requires at least one `<strong>` tag within each `<p>` tag. Each paragraph in the output contains one `<strong>` tag, meeting the requirement.\n\n- The description also requires multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize keywords and phrases within the `<p>` tags. Each `<p>` tag contains `<em>` tags, fulfilling this part of the requirement.\n\n- There is nothing in the description limiting the number of sentences per `<p>` tag or stating that `<p>` tags must contain entirely unique content. Hence, the fourth `<p>` tag, which duplicates the third one, does not violate any explicit instructions.\n\nThe output complies with the description by including at least three `<p>` tags, each containing a `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags. No additional rules are violated.\n\nOK"
