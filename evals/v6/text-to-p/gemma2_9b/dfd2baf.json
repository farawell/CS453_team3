HTML tags were not correctly utilized for styling, as bold (**are**) and italic (*chirping*, *perfect*, *walk*) syntax from Markdown is present.\n\nThere is a clear violation in the use of Markdown instead of HTML within the output, which does not comply with the requirement to use <strong> and <em> HTML tags exclusively. Due to this specific issue, the output is non-compliant.\n\nERR"
