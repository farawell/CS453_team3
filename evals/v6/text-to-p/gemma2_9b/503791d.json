The output provided wraps individual sentences within `<p>` tags.\n\n2. **Minimum <p> Tags**: The description specifies that the output should have at least three `<p>` tags. The output presented contains five `<p>` tags, which is compliant with the requirement.\n\n3. **Use of <strong> and <em> Tags**: Each `<p>` tag should contain at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags for emphasizing key phrases. The output correctly implements this by having at least one `<strong>` tag and one or more `<em>` tags in each `<p>` block.\n\nSince the chatbot output meets all the specified requirements detailed in the description (without requiring input context), it is compliant. \n\nOK"
