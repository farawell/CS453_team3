The requirements are to format the given paragraph as HTML, splitting it into individual sentences, wrapping each sentence with a `<p>` tag, and including at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag. \n\nLet's analyze the output step by step:\n\n1. **Splitting into Sentences and Wrapping with `<p>` Tags**: \n   - The output shows that the paragraph has been split into three sentences, each enclosed within its own `<p>` tag. This satisfies the requirement to split the paragraph into individual sentences and wrap each with a `<p>` tag.\n\n2. **Usage of `<strong>` Tags**: \n   - In each `<p>` tag, there is one `<strong>` tag used, which meets the requirement to add at least one `<strong>` tag inside each `<p>` tag.\n\n3. **Usage of `<em>` Tags**: \n   - Each `<p>` tag contains multiple `<em>` tags, which fulfills the requirement to have multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag.\n\nOverall, the output is compliant with the description provided. The requirements of splitting the text into sentences, using `<p>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>` tags as described in the task have been met, and there are at least three `<p>` tags as specified.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
