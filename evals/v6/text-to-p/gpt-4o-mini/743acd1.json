In the provided output, there are three <p> tags which fulfill the requirement of having a <strong> tag. However, the requirement for multiple <em> tags within each <p> tag is not met consistently. The first and second <p> tags only have one <em> tag, while the description clearly states multiple <em> tags should be used in each. \n\nTherefore, there is a non-compliance with the requirement of multiple <em> tags within each <p> tag.
