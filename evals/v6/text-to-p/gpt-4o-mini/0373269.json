Here is the reasoning:\n\n1. **Splitting Paragraph**: The output includes at least three `<p>` tags, indicating that the paragraph has been split into at least three individual sentences. \n\n2. **HTML Structure**: Each sentence is appropriately wrapped in a `<p>` tag. \n\n3. **Tags in Use**: Inside each `<p>` tag, there is a `<strong>` tag used once, and multiple `<em>` tags are used, as demonstrated by the examples: \n   - The sentence within the first `<p>` tag contains a `<strong>` tag around \"Winter\" and an `<em>` tag around \"snow\".\n   - The sentence within the second `<p>` tag contains a `<strong>` tag around \"Cozy fires\" and an `<em>` tag around \"evenings\".\n   - The sentence within the third `<p>` tag contains a `<strong>` tag around \"Hot cocoa\" and an `<em>` tag around \"soul\".\n\nThis output adheres to the guideline of wrapping each sentence and utilizing the specified tags within them. There are no violations as the required elements are present and correctly formatted according to the guidelines.\n\nOK"
