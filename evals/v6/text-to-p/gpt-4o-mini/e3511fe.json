The output introduces a `<strong>` tag in each `<p>` tag, which is consistent with the requirement to use one `<strong>` tag per sentence. Additionally, each sentence contains multiple `<em>` tags, fulfilling the need for key words or phrases to be emphasized. Thus, the output adheres to the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags and appropriately uses the `<strong>` and `<em>` tags within each. \n\nNo violations are detected based on the description provided, which does not require evaluation of additional content not included in this output.\n\nOK"
