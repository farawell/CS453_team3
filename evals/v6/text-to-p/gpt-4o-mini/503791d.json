There are at least three `<p>` tags in the output, which satisfies the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags. Additionally, within each `<p>` tag, there is one `<strong>` tag, corresponding to an emphasized key word, and multiple `<em>` tags, which are used to emphasize additional key words or phrases. The description does not require any specific content for these tags, so the presence is sufficient for compliance. There are no instructions being violated, and overall the chatbot's output matches the formatting requirements specified in the description.\n\nOK"
