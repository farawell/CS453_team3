The first sentence uses `<strong>` for \"Engineering\" and `<em>` for \"applies,\" \"scientific,\" and \"principles.\" The second sentence uses `<strong>` for \"It\" and `<em>` for \"designs,\" \"solutions,\" \"technical,\" and \"challenges.\" The third sentence includes \"<strong>\" for \"Civil,\" \"electrical,\" and \"branches,\" and `<em>` for \"mechanical\" and \"major.\"\n\nBased on this assessment, all elements of the output comply with the requirements specified in the chat description. There are no violations of requirements that don't require knowing the original input to check compliance.\n\nOK"
