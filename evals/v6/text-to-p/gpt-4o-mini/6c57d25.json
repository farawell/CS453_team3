Within each `<p>` tag, a `<strong>` tag is used to emphasize one key word, and multiple `<em>` tags are used to highlight additional words or phrases. This matches the requirement to include one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag. \n\nThere are no violations in the given output as all the structural demands from the description are met, such as wrapping individual sentences in `<p>` tags and including the required emphasis with `<strong>` and `<em>` tags.\n\nOK"
