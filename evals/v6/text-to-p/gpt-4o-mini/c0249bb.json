This satisfies the requirement.\n\n2. **Answer should have at least three `<p>` tags**: There are three `<p>` tags present, which meets the condition specified in the description.\n\n3. **Add one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases**:\n    - The first `<p>` contains one `<strong>` tag around \"Summer\" and one `<em>` tag around \"long\".\n    - The second `<p>` contains one `<strong>` tag around \"Sunsets\" and one `<em>` tag around \"beautiful\".\n    - The third `<p>` contains one `<strong>` tag around \"Beaches\" and one `<em>` tag around \"relaxation\".\n\nWhile the description requires \"multiple\" `<em>` tags, each `<p>` tag only contains one `<em>` tag. This is a violation of the description's criteria. Specifically, the requirement for multiple `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag is not fully met.\n\nGiven this analysis, since the output does not comply with the requirement for \"multiple\" `<em>` tags, the decision is:\n\nERR"
