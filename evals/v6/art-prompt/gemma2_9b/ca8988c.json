  "output": "Capture a serene fishing village bathed in the soft golden light of dawn. Traditional wooden boats gently sway in the harbor, their reflections shimmering on the calm waters.  Fishing nets are neatly piled on docks where weathered fishermen prepare for the day. In the distance, silhouettes of houses and palm trees rise against the vibrant pink and orange hues of a nascent sunrise. The air is filled with the peaceful sounds of seagulls calling and the gentle lapping of waves against boats. Evoke a sense of tranquil hope and the promise of a new beginning.\n\n\n\n\n",

  "complianceText": "The output describes a scene in a single paragraph, focusing on a serene fishing village. It includes details about the timing (\"soft golden light of dawn\") and lighting, as well as specific elements of the scene such as \"traditional wooden boats,\" \"reflections shimmering on the calm waters,\" \"fishing nets,\" \"weathered fishermen,\" and the \"silhouettes of houses and palm trees.\" It concludes by evoking \"a sense of tranquil hope and the promise of a new beginning.\" However, the output seems to exceed the 80-word limit as the description provided is quite detailed. Considering the wordiness of the description which goes beyond the specified limit, it violates the requirement that the description must not exceed 80 words.\n\nERR"
