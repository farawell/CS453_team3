  "output": "A joyous family of four enjoys a vibrant picnic on a sun-drenched meadow. The father and mother smile lovingly as their two children, a boy and girl, giggle while building a tower of bread and cheese on a checkered blanket laid out on the lush green grass. Wildflowers in shades of purple, yellow, and pink sway gently in the warm summer breeze, adding to the idyllic scene. Sunlight filters through the leaves of a nearby oak tree, casting playful shadows across the picnic spread.  The image should evoke feelings of warmth, happiness, and simple familial joy.   \n\n\n",
