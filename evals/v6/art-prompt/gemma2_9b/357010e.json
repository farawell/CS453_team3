  "output": "Deep in a mist-shrouded valley, an age-old manor stands silhouetted against a bruised twilight sky. Cobblestones leading up to the grand oak doors are swallowed by creeping fog, revealing only glimpses of moss-covered stone walls and leaded windows that glow with an eerie amber light within. The air hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, casting a sense of foreboding mystery. Through swirling eddies of fog, bats flit across the barren trees lining the drive, their shadows elongated by the waning moon.  The scene evokes a chilling yet alluring sense of forgotten secrets and slumbering peril.   \n\n\n\n",

  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the chatbot description for several reasons. Firstly, the description exceeds the 80-word limit specified in the guidelines. This description is detailed and articulate but goes beyond the word count. Secondly, the description is written in multiple sentences, whereas it is supposed to be crafted as a single paragraph with the provided information structured as a complete entity. Although the text does include details about the background, timing, and lighting, as well as the emotions intended to be evoked, the fundamental requirements of word count and paragraph structure are not adhered to.\n\nERR"
