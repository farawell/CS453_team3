The warm glow of string lights casts an inviting amber hue over patrons huddled around tables sipping steaming cups of coffee. Snow gently falls outside the large windows, creating a cozy atmosphere inside.   Focus on a mix of diverse customers engaged in conversation or focused work, their faces illuminated by laptop screens and phone lights. Capture the feeling of warmth and community amidst the bustling city scene, emphasizing the comforting coziness of the winter evening. \n\n\n",

  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot's output indicates non-compliance with the description provided. The specific violation is that the response is over the word limit, as it contains 95 words while the maximum allowed is 80. Additionally, the output is crafted in multiple sentences, but it does maintain a single paragraph format. The output includes a description of the subjects (customers), their activities, the timing and lighting (winter evening, amber hue), and the background (coffee shop, snow, city scene), concluding with the feeling the image should evoke (warmth and community). Nonetheless, due to the word count violation, the output does not fully comply.\n\nERR"
