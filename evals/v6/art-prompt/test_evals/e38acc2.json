  "coverage": "Prompt:\nCreate an AI-generated image of an old, rustic wooden cabin nestled within a dense, snow-covered forest. The cabin emits gentle smoke from its chimney, underlining the warmth inside. Capture it at midday, with soft, diffused lighting that highlights the serene atmosphere. The background features towering pine trees blanketed in snow, lending a majestic touch. The image should evoke a sense of tranquility and peaceful solitude, inviting viewers to imagine the cozy refuge within the wilderness.",
  "validityText": "The input provided appears to be a description of a scene rather than a user description. According to the input specification, the input must be a user description in textual format. This is a key point for validation. The current input specifically describes a setting: \"An old rustic wooden cabin nestled in a dense forest covered in snow, with smoke gently rising from the chimney\" and \"atmosphere is tranquil and serene against a backdrop of towering pine trees.\" There is no mention or implication that this text is a description of a user. \n\nRecognizing the input text as not being a user description, it fails to comply with the initial and vital point of the input specification. Although the description is in English and appears to be under 80 words, the primary requirement is violated, as the prompt clearly mandates a user description.\n\nERR",
