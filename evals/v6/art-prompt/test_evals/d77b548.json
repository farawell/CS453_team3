  "input": "Serene beach scene with waves and distant mountains.",
  "coverage": "Prompt:\nCapture a serene beach scene featuring gentle waves rhythmically caressing the shore. Highlight distant, majestic mountains under a breathtaking dusk sky with hues of pink and orange. The lighting casts a soft, warm glow over the tranquil sea. The background should show a vast, open ocean merging seamlessly with the base of the mountains. The image should evoke a sense of peace and endless wonder, emphasizing the harmony between the ocean and the mountains.",
  "validityText": "The input \"Serene beach scene with waves and distant mountains.\" does not appear to be a user description but rather a description of a scene or setting. There are a few reasons to consider for this decision:\n1. The input does not describe a person or provide information about a user, which might be inferred as a requirement for a \"user description.\"\n2. The input is in English, and it is concise, containing only seven words, therefore satisfying the non-length criterion of the specifications.\n3. However, there is no specification explicitly stating that the input needs to describe a user, so this reason is based on an inferred requirement rather than one directly stated in the specification. Without a clear rule break, the closest conclusion is alignment as the specification doesn't provide more detail on what constitutes a \"user description.\"\n\nERR",
