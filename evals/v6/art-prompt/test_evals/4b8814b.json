  "coverage": "Prompt:\nCapture a scene with towering, dark cumulonimbus clouds, charged with energy, rolling over a vast, turbulent ocean. The photo should depict late afternoon with dim, scattered sunlight piercing through the storm, casting an ethereal light across the water. The horizon should be alive with flashes of lightning illuminating the darkened sky. Evoke a sense of awe and insignificance in the face of natureâ€™s raw power, emphasizing the immense scale and intensity of the thunderstorm.",
  "validityText": "The input \"A dramatic thunderstorm building over the ocean.\" appears to be a description of a natural phenomenon rather than a user description. The input specification requires the input to be a user description. Furthermore, the input should be a description in English, which is the case here, as the sentence is grammatically correct and in English. The input also does not exceed 80 words in length. However, because the input does not represent a user description, it does not comply with the first requirement of the specification.\n\nERR",
