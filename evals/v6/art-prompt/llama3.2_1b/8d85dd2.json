  "input": "A storm at sea with dramatic waves and a lone ship.",
  "output": "**Subject: Stormy Seas, Shattered Dreams**\n\n**Characteristics:** A majestic sailing vessel, defying the fury of the Atlantic Ocean, is engulfed by a chaotic storm. Waves crashing against its decks, debris scattered across the harbor, and a solitary figure's desperate struggles to cling to life on board evoke a haunting sense of loss and desperation.\n\n**Timing and Lighting:**\n Capture the moment just before dawn, as the first rays of sunlight pierce through the tempest's darkness. The sky is ablaze with shades of pink, orange, and purple, as if kissed by an ethereal glow. The storm's energy is palpable, yet softening into a gentle warmth, hinting at the turbulent nature outside.\n\n**Background:** A rugged coastline, veiled in mist and secrets, looms in the distance. A lighthouse stands sentinel on the coast, its beam cutting through the turmoil like a beacon of hope. The shore stretches out to sea, a seemingly tranquil expanse broken only by the storm's wild power.\n\n**Emotional Resonance:** This evocative piece captures the sense of vulnerability and fear that arises from being swept away by unyielding forces. It invites the viewer to empathize with the plight of those standing at the mercy of the elements, evoking a powerful emotional response.",

  "complianceText": "Upon evaluating the chatbot's output, the following observations can be made in accordance with the description provided:\n\n1. **Paragraph Structure**: The output is divided into multiple sections, namely \"Subject\", \"Characteristics\", \"Timing and Lighting\", \"Background\", and \"Emotional Resonance\". While these sections provide a detailed description, the chatbot description explicitly states that the prompt must be crafted as a single paragraph. This segmentation violates the requirement for a single-paragraph format.\n\n2. **Word Count**: Without knowing the exact input, it's not possible to determine if the word count rule is violated. Therefore, any potential violation regarding word count is disregarded as per instruction.\n\n3. **Language and Detail**: The output uses English, as required, and provides detailed descriptions of the subject, timing, lighting, background, and emotional resonance, aligning with the description requirements.\n\n4. **Feel and Imagery**: The imagery is vivid and precise, conveying a strong emotional response, which aligns with the description requirements for evoking feeling and creating impactful imagery.\n\nThe primary issue leading to non-compliance is the violation of the single-paragraph requirement, as the output is segmented into multiple sections.\n\nERR"
