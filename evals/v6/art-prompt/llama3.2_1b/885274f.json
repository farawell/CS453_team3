The forest floor, a canvas of frosty emerald, stretches out before this darkened specter like an unyielding, moonlit expanse. A faint mist shrouds the trees, as if nature itself is veiling secrets within its icy depths.\"",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is a single paragraph that describes a scene in detail. It focuses on a subject, \"a lone figure\" and mentions its characteristic as a \"silhouette\". The timing and lighting are vividly portrayed with mentions of \"the full moon's silver glow\" and a \"night where snowflakes dance\". The background is described detailing \"the forest floor\" and \"a faint mist shrouds the trees\". However, the description exceeds the 80-word limit, which is a clear violation of the guideline. Also, there's no explicit conveyance of the feeling the image should evoke, which is another requirement according to the description.\n\nERR"
