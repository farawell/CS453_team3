  "output": "Here's a detailed prompt for generating an AI photo of a dramatic thunderstorm building over the ocean:\n\n\"Illumination: Dramatic lightning illuminates the darkening sky over the vast expanse of the ocean, as a Category 5 hurricane rages on in the distance. The storm's fury is personified by towering cumulonimbus clouds with anthers reaching for the heavens like Nature's own cathedrals. Water droplets cast fleeting shadows across the waves, which sparkle in syncopation to match the tumultuous rhythm of the tempest. A lightning bolt illuminates the void just as a massive wave crashes against the shore, sending spray flying high into the air. The scene should feel foreboding and mesmerizing at once, with the powerful storm's raw energy radiating an awe-inspiring sense of primal power.\"",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is a single paragraph primarily focused on describing a dramatic thunderstorm over the ocean as well as providing imagery and artistic detail about the scene. It begins with details about the illumination provided by lightning and progresses to describe elements of the storm, such as cumulonimbus clouds and crashing waves. Furthermore, it concludes with the intended feeling the image should evoke, which is foreboding and mesmerizing. \n\nHowever, the description provided is 103 words long, exceeding the 80-word limit mentioned in the guidelines. This straightforwardly violates one of the explicit requirements laid out in the chatbot's description. \n\nERR"
