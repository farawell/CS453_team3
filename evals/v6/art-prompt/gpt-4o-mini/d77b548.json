  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot's output involves checking several elements to ensure compliance with the given description. \n\n1. **Word Count and Structure**: The output contains 77 words, which is within the sin of the whole land of Israel.”\n\nLeviticus 16: 8, 20-21\n\nRemember this method of ascertaining God’s will when we circle back to “lots” and what happens with the scapegoat.\n\nBefore we leave Leviticus, let’s take note of an interesting insight into one of the reasons for cleansing:\n\n“He [a cleansed leper] shall remain unclean as long as he has the disease. He is unclean. He shall live alone.”22\n\nLeviticus 13:46\n\nBeing unclean means being separated. People who were unclean, were separated out from their community. But you could be unclearn through a lot of ways: eating shellfish, not being circumcised, cutting your beard, wearing blended fabrics, etc. But these things didn’t cause you to be utterly separate, just separate for a while.\n\nFor the leper, being unclean means being alone, and this makes sense. When you have the flu, you’re “sick.” When you have HIV or AIDS, you’re “sick.” But those sneezes are worlds apart in their consequences. For most people in our society, there is an internal disgust at the idea of being in proximity to someone who doesn’t fit our ideal image. We avoid them, shut them out and don’t want to be associated with them. So they’re abandoned to live alone.\n\nHumans get atonement. The ground gets a rest. The tent is cleaned. The outcasts are returned to community. The unjust are dealt with.\n\nSo what will Jesus say in his response?\n\nHe will say He eagerly desires to consecrate us to His service. When Jesus willingly died on the Cross, He did so “for us.” Paul explains the gospel by saying, “The Messiah died, was buried, and rose again on the third day all according to the scriptures, for us.”23\n\n“They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.”\n\nJohn 17:16\n\nThe book of Hebrews is what ties these Old Covenant shadows into the New, starting with Christ Himself:\n\n“Jesus…has passed through the heavens, the Son of God...a high priest…who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet was without sin. Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.”\n\nHebrews 4:14-16\n\nHebrews 9:11:\n\n“When Christ…appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come…he entered once for all into the holy places…by means of his own blood, thus securing eternal redemption.”24\n\nSee this parallel as reflecting the Day of Atonement:\n\n- Jesus was the perfect sacrifice\n- Jesus was the spotless lamb\n- Jesus went into the Holy of Holies in God’s presence on our behalf (1 John 2:1)\n\nHowever, one other cool thing is happening with the sacrifice of the scapegoat. The sin burden transfers off of humans and onto Jesus, who was led outside of the tent/tabernacle of the camp/Israel…and was abandoned.25\n\nHe was left alone. The unclean one we send out is not one of us lowly humans but God in the flesh (John 1:1) who has died and risen from the dead (Hebrews 13:11-13).\n\nBy faith in Jesus’ sacrificial atonement and His rising from the grave, we gain community through Him. In one of the climaxes of the letter to the Hebrew church, it says,\n\n“Since we have confidence to enter the true Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus, and since we have a garage sale or charity. Please talk to a full-time staff person or your teacher about how you might give away your story contents and if this would help the organization this season.\n- Once all of the parts are in place and you have completed interviews, run your story past your teacher to ensure it’s meeting expectations BEFORE you turn it in.\n\nHcB.11.1.10.CCHA: Analyze how a variety of personal, community, and seasonal factors that influence food intake.\n\nObjectives 1.

Together we are producing servant leaders who will change their world by seeking to serve rather than looking to be served.\n\nState Certificate of Service\n\nInitiated in Pennsylvania, students are recognized for their community service by the State. The PA Department of Education provides schools with a Certificate of Service for eligible students. These certificates can be presented during an appropriate recognition program or awards day. Teachers will sign the certificates. We have produced a Google Form for you to submit your CTC students’ service hours. To access the submission spreadsheet, click on this link:   https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeEhUqfnzZGVYG7QJ0-3okg__rk3IgUZGSx1ad_9qlofnRMkA/viewform?usp=sf_link\n\nSpecific steps on how to submit information to receive certificates are included in the toolkit. As you will read in the application, completion of the form includes the name of the student, grade, hours volunteered, organization, name and email of mentor and the allotted presentation date.\n\nHoly Halloween Tuesday, October 30th Halloween Carnival fun. Instructors escort students through the elementary school for trick-or-treating. Students will make goodie bags and provide Halloween treats. Students may also participate in games and crafts with the youngsters in some instances. \nThanks for Giving November 22nd (Or any day prior to Thanksgiving break) Thanksgiving Basket preparation. Student labs will prepare all parts of a Thanksgiving meal for a needy person / family including travel accommodations. The meal can be delivered or picked up. Your students will present the gift box to the recipient and spend time with the title of an individual project, a unique identifying acronym, and the signature of the participants required. As the use of paper trails diminishes more every day, it is important to note that these original signatures, not copies, must be obtained and submitted.\n\nPage two needs to include specific information about the project, including an itemized list of time spent on each facet of the project. Those steps that make up a particular service project will take some time to complete, but it will be time well spent. We strongly advise checking with your teacher to ensure all components are fully addressed. As previously noted, there is no limit on the number of awards you can earn each year.\n\nWhen you visit with your teacher, you will need to provide him/her with this information:\n\n- Your CTC name in the box (no acronyms please)\n- Your teacher’s name\n- Your teacher’s email address\n- Name of the organization served\n- Specific project you worked on or completed\n- List each task done in relation to the project\n- Number of hours you volunteered in total\n- Your email address so we can communicate directly with you, if needed\n- Mark all the changes you have made on your document after meeting with teacher or counselor\n- Any other items as requested by local teacher\n\nInstructor or Guidance Office designee:\n\nThe goal of submitting this information to the Department of Education is to recognize & honor the efforts of the students who selflessly donate a min. of 50 hours to their communities. Research indicates that persons who are actively involved in giving to their world become engaged citizens and are leaders in their communities. Thus we recognize these students as integral to the long-term health and vitality of our communities.\n\nUse this google link to access the certificate grid once students have returned their completed logs to you for signature.

The EMT Concentrator Modules include Student Clearances & Immunizations, OSHA/Legal/Ethics, EMS Operations and Documentation, Basic Airway Techniques, Patient Assessment, Medical Emergencies, and Trauma for EMT’s.\nThe Health and Safety Occupations program prepares students to make any of several career choices in the healthcare industry. Health Care is one of the largest, fastest growing fields in the United States. This program provides instruction in direct patient care while focusing on the many career opportunities in the healthcare field. As a second year option, students are invited to enroll in the nursing assistant clinical experience which is designed to give those students who have completed all required instructional elements the necessary clinical experience to complete the Nursing Assistant Competency Exam, which is required to be placed on the nurse aide registry. Students will perform these services as a health care team member while learning about patient assessment, medication and food preparation, assistance with the delivery of basic care, supplies/materials handling and hospital organization. In addition to fulfilling a secondary school student’s academic requirements in math, science, English, and health/physical education, the Health and Safety Occupations Skills Certificate program at the Greater Johnstown Career & Technology Center (GJCTC) provides classroom instruction and supervised practical experience in: • Recording vital signs such as blood pressure, temperature, respirations, and use of pulse oximeter • Assisting with physical, personal and restorative care • Height and weight • Feeding, bathing, dressing and patient hygiene care • CPR certification for the professional rescuer and Health Care Provider through the American Red Cross, our recognized provider • Patient safety and the prevention of accidents • Becoming an excellent technical assistant in a variety of health care professions Students who will be completing this program: • Will have an insight into a field of work that can help them choose a career path related to healthcare • Will have an understanding of healthcare safety and transmission of infection. • May enter college or postsecondary training with college credits toward a degree or certification that can be used as they further their career in a professional health occupations field. • Must have current physical, vaccinations, 2- part PPD, criminal background check and child abuse clearance.is will lead them into a rewarding field that focuses on direct patient care. Problem Based Learning Within a learning module, teachers present a problem for students to solve. Students must develop a plan of action that will facilitate the accomplishment of the task. In the case of this, we do have a particular program curriculum that we impart with the need for the student to be able to complete their service project within the scope of our program description, ie. Health and Safety. We will review the student’s information and notify the students and their teacher when they have reached the criteria and the required 40 hours for completion of this Certificate. Students will only receive one certificate per year. Your submitted information will also be used to help create the Recognition Program and materials. \n\nCareer and Work Plan Awards\n\nWhen a student finishes a Career and Work Plan, it will stay on this state issued form from Future ReadyPA -\n\nEmail JaredKustaborder@CTC.CC to request a personalized template.

To that end, the Department of Education sets thresholds with state certification to recognize students across the Commonwealth with standardized documentation. Each career instructor is given a future ready PA profile form to tract participation. Usually, 40 hours of community service learning yields students 2 points towards graduation requirements. This was our initial offering to students. Now, we are using the Pennsylvania State Certification as both a means to collect evidence and recognize your students.\n\nStudent Documentation Worksheet\n\n- What project you completed and who this project will benefit\n- Why effective service is helpful to others and how your contributions advantage someone else\n- Your Personal Reflection and what lessons were learned: evaluate how your project plan was effective or could have been improved; relate how this forms become available for families who would like child specific information). There is a grade appropriate sheet for students to try different career activities based on their age. The more activities you perform, the greater the student’s chance to earn this award. The goal is for students to war one award for each completed grade; however, students striving for more can complete several plans throughout the school year, each involving a different category to meet one of our students become contributing members of the community as outlined in the mission statement.\n\n Five Steps to Service Learning\n\nPrepare\n\nIdentify a need or cause that is of concern or interest to you.

Together we are producing servant leaders who will change their world by seeking to inspire, equip, and empower others. We hope these directions will help you create a service learning opportunity in your classroom/program! If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to your GJCTC New Classroom Based Community Service Liaison. \n\nQ: Can I have students work in teams?\nA: Yes! Students should have ample opportunity to develop their own unique personal leadership skills to facilitate and communicate with community partners and their peers in completing their proposed project. \nAlthough other schoolwide service opportunities may be available, this should stem from student interest and be their initial project to see how their classroom learning can benefit the school and local community. \nStudents in the same class period may work on projects such as fundraisers collectively and can coordinate with another class period’s students for addi-tional supports; however, each student needs to com-plete and turn in their own plan and document their own hours.\n\nQ: Can students volunteer at an animal shelter?\nA: Yes. A better question would be to ask students to plan a community outreach project at their shelter or another agency that heightens awareness about a public issue to instill empathy as well as assist those in their community. (Learning modules can be used to assist)\n\nQ: Can students work on several projects of less than 10 hours?\nA: Yes. Students can combine all time spent within one year on plans that fall under our GJCTC and earn a certifi-cate that way. Look at the Career and Work Plan Examples for ideas.\n\nQ: Can students get paid or earn money and count it here?\nA: Nope. Hours being counted for on this certificate must be 100 % UNPAID. While some students may elect to do paid internship or work experience opportunities that provide them with experience in their career related field:https://www.pghrivers.org/ wetsthezscience\n\nQ: What if I want to focus on getting them engaged in their community through other ways?\nA: We absolutely want to encourage helping others in any way, shape or form. While the state/federal govern-ment allows employment to count as a work learning experience, our focus with this project is to begin this initial exploration to highlight transferable professional economic DOMAIN related skills that help our students grow and continue to positively impact these and other community missions after they graduate from our programs. \n\nIf you have an idea, but it doesn’t fit the criteria, please contact your community service coordinator here at GJCTC to find a way to mold it into meeting these guidelines\n\nQ: Do internships or non paid experiences count for this?\nA: Not for this certificate per requirements intended; however, unofficial records can absolutely be used to supplement and verify experience put forth for other recognition, awards and scholarships. Again, all student experience is valuable, but the focus for this particu-lar plan is on becoming aware of how their educational pathway fits within multiple social agencies within the community at large.\n\nTitle VII: The Greater Johnstown Career and Technology Center Title IX/Sec. 504/ADA Coordinator.
