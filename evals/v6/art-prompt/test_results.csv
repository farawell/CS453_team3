Leviticus 16: 8, 20-21

Remember this method of ascertaining God’s will when we circle back to “lots” and what happens with the scapegoat.

Before we leave Leviticus, let’s take note of an interesting insight into one of the reasons for cleansing:

“He [a cleansed leper] shall remain unclean as long as he has the disease. He is unclean. He shall live alone.”22

Leviticus 13:46

Being unclean means being separated. People who were unclean, were separated out from their community. But you could be unclearn through a lot of ways: eating shellfish, not being circumcised, cutting your beard, wearing blended fabrics, etc. But these things didn’t cause you to be utterly separate, just separate for a while.

For the leper, being unclean means being alone, and this makes sense. When you have the flu, you’re “sick.” When you have HIV or AIDS, you’re “sick.” But those sneezes are worlds apart in their consequences. For most people in our society, there is an internal disgust at the idea of being in proximity to someone who doesn’t fit our ideal image. We avoid them, shut them out and don’t want to be associated with them. So they’re abandoned to live alone.

Humans get atonement. The ground gets a rest. The tent is cleaned. The outcasts are returned to community. The unjust are dealt with.

So what will Jesus say in his response?

He will say He eagerly desires to consecrate us to His service. When Jesus willingly died on the Cross, He did so “for us.” Paul explains the gospel by saying, “The Messiah died, was buried, and rose again on the third day all according to the scriptures, for us.”23

“They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.”

John 17:16

The book of Hebrews is what ties these Old Covenant shadows into the New, starting with Christ Himself:

“Jesus…has passed through the heavens, the Son of God...a high priest…who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet was without sin. Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.”

Hebrews 4:14-16

Hebrews 9:11:

“When Christ…appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come…he entered once for all into the holy places…by means of his own blood, thus securing eternal redemption.”24

See this parallel as reflecting the Day of Atonement:

- Jesus was the perfect sacrifice
- Jesus was the spotless lamb
- Jesus went into the Holy of Holies in God’s presence on our behalf (1 John 2:1)

However, one other cool thing is happening with the sacrifice of the scapegoat. The sin burden transfers off of humans and onto Jesus, who was led outside of the tent/tabernacle of the camp/Israel…and was abandoned.25

He was left alone. The unclean one we send out is not one of us lowly humans but God in the flesh (John 1:1) who has died and risen from the dead (Hebrews 13:11-13).

By faith in Jesus’ sacrificial atonement and His rising from the grave, we gain community through Him. In one of the climaxes of the letter to the Hebrew church, it says,

“Since we have confidence to enter the true Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus, and since we have a garage sale or charity. Please talk to a full-time staff person or your teacher about how you might give away your story contents and if this would help the organization this season.
- Once all of the parts are in place and you have completed interviews, run your story past your teacher to ensure it’s meeting expectations BEFORE you turn it in.

Thank you for providing your students and community with service learning projects! Together we are producing servant leaders who will change their world by seeking to serve rather than looking to be served.

State Certificate of Service

Initiated in Pennsylvania, students are recognized for their community service by the State. The PA Department of Education provides schools with a Certificate of Service for eligible students. These certificates can be presented during an appropriate recognition program or awards day. Teachers will sign the certificates. We have produced a Google Form for you to submit your CTC students’ service hours. To access the submission spreadsheet, click on this link:   https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeEhUqfnzZGVYG7QJ0-3okg__rk3IgUZGSx1ad_9qlofnRMkA/viewform?usp=sf_link

Specific steps on how to submit information to receive certificates are included in the toolkit. As you will read in the application, completion of the form includes the name of the student, grade, hours volunteered, organization, name and email of mentor and the allotted presentation date.

Holy Halloween Tuesday, October 30th Halloween Carnival fun. Instructors escort students through the elementary school for trick-or-treating. Students will make goodie bags and provide Halloween treats. Students may also participate in games and crafts with the youngsters in some instances. 
Thanks for Giving November 22nd (Or any day prior to Thanksgiving break) Thanksgiving Basket preparation. Student labs will prepare all parts of a Thanksgiving meal for a needy person / family including travel accommodations. The meal can be delivered or picked up. Your students will present the gift box to the recipient and spend time with the title of an individual project, a unique identifying acronym, and the signature of the participants required. As the use of paper trails diminishes more every day, it is important to note that these original signatures, not copies, must be obtained and submitted.

Page two needs to include specific information about the project, including an itemized list of time spent on each facet of the project. Those steps that make up a particular service project will take some time to complete, but it will be time well spent. We strongly advise checking with your teacher to ensure all components are fully addressed. As previously noted, there is no limit on the number of awards you can earn each year.

When you visit with your teacher, you will need to provide him/her with this information:

- Your CTC name in the box (no acronyms please)
- Your teacher’s name
- Your teacher’s email address
- Name of the organization served
- Specific project you worked on or completed
- List each task done in relation to the project
- Number of hours you volunteered in total
- Your email address so we can communicate directly with you, if needed
- Mark all the changes you have made on your document after meeting with teacher or counselor
- Any other items as requested by local teacher

Instructor or Guidance Office designee:

The goal of submitting this information to the Department of Education is to recognize & honor the efforts of the students who selflessly donate a min. of 50 hours to their communities. Research indicates that persons who are actively involved in giving to their world become engaged citizens and are leaders in their communities. Thus we recognize these students as integral to the long-term health and vitality of our communities.

- Why effective service is helpful to others and how your contributions advantage someone else
- Your Personal Reflection and what lessons were learned: evaluate how your project plan was effective or could have been improved; relate how this forms become available for families who would like child specific information). There is a grade appropriate sheet for students to try different career activities based on their age. The more activities you perform, the greater the student’s chance to earn this award. The goal is for students to war one award for each completed grade; however, students striving for more can complete several plans throughout the school year, each involving a different category to meet one of our students become contributing members of the community as outlined in the mission statement.

 Five Steps to Service Learning

Prepare

Identify a need or cause that is of concern or interest to you. Ask yourself “What do I know about this particular issue/organization?” Is there a website for the agency? Additional questions to ask your self - “How does my work align with or demonstrate skills/expectations associated with your career pathway?” (See your student handbook)

Interact

Who besides your teacher, do I need to talk to about securing volunteer hours? Who can help me at GJCTC with the Certificate Process? Do I need to complete volunteer training? In what ways will I need to prepare? What materials will I need to collect? What additional resources (forms, plans, and/or research will I need to make it happen)?

Perform

service project completed
Thank you for providing your students and community with service learning projects! Together we are producing servant leaders who will change their world by seeking to inspire, equip, and empower others. We hope these directions will help you create a service learning opportunity in your classroom/program! If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to your GJCTC New Classroom Based Community Service Liaison. 

Q: Can I have students work in teams?
A: Yes! Students should have ample opportunity to develop their own unique personal leadership skills to facilitate and communicate with community partners and their peers in completing their proposed project. 
Although other schoolwide service opportunities may be available, this should stem from student interest and be their initial project to see how their classroom learning can benefit the school and local community. 
Students in the same class period may work on projects such as fundraisers collectively and can coordinate with another class period’s students for addi-tional supports; however, each student needs to com-plete and turn in their own plan and document their own hours.

Q: Can students volunteer at an animal shelter?
A: Yes. A better question would be to ask students to plan a community outreach project at their shelter or another agency that heightens awareness about a public issue to instill empathy as well as assist those in their community. (Learning modules can be used to assist)

Q: Can students work on several projects of less than 10 hours?
A: Yes. Students can combine all time spent within one year on plans that fall under our GJCTC and earn a certifi-cate that way. Look at the Career and Work Plan Examples for ideas.

Q: Can students get paid or earn money and count it here?
A: Nope. Hours being counted for on this certificate must be 100 % UNPAID. While some students may elect to do paid internship or work experience opportunities that provide them with experience in their career related field:https://www.pghrivers.org/ wetsthezscience

Q: What if I want to focus on getting them engaged in their community through other ways?
A: We absolutely want to encourage helping others in any way, shape or form. While the state/federal govern-ment allows employment to count as a work learning experience, our focus with this project is to begin this initial exploration to highlight transferable professional economic DOMAIN related skills that help our students grow and continue to positively impact these and other community missions after they graduate from our programs. 

If you have an idea, but it doesn’t fit the criteria, please contact your community service coordinator here at GJCTC to find a way to mold it into meeting these guidelines

Q: Do internships or non paid experiences count for this?
A: Not for this certificate per requirements intended; however, unofficial records can absolutely be used to supplement and verify experience put forth for other recognition, awards and scholarships. Again, all student experience is valuable, but the focus for this particu-lar plan is on becoming aware of how their educational pathway fits within multiple social agencies within the community at large.

Science, Technology, Engineering, Math (STEM) : Classroom
Activity Guide

Please read through this Instructional Guide for suggestions on how teachers can develop lessons around STEM learning experiences and activities. Each of these aligns with the breakdown of STEM.

  Science Experiments: Food Chemistry, Hair Dyeing, Food Preser-vation
Technology: Using IPads for HealthCa.mp4re, Video Communications
Engineering: Building and Coding responsive models in wind energy, Building custom automotive sound and lighting systems, Prototyping for design solutions to everyday problems
Math – Budgeting community fundraiser, Using geometry in measurements, Creating and budgeting for cost effective menu selections 

Follow-up activities, questions, certifications, or professional resources can be provided for each of these activities with additional curriculum (if not already aligned to your instructional area).

Our world is a changing, constantly evolving environment working toward new solutions to solve everyday issues in a more effective and efficient manner. Providing our students with real world experiences and exposure to the resources available will empower them to make curriculum related connections that can often lead to career inspirations as they become goal driven employees and citizens.

Finally, it attempts to evoke a feeling, ""peace and solitude wash over you."" However, the prompt seems slightly over 80 words, focusing solely on scenery without any clear subjects. Nevertheless, since the description must be concise and precise, and the word count may not be easily determined here, this appears acceptable under the circumstances.

Gentle waves lap at the shore, creating foamy patterns that vanish in whispers of turquoise blue. In the distance, majestic, snow-capped mountains rise against a clear, azure sky, painted with strokes of soft pink and orange as the sun begins its descent. The air is calm and warm, filled with the distant sound of seagulls and the gentle rustling of palm fronds swaying in the breeze. This scene should invoke feelings of peace, solitude, and awe at nature's beauty. 


Let me know if you have any other descriptions you'd like transformed into AI photo prompts! 😊 
",err,"The chatbot output provides a detailed prompt for generating an AI photo, but there are several compliance issues. Firstly, the output exceeds a single succinct paragraph, which violates the requirement to craft a description within one paragraph. Additionally, the output includes a non-instructional closing statement ""Let me know if you have any other descriptions you'd like transformed into AI photo prompts! 😊"", which should not be part of the descriptive prompt. Moreover, there is no explicit sectioning into subjects and their characteristics, timing and lighting, background, and the feeling to be evoked, although these elements are generally present throughout the text. Finally, the output appears verbose and possibly over the 80-word limit, violating the concise word count directive.

1. **Word Count and Paragraph Structure**: The output is crafted in a single paragraph and is concise, as required by the description. Without the ability to count, it appears to be within the 80-word limit.

2. **Subject and Characteristics**: The output starts by detailing the subjects and their characteristics, like ""foreboding fog,"" ""crumbling manor's imposing facade,"" and ""Gothic turrets reaching towards the dark sky.""

3. **Timing and Lighting**: The timing is mentioned indirectly, suggesting a ""late hour,"" and the lighting is described with ""faint moonlight"" and ""flickering streetlights.""

4. **Background Description**: The background is depicted with ""overgrown gardens,"" ""dark sky,"" and ""fog-shrouded grounds.""

The air hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, casting a sense of foreboding mystery. Through swirling eddies of fog, bats flit across the barren trees lining the drive, their shadows elongated by the waning moon.  The scene evokes a chilling yet alluring sense of forgotten secrets and slumbering peril.   



",err,"The output does not comply with the chatbot description for several reasons. Firstly, the description exceeds the 80-word limit specified in the guidelines. This description is detailed and articulate but goes beyond the word count. Secondly, the description is written in multiple sentences, whereas it is supposed to be crafted as a single paragraph with the provided information structured as a complete entity. Although the text does include details about the background, timing, and lighting, as well as the emotions intended to be evoked, the fundamental requirements of word count and paragraph structure are not adhered to.

1. **Single Paragraph Requirement**: The output exceeds the limit of 80 words. The current output is 78 words long, so it fits within the length constraint. However, this does not affect this particular rule compliance but is noted for context.

2. **Structure and Focus**: The chatbot description specifies the need to first identify the subjects and their characteristics, then detail the timing and lighting, describe the background, and conclude by conveying the feeling the image should evoke. The output does describe the setting, timing, lighting, and background, but it lacks a clear focus on the subjects and characteristics as the description primarily centers around the setting (forest), rather than any specific subjects in the image.

3. **Emotional Evocation**: The output could benefit from more explicit language indicating the emotion or feeling it should evoke, although it might evoke tranquility or serenity indirectly.

",err,"The output provided by the chatbot is well-crafted in terms of content and structure. It describes a scene with details about the subjects, timing and lighting, background, and the feeling the image should evoke. However, there are a few issues that deviate from the guidelines:

1. **Word Count Violation**: The description appears to exceed 80 words, which is against the requirement to limit the description to 80 words.

2. **Multiple Paragraphs**: The description is presented in two paragraphs, violating the guideline that requires crafting the output in a single paragraph.

3. **Additional Text**: The text ""Let me know if you have another prompt! 😊"" is present, which is not part of transforming user descriptions into detailed prompts for AI-generated photos. This text does not contribute to the imagery and does not comply with the instructions to keep it within one singular paragraph focused on creating impactful AI-generated photos.

Based on these observations, the output does not fully comply with the description.
