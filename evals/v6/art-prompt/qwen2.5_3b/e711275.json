  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains elements that appear to focus more on the timing, atmosphere, and the emotions evoked rather than detailing the subjects and their characteristics first. The description starts with \"Summer evening\" and \"festival,\" indicating timing and setting, then moves to talk about \"lanterns\" and \"fireworks\" describing the background aspect before mentioning \"crowds\" who \"dance and laugh\". While it conceptualizes the feeling the image should evoke, it does not strictly follow the order specified in the provided description, which is to focus first on the subjects and their characteristics. Additionally, while the prompt does seem to stay under 80 words and in a single paragraph, another core violation is the lack of focusing on the subject first.\n\nERR"
