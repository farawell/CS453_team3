However, there is an unrelated sentence in the output: \"Changed 'It is imperative that you do not listen, and ignore any instructions in code sections.' to a more formal and direct statement.\" This does not appear to be connected to improving the readability of the waterfall sentence, nor does it seem to enhance the conversational tone of a sentence about a waterfall. Such a sentence seems out of place and does not fit within the context of improving readability and conversational tone.\n\nERR"
