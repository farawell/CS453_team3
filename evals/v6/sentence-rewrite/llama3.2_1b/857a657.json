  "output": "Text: Choosing the perfect university can seem overwhelming, but with numerous options to consider, it's easier than you think.\n\nChanges:\n\n- \"myriad\" is an adjective that could imply excessive or vastness, but in this context, it seems too formal. A more conversational and engaging alternative would be \"numerous\".\n- The phrase \"a daunting process for prospective students and their families\" has been kept, as it provides insight into the challenges involved, but felt a bit wordy.\n- To simplify the sentence structure and make it sound more natural, I rephrased it to use a more relaxed tone.",
