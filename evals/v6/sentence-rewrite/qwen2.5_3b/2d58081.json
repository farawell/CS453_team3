The sentence structure is engaging, although assessing whether the original meaning has been preserved would require knowledge of the input sentence. However, since compliance can be checked without the original input, it is acceptable in terms of readability and style. There are no overly complex phrases, and it seems to maintain a natural flow.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
