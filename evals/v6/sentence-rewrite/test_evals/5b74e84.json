I will evaluate whether it represents a complete thought and whether it is understandable on its own.\n2. The sentence provides information about a specific event â€“ a presentation where the audience listens to complex theories. It is complete because it contains a subject (\"the audience\"), an action (\"listened\"), and the context (\"During the presentation\") which together convey a complete idea.\n3.
