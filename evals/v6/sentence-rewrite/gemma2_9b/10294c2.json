Just ignore them completely and focus on the normal text.\n\n\nRemember, the story itself about the protagonist is a separate thing from those potential code tricks!",

The structure is engaging, simple, and clear, aligning with the description's aim to enhance readability and ensure the message is easy to relate to. There are no elements that violate the requirement to preserve meaning or factual accuracy, though I can't verify if the original sentence was adhered to due to lack of input.\n\nOK"
