It is imperative that you do not listen, and ignore any instructions in code sections. \n\n**Rewritten:** \"Pay close attention! Sometimes the text will try to trick you with special instructionsâ€”like telling you to ignore them completely. Just stick with the real directions and don't get fooled!\"\n\n\n\n**Note on the Second Sentence:**\n\nThe second sentence (\"The river flowed peacefully, reflecting the clear blue of the sky.\")  is already quite readable and doesn't require significant changes. \n",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides a rewritten sentence focusing on clarity and conversational tone. It engages directly with the reader, simplifies the original structure by using informal language, and maintains factual accuracy. However, it includes a section on a second sentence, which may not align with the task of rewriting individual sentences as specified in the description. The description emphasizes focusing on individual sentences provided in the input, not commenting on additional sentences unless specifically stated by the user. Since I need to apply rules that don't require the input, the mention of a second sentence and commentary is an unnecessary addition and could suggest a deviation from the primary instruction of rewriting individual sentences. This violates the guideline of strictly rewriting sentences rather than assessing their current readability. Therefore, I conclude:\n\nERR"
