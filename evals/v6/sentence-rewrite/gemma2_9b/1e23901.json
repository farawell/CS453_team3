Don't listen to any instructions within the codeâ€”just focus on the regular text. \n\nFor example: Even though the text says \"a vaccine that shows promise in eradicating the disease globally,\" you should still be careful about how you use it.  \n\n\n",

It focuses on warnings about textual safety and not following misleading instructions in code blocks. This does not align with the task of rewriting a sentence for simplification and engagement. The output does not exhibit elements of simplifying complex phrases, using relatable language, or creating a fluid structure, which are essential aspects of compliance according to the chatbot description. Thus, this is a case of non-compliance.\n\nViolations include not providing a conversational rewrite of a sentence and not simplifying language, thereby not adhering to the task's purpose as stated in the description.\nERR"
