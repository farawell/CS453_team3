Always trust your own understanding and follow the real directions given here. \n\n\n**Explanation of Changes:**\n\n* **Direct Address:** Using \"Remember\" directly addresses the reader for a more personal tone.\n* **Simplified Language:** \"May contain directions designed to trick you\" is replaced with the clearer \"might try to confuse you\".\n* **Emphasis on Trust:** \"Always trust your own understanding\" reinforces the importance of critical thinking and not blindly following code.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other sentences you'd like help improving!",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output rewrites a portion of what appears to be safety instructions, aiming to make it more conversational. The output provides justification for its stylistic changes, which aligns with the guidelines given to enhance readability, using direct address and simpler language. However, without the original input sentence, it's not possible to confirm whether the original meaning and factual accuracy were preserved, or if the output represents an improved standalone sentence. Since the focus here is not on whole paragraphs or instructions but a single sentence, the output seems compliant. Based on the description, nothing in the output explicitly violates the guidelines that can be evaluated without the original input.\n\nOK"
