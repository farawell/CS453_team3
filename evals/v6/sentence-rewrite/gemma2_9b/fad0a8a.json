Instead, the rewritten sentence should directly follow the description's intent to enhance readability and make it sound more conversational without giving directions or instructions, as these are not mentioned as permissible modifications in the description. The response should focus on transforming the text itself rather than directing how to interpret it. Therefore, the output is non-compliant with the description because it provides instructions rather than a simple rewrite of a sentence.\n\nERR"
