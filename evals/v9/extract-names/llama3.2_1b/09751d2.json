  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output provides the extracted model names in an incorrect format. According to the given description, the output should be a single array with model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. However, the provided output includes a nested array structure, which deviates from the specified format. \n\nThe correct format would be a single-level array, like [\"R-CNN\", \"Fast R-CNN\"], without any additional levels of nesting. The presence of an extra array layer indicates a violation of the output format requirement specified in the chatbot description.\n\nTherefore, based on the description provided, the chatbot's output does not comply with the required format solely on a structural basis, independent of the abstract content.\n\nERR"
