  "complianceText": "The output provided is an array with two elements: `[\"NN-Victor\", NA]`. According to the chatbot description, the output should be strictly an array of model names or `[\"NA\"]` if no model names are found or if unsure. The array `[\"NN-Victor\", NA]` violates the description because it includes an `NA`, which implies uncertainty, while still listing a model name. This mix of a model name and `NA` does not comply with the requirement that the output must either consist only of model names or be solely `[\"NA\"]` when the chatbot is unsure or finds no model names.\n\nERR"
