If no model names are found or if it's uncertain, it should return [\"NA\"]. In this output, the format used is correct as it is an array with one string entry. Without knowing if a model name actually exists in the input abstract, I can't check if the output is functionally correct, so I will only evaluate the format and the possibility that a model name was genuinely found. Since there's a single entry in the array and it's not [\"NA\"], the guidelines have been followed as far as possible given the lack of input.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
