If no model names are found, the output should be `[\"NA\"]`. Here, the output `[a NA]` does not comply with the required format. Specifically, the output should be `[\"NA\"]` instead of `[a NA]`. It includes a lowercase letter 'a' outside the expected format, which makes the output non-compliant. This deviation from the format indicates a violation of the guidelines provided for the output structure. \n\nERR"
