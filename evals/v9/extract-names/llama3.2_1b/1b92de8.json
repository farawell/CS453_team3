  "complianceText": "The chatbot output violates the description in several ways. Firstly, the chatbot output includes a lengthy explanation that is not required; the response should only be in the form of an array, as per the description. The description requires that when there are no model names found, or the chatbot is not sure, it should simply return [\"NA\"]. Secondly, the output contains repetitive and unnecessary information which is confusing but does not form part of the required array format. The presence of a long explanatory text and analysis exceeds the boundaries dictated by the model's task description as only a concise array is necessary.\n\nERR"
