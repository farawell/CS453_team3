  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output consists of several model names listed within square brackets. According to the description provided, the output format should be an array of model names within square brackets and only include actual names of the models. The observed output violates a few expectations:\n\n1. The model names should be clearly separated and formatted like [\"model_name\"], but the entries are separated by the \"|\" character instead of a comma, which suggests that they are not formatted as a JSON array.\n\n2. There seems to be a model name \"mkl Toolbox\" included, which includes a space. If it were a valid model name, it should have been quoted properly to fit within the expected JSON string array format.\n\nBased on these observations, the output does not comply with the chatbot's description as it is not formatted correctly per the guidelines.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
