The description specifies that the response should be an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. There's no explicit indication in the description prohibiting duplicates, nor is there a mention of formatting issues beyond the requirement for an array of model names. Based on this description, the presence of duplicate entries is not directly addressed or restricted, which means it falls outside the scope of visible compliance issues without the input. Therefore, the chatbot's output format adheres to the required structure.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
