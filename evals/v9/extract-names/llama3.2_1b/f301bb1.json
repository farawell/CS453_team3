If no model names are found or if the bot is unsure, it should output `[\"NA\"]`. However, the output here contains multiple strings, not just one entry as specified. Additionally, irrelevant strings such as 'overview', 'with', and 'unimplemented' are included alongside 'NA', which suggests that the bot did not form a valid response per the task's rules. Therefore, it does not follow the correct format or the guideline of returning only `[\"NA\"]` when unsure. \n\nERR"
