  "complianceText": "The chatbot output consists of an array containing the model names \"T5\" and \"T5 model\". According to the description, if a model name is found, it should be formatted as [\"model_name\"]. The output complies because it follows the specified format. There is no indication that any rule was violated based on the format expectations of the output, as the format specified allows for multiple names to be listed as separate elements in the array. Since I am not provided with the input, I cannot verify if these names were correctly extracted, but compliance does not require checking correctness.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
