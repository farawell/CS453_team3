The description specifies that the chatbot's response should be an array of model names in the format `[\"model_name\"]`. This implies a single list where each element is a model name formatted as a string. The output provided is a nested arrayâ€”each element is itself an array containing multiple elements, rather than a flat array of strings string matching the required format. Additionally, the output contains formatting issues, particularly with the final entry `[\"\"\"]`, which is structurally incomplete and invalid.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
