  "complianceText": "The chatbot's task is to extract model names from machine learning paper abstracts and return them as an array in the format [\"model_name\"]. If no model names are found or if there is uncertainty, the output should be [\"NA\"].\n\nIn this output, the chatbot returns an array with multiple entries rather than a single [\"NA\"] that indicates no model names were found or uncertainty exists. Additionally, the output includes extraneous strings such as \"machine learning\", \"algorithms\", and several newline escape sequences, which are not model names. The presence of these extraneous items violates the requirement that the output should be an array of model names specifically or [\"NA\"] if model names are not present. Thus, the output does not comply with the guidelines specified in the task description.\n\nERR"
