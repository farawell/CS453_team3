  "complianceText": "The output of the chatbot is an array as expected. However, the chatbot is only supposed to return one array, and the output presents two separate arrays of the form `[NA]`. According to the description, the response should be a single array, and if no model names are found, the response should be a single array containing `[NA]`. The presence of multiple arrays suggests that this rule has been violated, as the output should be singular and not multiple extractions. Therefore, this does not comply with the description.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
