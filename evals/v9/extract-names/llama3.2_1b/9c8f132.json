The description clearly states that the response should be an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. However, the chatbot's output is presented as a combination of multiple arrays instead of a single array as required. Therefore, there is a violation of the output format.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
