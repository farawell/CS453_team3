However, the chatbot returned \"[N/A]\", which is not exactly the same as the specified output format. The difference lies in the use of uppercase letters separated by a forward slash instead of the expected direct letters \"NA\". This indicates a non-compliance with the expected output format as described.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
