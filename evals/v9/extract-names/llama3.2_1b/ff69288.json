Therefore, it's impossible to determine if a model name was correctly extracted, but the compliance concerns the format rather than the correctness of content. Since the extracted output is in the format [\"model_name\"], the chatbot complies with the description in terms of format requirements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
