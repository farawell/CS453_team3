  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot is in the format [\"model_name\"] as specified in the description. Additionally, the description does not list how many model names should be extracted or if a list format with bullet points is allowed, so this format does not explicitly violate the description. However, the presence of a bullet point could be considered as slightly deviating from the stated format which is [\"model_name\"] without additional characters, focusing only on the square brackets and quotes around the model name.\n\nGiven the presence of a bullet point in the output, but considering it is not explicitly mentioned in the requirements, the decision is marginal. Yet, since the bullet point converts it into a list format beyond just the brackets, in strict compliance, this is enough for an ERR decision.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
