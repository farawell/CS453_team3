  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output presents a list of model names, which aligns with the format requirement of returning an array of model names in the form [\"model_name\"]. However, the phrase \"Here is the list of model names extracted from the abstracts:\" is additional text and does not comply with the description, which specifies that the output should be an array of model names without any additional text or introduction. Based on the description, if there are model names present, they should be listed directly in the array format, and nothing else should precede or follow this list in the output, aside from the JSON array syntax.\n\nThis violates the description that specifies the output format strictly as an array. Hence, this is deemed non-compliant.\n\nERR"
