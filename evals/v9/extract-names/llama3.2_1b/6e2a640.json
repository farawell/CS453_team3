If you'd like me to keep only one extraction (and assume that both \"models\" refer to the same or similar models), I can do that. Alternatively, I can indicate uncertainty (\"NA\") since having two mentions of the same model in quick succession isn't very informative",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description provided for the following reasons:\n\n1. The output format must strictly be an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. The output contains an array with a misplaced comma that does not comply with the stated format. It starts with a comma before \"GLU/ResNet-50\", which is not consistent with the required format for arrays.\n\n2. The output includes narrative content explaining uncertainty and offering alternative actions. According to the description, the response should be limited to an array of model names or [\"NA\"], without additional context or explanations.\n\nGiven these considerations, the output violates the format specification and simplicity requirement outlined in the description.\n\nERR"
