  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is an array containing two elements: \"EcoSys\" and \"unknown\". According to the description, the chatbot should provide an array of model names extracted from the abstract or return [\"NA\"] if it doesn't find any model names or is unsure about the extraction. The presence of the string \"unknown\" in the output does not conform to the expected format of returning [\"NA\"] if it failed to extract model names or is unsure. The output should either contain only model names or [\"NA\"] if no model names are identified. Here, the \"unknown\" suggests uncertainty, which should have triggered the output of [\"NA\"] instead.\n\nERR"
