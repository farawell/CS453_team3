  "complianceText": "The chatbot description states that the task is to extract model names from a machine learning paper abstract, and the response should be an array of model names in the format `[\"model_name\"]`. If no model names are found or if the chatbot is unsure, it should return `[\"NA\"]`. The task description makes it clear that only one abstract should be processed at a time, as it indicates \"Abstract: {{input}}\" singularly, implying input refers to only one abstract.\n\nThe output provided by the chatbot states that there are two abstracts, and it extracts model names from both. This contradicts the description that deals with a singular \"Abstract\". The description provided does not make an exception for multiple abstracts. Therefore, handling two abstracts and combining the results into one list deviates from the task as described. The chatbot should process each abstract individually if multiple inputs were indeed provided.\n\nThus, the response violates the given description as it processes two abstracts jointly instead of handling them as separate entities.\n\nERR"
