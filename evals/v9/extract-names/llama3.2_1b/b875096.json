The output from the chatbot starts with \"Here is the list of extracted model names:\" which is not needed. Furthermore, the format contains duplicate characters like leading and trailing commas and mismatched brackets, as seen in ([\\\",AlphaNet\\\"] , [\\\",BetaNet\\\"]]). According to the description, the output should simply be a single array of model names in the format of [\"model_name\"], without introducing additional phrasing or incorrectly formatted elements like unmatched brackets or extra commas.\n\nERR"
