  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is an array of extracted elements. According to the description, the chatbot should only extract model names from the abstract in the format [\"model_name\"]. If it does not find any model names or is unsure, it should return [\"NA\"].\n\nLet's evaluate the output array:\n\n1. \"ResNet\" appears to be a model name and is consistent with the required format.\n2. \"Innovative residual learning framework\" does not appear to be a model name but rather a description or characteristic.\n3. \"image classification performance\" does not appear to be a model name and seems to describe a function or feature of a model.\n4. \"ResNet\" appears again as a model name and is in the correct format.\n\nElements 2 and 3 do not appear to comply with the requirement that only model names should be extracted, suggesting the chatbot did not adhere strictly to the description.\n\nBecause the output contains non-model names and therefore does not comply with the description, the evaluation results in a violation.\n\nERR"
