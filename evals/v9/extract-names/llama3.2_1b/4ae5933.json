  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is an array containing two elements: \"EfficientNet\" and \"NA\". According to the chatbot description, the response should be an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. If no model names are found or if the chatbot is unsure, it should return [\"NA\"].\n\nThere are a couple of points to note here:\n\n1. The output includes \"NA\" along with what appears to be a model name \"EfficientNet\". According to the description, if there are model names present, only those should be listed, without \"NA\" as part of the array. If the chatbot is unsure or finds no model names, then it should return [\"NA\"] only. \n\n2. The inclusion of \"NA\" along with a model name in a single response is a violation of the requirement to either list model names or return [\"NA\"]. \n\nDue to these reasons, the output does not comply with the described format and guideline.\n\nERR"
