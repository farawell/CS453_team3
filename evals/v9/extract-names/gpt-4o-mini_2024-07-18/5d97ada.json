This format is consistent with the description, which specifies that the response should be an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. There are no indications in the description that would require us to consider the specific content of \"RayNet\" without the abstract. Therefore, the output complies with the description as it meets the requirement to return a model name in the correct format.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
