This suggests that the output is compliant with the requirement to extract model names and return them in the specific format. However, without the input abstract, it is impossible to determine if the name provided is a genuine model name from a machine learning paper abstract. Thus, we must assume compliance in the format and structure aspects as specified by the task.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
