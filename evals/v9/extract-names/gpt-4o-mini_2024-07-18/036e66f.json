Given that no input is provided, I cannot evaluate whether any model names were present in the input abstract, so the compliance with the description is met as long as the logic was applied correctly. There is no evidence in the output that violates the described behavior. Therefore, the output complies with the description given.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
