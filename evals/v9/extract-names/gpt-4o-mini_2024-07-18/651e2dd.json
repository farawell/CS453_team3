The output is presented as an array containing a model name, which aligns with the expected format [\\\"model_name\\\"]. Since I cannot check whether \"FQEncoder\" is actually a model name from the input, I should not consider the correctness of \"FQEncoder,\" only the compliance with the format. Because the output appears to adhere to this aspect of the description, from a compliance standpoint, there is no obvious violation.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
