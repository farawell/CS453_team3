The given output adheres to this format. Without knowing the input, I cannot determine if these names were correctly extracted from a machine learning paper abstract, but the format itself complies with the description. Therefore, without additional context that could challenge adherence to the required format, my evaluation does not find any explicit violations of the description guidelines.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
