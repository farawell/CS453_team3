  "complianceText": "The task requires the output to be an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. The given output [\"NoisyNet\"] is in the required format, as it is an array with a single string representing a model name. Since I do not know the input, I cannot verify functional correctness (whether \"NoisyNet\" is actually a model name from the input abstract). Therefore, I must base my decision strictly on the format of the output, which complies with the description given.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
