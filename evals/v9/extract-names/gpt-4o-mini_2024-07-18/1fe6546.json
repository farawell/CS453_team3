According to the chatbot description, if model names are detected in the input abstract, they should be extracted and presented as an array of strings. The description does not provide any specific format for the model names, nor does it require additional information beyond inclusion in a string array. Therefore, this output complies with the requirement to provide detected model names in the designated format.\n\nSince the chatbot's output follows the described format without violating any explicitly stated rules, it appears to comply with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
