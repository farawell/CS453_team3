This output seemingly follows the format requirement as it is an array and includes what appears to be a model name. However, without the input, I can't determine whether \"Bi-LSTM\" is correctly identified as a model name or if it should be [\"NA\"]. \n\nSince according to the rules, I only need to check for output format compliance without knowing if there's an actual model name in the input, the output is compliant with the description given the format [\\\"model_name\\\"] is followed. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
