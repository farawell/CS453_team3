Since we are not given the input, we cannot determine if \"XLNet\" was actually mentioned in the abstract or not. We can only evaluate based on the format, not the presence or absence of the model name in the input. Therefore, the output complies with the description regarding the required format.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
