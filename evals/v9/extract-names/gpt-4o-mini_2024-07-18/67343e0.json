Since we do not have the input, we cannot verify whether \"MobileNet\" is indeed a model name extracted from the abstract, but since compliance checking does not require such an input, and the output is correctly formatted as per the guidelines given, there is no evident non-compliance with the task description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
