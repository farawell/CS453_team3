This format is consistent with the requirements specified in the description. Without having the input, it cannot be determined whether \"PentaCore\" is indeed a model name extracted from a machine learning paper abstract. Thus, according to the description, I should not evaluate the correctness of the model name extraction, only the format of the output which is complied with. Therefore, the output is considered compliant.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
