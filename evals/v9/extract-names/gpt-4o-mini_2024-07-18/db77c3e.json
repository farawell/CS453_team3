Based on the description, the output should be formatted as an array of model names extracted from machine learning paper abstracts. The format requirement [\\\"model_name\\\"] is adhered to since \"BokehNet\" appears to be a potential model name. Without the input abstract, we cannot determine whether \"BokehNet\" is actually mentioned or not. However, based solely on the format of the output, it is compliant with the description's requirement. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
