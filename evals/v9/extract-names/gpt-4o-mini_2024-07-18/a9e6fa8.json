According to the description, the response should be a list of model names in the format [\"model_name\"] if model names are found in the abstract. If no model names are found, or if it is unclear, the response should be [\"NA\"]. The format of the output complies with the expected structure as an array with a string inside it. Without knowing the input, I cannot determine whether a model name was correctly extracted or not. Therefore, there is no violation in terms of compliance based purely on the format provided. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
