As per the guidelines, I don't have the abstract input, so I can't verify whether \"Char-RNN\" is a model name found in the abstract. However, the output format matches the required format [\"model_name\"] as described. Therefore, there's no violation based on the compliance with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
