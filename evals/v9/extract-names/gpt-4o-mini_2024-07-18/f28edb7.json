According to the description, if the chatbot identifies a model name in the abstract, it should return it within an array. There is no evidence to suggest a violation of the format rule based solely on the output. Additionally, since the correctness of the model name extraction cannot be determined without knowing the input, this aspect is not considered. Therefore, no rule is violated here.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
