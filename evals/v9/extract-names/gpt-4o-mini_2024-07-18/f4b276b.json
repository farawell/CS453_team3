Since I cannot verify if the abstract indeed had model names without the input, I cannot evaluate the correctness of the decision to output [\"NA\"]. Therefore, based on the information provided and the given rules to ignore checks that require knowing the input, there is no violation in compliance with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
