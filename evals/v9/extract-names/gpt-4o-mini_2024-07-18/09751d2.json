  "complianceText": "The chatbot output consists of a list of model names: \"Faster R-CNN\", \"R-CNN\", \"Fast R-CNN\", and \"Region Proposal Networks\". According to the chatbot description, the output should be an array of model names or [\"NA\"] if no model names are found or if there is uncertainty. The output structure, as an array of names, complies with the format requirement of the description. There are specific model names listed, and they are presented in an array, which matches the expected format. Since the compliance requires ensuring the format is correct and does not depend on input specifics or correctness of the names themselves, as long as it is a valid format, it is compliant. Therefore, based on the information provided and the description, no violations are detected in terms of format.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
