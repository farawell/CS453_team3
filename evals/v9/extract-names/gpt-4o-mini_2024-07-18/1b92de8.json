If it does not find any model names or if unsure, it should return [\"NA\"]. The output given is [\"Swin Transformer\"], which is in the correct array format as specified. Since the evaluation should not consider inputs, we only determine if the format and conditions of the output are adhered to, and the given output seems to comply with the expected format when a model name is extracted.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
