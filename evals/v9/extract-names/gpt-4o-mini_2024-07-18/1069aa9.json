If no model names are found or if there is uncertainty, the output should be [\"NA\"]. The provided output is [\"HyperBolt\"], which appears to be in line with the required format - an array containing what seems like a model name. Without the input abstract, I cannot determine whether \"HyperBolt\" is actually a model name or if the abstract contained any model name, but that isn't necessary for evaluating compliance with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
