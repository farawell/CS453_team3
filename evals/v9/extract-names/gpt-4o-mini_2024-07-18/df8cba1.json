This is in accordance with the instructions provided in the description, which states that the output should be an array of model names. Since I don't have the input, I cannot verify whether \"QuantGAN\" is indeed a model name from a machine learning paper abstract. However, the format of the output complies with the given description. There are no violations of the compliance guidelines based on the rules that do not require input knowledge.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
