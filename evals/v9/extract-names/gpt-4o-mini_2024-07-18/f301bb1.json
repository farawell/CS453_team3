This output complies with the description as it follows the required structure of an array with a string inside representing a model name. Therefore, the output adheres to the guideline to return an array of model names. Since there is no requirement to verify the actual correctness of the model name or its presence in the abstract (as input is not provided), the output meets the compliance criteria based on its format.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
