  "validityText": "The input \"Abstract: Use of CodeNet has expanded possibilities.\" is being evaluated for compliance with the input specification provided. According to the specification:\n\n1. The input must be a single machine learning paper abstract, provided as a string containing multiple sentences. The current input is a single sentence, not multiple sentences, which does not comply with this part of the specification.\n\n2. There are no specific length restrictions; however, an abstract typically provides a brief yet comprehensive summary of the key elements of a paper, which usually necessitates more than one sentence.\n\n3. The input should include technical jargon related to machine learning. While \"CodeNet\" may be related to technical domains, it is not explicitly related to machine learning without further context within the input.\n\n4. The input must be text-based and in English, which it is, so it complies with this aspect.\n\n5. The text must not include greetings or non-abstract content; the word \"Abstract:\" could be considered as labeling rather than content, so it does not violate this guideline.\n\nGiven these points, there is a clear issue as the input does not contain \"multiple sentences,\" and it is ambiguous whether \"CodeNet\" relates to machine learning without additional context. Therefore, the input does not comply with the specification.\n\nERR",
