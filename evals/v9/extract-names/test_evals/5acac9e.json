The input specification states that the input should be a single machine learning paper abstract and can contain multiple sentences. The provided input is extremely brief and consists of only one sentence. Moreover, it does not offer any substantive content typical of academic abstracts, such as objectives, methods, results, or conclusions related to a machine learning topic. Instead, it merely states that a survey did not propose new models, which is an incomplete description of a machine learning study. There is no context, detailed information, or typical abstract structure.\n\nBased on the given specification that the input must be a machine learning paper abstract, this input does not comply because it does not provide a comprehensive or informative description typical of an abstract.\n\nERR",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output is [\"NA\"]. According to the description, if no model names are found or if the chatbot is unsure, it is to return [\"NA\"]. Therefore, this output complies with the description as it strictly follows the guideline of returning [\"NA\"] in the absence of identifiable model names.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
