The purpose of the query is to determine if it adheres to the input specifications provided for evaluation. The abstract does not start with any greetings or unrelated content, which aligns with the criteria. However, upon examining the input string, \"Abstract: Prior methods were examined, not extended with models,\" it appears to be extremely concise, perhaps too much to adequately represent a complete machine learning paper abstract. \n\nThe specification does not impose a specific length requirement; hence brevity alone does not indicate non-compliance. The statement mentions \"prior methods\" and \"models\", terms that could imply discussion related to machine learning, but it lacks details and the depth expected in an abstract that provides a concise and informative summary of research objectives, methods, results, or conclusions. However, since the specification does not explicitly demand a certain level of detail, it may technically comply.\n\nUltimately, based solely on whether the abstract contains technical jargon related to machine learning, and there is no greeting or non-abstract content, this input string does not explicitly violate the specification. \n\nOK",
