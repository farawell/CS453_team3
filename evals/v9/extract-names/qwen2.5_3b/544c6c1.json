The output [[\"NA\"]] is formatted as an array, but it includes an extra pair of square brackets, resulting in a nested array instead of a simple array as specified in the description. This discrepancy indicates a violation of the expected output format. As per the description, the correct format should be [\"NA\"], without the additional bracket nesting.\n\nERR"
