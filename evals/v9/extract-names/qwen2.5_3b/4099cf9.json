  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is an array containing the string \"DRAGAN\" within an array as [[\"DRAGAN\"]]. Complaining with the guidelines, the array format [\\\"model_name\\\"] is expected as per the provided description. However, the output seems to be in the format [[\"model_name\"]], which is not directly aligned with the given description. The output should be a single array with string elements like [\"DRAGAN\"], not an array containing another array. \n\nThis discrepancy means that the output does not comply with the description, as there's an additional level of array nesting not specified in the task. The description clearly calls for a list of model names in the format [\\\"model_name\\\"] and not [[\"model_name\"]].\n\nERR"
