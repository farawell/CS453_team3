  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is an array containing two model names: \"SuperNet\" and \"QuickLearner\". According to the description, the output should be in the format [\\\"model_name\\\"]. The presence of two model names in a nested array structure violates the required format, which specifies a single array of model names. The use of double square brackets suggests a nested array structure, which does not adhere to the format [\\\"model_name\\\"]. Therefore, this output does not comply with the description.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
