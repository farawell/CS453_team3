  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is given as [[\"SectorGAN\"]]. According to the chatbot description, the output should be an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. In this case, the output is presented in a nested array format [[\"model_name\"]] instead of the specified format [\"model_name\"]. This is a violation of the description, as the format does not directly adhere to the specified format requirements.\n\nThe explicit rule that is violated here is the format of the array in which the model names should be presented. The format should be a straightforward array with model names like [\"model_name\"], without additional nesting. Thus, the output does not comply with the description specifications. \n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
