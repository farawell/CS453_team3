The violation check requires verifying if \"DeepMoji\" is indeed a model name extracted from the given abstract input, but since the input is not provided, this check cannot be performed. As such, I can only assess whether the format is followed, which it is. Therefore, there is no additional violation based on the rules that can be checked without knowing the input.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
