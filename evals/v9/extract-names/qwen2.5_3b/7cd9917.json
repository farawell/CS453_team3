Since the task was to extract model names from machine learning paper abstracts, and an array with a potential model name is given, this output assumes compliance based on the format since the correctness of \"ModelWave\" being an actual model name can't be validated without the abstract input. Thus, based on format compliance, there is no rule violation.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
