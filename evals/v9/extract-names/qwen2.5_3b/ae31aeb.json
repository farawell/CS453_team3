  "complianceText": "The output from the chatbot is [[\"DQN\"]]. According to the task description, the chatbot is supposed to extract model names from machine learning paper abstracts and provide these names in the format [\"model_name\"]. If it cannot find any model names or is unsure, it should return [\"NA\"].\n\nLooking at the chatbot output, [[\"DQN\"]] seems to follow the required format as it is a name enclosed within double quotes inside an array. However, the format specified in the description is [\"model_name\"], which suggests a single array of strings rather than a nested array or an array with multiple entries; the given output has double square brackets. This deviation from the described format leads to non-compliance.\n\nThis output violates the described output format, which explicitly requires the model names to be in the format [\"model_name\"], and we are to consider [[\"DQN\"]] as not fitting this format due to its double brackets.\n\nERR"
