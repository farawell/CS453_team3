  "complianceText": "The requirement states that the response should be an array of model names in the format `[\"model_name\"]`. The output given is `[[\"BERT\"]]`, which does not comply due to an extra set of brackets. The correct format should involve only a single set of brackets encapsulating the model names as individual strings, like `[\"BERT\"]`.\n\nGiven that the output includes a nested array instead of a single array, this is a non-compliance with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
