According to the description, the correct format for the array should be [\"model_name\"], which suggests that it should contain strings directly, not arrays within an array. Additionally, the outer array structure as depicted in the chatbot output (double brackets) is not compliant with the description format. This is a structural error as the format of the array doesn't adhere to the requirements stated in the description.\n\nERR"
