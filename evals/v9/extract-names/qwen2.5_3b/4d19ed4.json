According to the description, if model names are extracted, they should be returned in this format, and the chatbot has adhered to this guideline. Since I am not tasked with checking the correctness of whether \"SoftGenie\" is indeed present in the input, I will only determine compliance based on format. The provided output complies with the description as there is no indication otherwise, and it respects the required formatting rules.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
