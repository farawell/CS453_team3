Since the description specifies that the response should be an array of model names, this output format is consistent with that requirement. There is no indication that these names were incorrect without the input abstract, and the presence of more than one model name in the array does not violate the description as long as they exist in the abstract. Therefore, the output complies with the given description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
