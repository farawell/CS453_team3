According to the description, the response should be an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. However, the chatbot output given is an array of arrays, where each model name is wrapped inside its own array. This does not comply with the specified format of a single array containing model names directly (i.e., [\"ModelA\", \"ModelB\", \"ModelC\"]).\n\nThis discrepancy constitutes a violation because the description specifically states the expected output format, and the chatbot has deviated from it by using nested arrays. \n\nERR"
