This output does not comply with the guidelines, as it is an array of arrays containing the model name instead of a single array containing the model name. The correct format according to the description should be a single array like [\"SparseTransformer\"].\n\nViolation: The output format is [\"SparseTransformer\"], but it is given as [[\"SparseTransformer\"]]. This indicates non-compliance with the output format rule specified in the description, which requires the response to be in the format [\"model_name\"].\n\nERR"
