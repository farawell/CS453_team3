This format is consistent with the requirement to produce an array of model names extracted from the abstract, provided as [\"model_name\"]. Since there is a model name in the array, the description's guideline of returning [\"NA\"] when no model names are found, or when unsure, does not apply here. The output adheres to the specified structure without requiring input analysis for verification.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
