According to the description, the expected output format is [\"model_name\"]. The output meets this requirement as it is formatted as a list with one model name enclosed in quotation marks. Since compliance with the specific format is what I am evaluating, and the chatbot's output satisfies this requirement, there is no apparent violation of the guidelines directly from the description provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
