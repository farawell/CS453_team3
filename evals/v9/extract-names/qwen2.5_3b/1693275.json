This format matches the expected output format [\"model_name\"] specified in the description. Since the description does not require verification of whether the name is indeed from the input given or correct (as the input is not available for checking), the output seems to comply with the provided description that asks for a format of array with model names, or [\"NA\"] if no model name is found or uncertain. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
