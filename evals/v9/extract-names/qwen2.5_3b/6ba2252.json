The output follows the format [\"model_name\"] as specified in the description, where multiple model names extracted are also allowed as it implies an array of model names can be returned if they exist. Without knowing the input, it's not possible to determine if the model names extracted are correct or actually present in the abstract, but that aspect of compliance is outside the scope of the checks I'm tasked with. Therefore, since the format is correct, it complies with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
