The structure of the output matches this requirement. \n\n- The output is an array, complying with the specified format.\n- It correctly uses [\"NA\"], which aligns with the instruction to return this when no model names are found or it is unknown.\n\nNo violations of the description can be detected based on the output alone, as the output format is consistent with the requirement.\n\nOK"
