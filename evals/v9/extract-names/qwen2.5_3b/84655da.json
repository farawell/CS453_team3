  "complianceText": "The chatbot description specifies the output should be an array of model names in the format `[\"model_name\"]`. If there are multiple model names, the output format as provided in the example is compliant with the description because it returns an array of model names as expected. There is no requirement that there should be a single model name in the output, so having multiple names in an array is within compliance. Since the validity of model names cannot be checked without knowing the input, based on the format alone, the output is in compliance.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
