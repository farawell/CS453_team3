There is no information provided to determine whether \"GraphSAGE\" is or isn't a model name from the abstract, but that is not required for this compliance check. The requirement is simply to have the names in an array, and if unsure, return [\"NA\"]. Since the output has adhered to the correct format and does not give any indication of uncertainty (which would require [\"NA\"]), it complies with the description guidelines.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
