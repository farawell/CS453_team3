According to the description, if model names are found in the abstract, they should be outputted in the format `[\"model_name\"]`. The output is compliant with this format. There is nothing in the output that indicates a violation of the description, as it does not require the input to determine compliance, only that an array is returned. The specific content of \"Transformers\" as a model name cannot be verified for correctness without the input, but compliance checks do not require that.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
