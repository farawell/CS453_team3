  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provided is [[\"BART\"]]. According to the description, the chatbot should output an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"] when model names are found in the abstract. The output [[\"BART\"]] suggests that there is a model name \"BART\" extracted. The key issue here is compliance with the required output format. The bot is expected to provide a single list of model names, with each model name enclosed in quotes. However, the provision of nested brackets is not in line with the expected format [\\\"model_name\\\"]. Instead the correct output should be [\"BART\"] as per the example in the rule mentioned [not [\"BART\"]].\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
