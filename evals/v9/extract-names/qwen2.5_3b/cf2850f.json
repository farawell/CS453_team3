The output should be a simple list with strings as elements, like [\"model_name1\", \"model_name2\"]. Here, the output is a nested array rather than a single list. This does not align with the expected format. The expected format is a single array of strings, while the provided output is an array containing another array. This discrepancy indicates a violation of the specified output format, leading to non-compliance with the description.\n\nERR"
