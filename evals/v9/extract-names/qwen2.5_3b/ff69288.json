The description dictates that an array of model names should be provided if detected, which is the case here. As I am not provided with the input (the abstract itself), I cannot determine whether \"Char-RNN\" is a part of it or not, but since it's formatted correctly as a model name, it complies with the guidelines. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
