  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is an array containing what appears to be a model name \"EfficientNet\". According to the description, the response should be an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. The response seems to be structured correctly as an array but without the exact input (the abstract), it is impossible to verify if \"EfficientNet\" is indeed a model name mentioned in the abstract. However, checking the correctness of the extracted model name requires knowing the input, which is not part of this compliance evaluation. Thus, there is no apparent violation of the format requirement described, and without the input, no violation of correctness can be identified.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
