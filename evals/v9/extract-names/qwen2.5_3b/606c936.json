According to the guidelines, the chatbot is to return [\"NA\"] if it does not find model names in the abstract or if it is not sure. Since I cannot verify if there were model names present in the abstract without the input, I must assume, based on the information given, that this output complies with the instructions. The output is in the correct format as specified in the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
