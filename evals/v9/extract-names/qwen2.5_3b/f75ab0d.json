This complies with the requirement of formatting model names in this way. Since the input abstract is not provided, I cannot determine that \"GalacticNet\" is or is not a model name extracted from the abstract. Thus, there is no violation of the rules based on the information provided. The output does not indicate uncertainty by using [\"NA\"], and the format given matches the expected format.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
