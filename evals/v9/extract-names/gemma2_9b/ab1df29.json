  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is an array with a model name \"NeRF\". This format adheres to the guideline that specifies the output should be an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. However, since I don't have access to the input abstract given to the chatbot, I cannot verify if \"NeRF\" is actually present in the abstract or not, but my evaluation is not concerned with correctness of extraction without input. As per the description, the guideline specifies returning [\"NA\"] if no model names are found or if unsure. The provided response format and conditions they fulfill align with the requirements in the absence of input context. Therefore, since the format is compliant, there is no rule violation to note here.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
