The format described is an array of model names, i.e., [\"model_name\"]. There is no need to evaluate for NA responses as the output contains a model name, potentially indicating that the bot extracted a model name from the input abstract. Since compliance does not require knowing the input, this output meets the requirements described.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
