The description states that if no model names are found, or there is uncertainty, the output should be `[\"NA\"]`. Since I cannot know the input (abstract), I cannot verify if \"HyperNetworks\" is a model name from the abstract. However, the output is in the correct format, and the description allows for returning found model names.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
