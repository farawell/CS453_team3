This complies with the guideline of extracting model names from the abstract. Since compliance with the requirement of returning an array of model name(s) is met, and I do not know the input to determine if this is correct or not, I will evaluate this based only on format and compliance with the description's output format. Hence, this output is compliant with the rules provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
