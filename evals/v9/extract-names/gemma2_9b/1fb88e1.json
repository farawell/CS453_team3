Since I cannot know the input (the abstract), I cannot evaluate whether these are correct model names extracted from the abstract. However, I can evaluate whether the output format complies with the description. The required format is an array of model names, which is precisely what the output is. Therefore, the format of the chatbot's output complies with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
