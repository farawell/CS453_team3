The given output, [\"CoVeR\"], adheres to this format. Since I don't have the input to check whether the model name extraction is functionally correct or evaluate whether \"CoVeR\" is indeed a model name from the provided abstract, I strictly adhere to the compliance directions. The output correctly follows the required format of an array containing one or more model names. Additionally, there is no contradictory information or additional content that violates the given description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
