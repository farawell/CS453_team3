The description specifies that the response should be an array of model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. This output appears to be formatted correctly as an array of model names, which aligns with the description requirements. Since the compliance check is about the format and not the correctness of the models, and given the current information, there is no indication of non-compliance in the output based on the rules specified without needing to know the input. Therefore, there are no violations.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
