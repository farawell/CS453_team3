The format appears to comply with the requirement of outputting an array with a model name. Since we do not have the input, we cannot determine if \"DeepMoji\" was actually present or correctly extracted from the input abstract. However, based on the format, it seems to comply with providing model names or \"NA\". Thus, without additional context on the input, the output adheres to the guidelines provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
