If there are no model names, the expected output should be `[\"NA\"]`. In this case, the output provided is `[\"SmartPredictor\", \"TrendExtractor\"]`, which complies with the specified format of an array. There is no way to assess whether these names were present in the abstract, hence the output is compliant with the description without knowing the input.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
