According to the description, if a model name is extracted from a machine learning paper abstract, it should be formatted as an array with one or multiple model names. The output aligns with that guideline. There is no information suggesting that there should not be a model name, and as this does not require input knowledge, the output is compliant with the requirements provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
