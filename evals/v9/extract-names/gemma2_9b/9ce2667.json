  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is `[\"NA\"]`. According to the description, if the chatbot does not find any model names in the abstract or is not sure, it should return `[\"NA\"]`. The additional text \"Let me know if you'd like me to try with another abstract!\" is not mentioned in the description as part of the expected output and should not be included. This additional text deviates from the specified format.\n\nThis leads to a violation because the description clearly specifies that only an array of the model names in the format `[\"model_name\"]` should be returned, with no supplementary text. \n\nThe decision based on this evaluation is:\nERR"
