The output does not contain any additional information or format deviations. Since I'm not aware of whether this is an actual model name from the abstract's input, I'm not considering its correctness regarding the provided task, only its compliance. There is no requirement based on the provided description that can be checked without knowing the input that has been violated. Thus, no violations are detected.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
