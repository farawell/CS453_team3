  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output follows the format specified in the description. It extracts \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes\" separately, each category labeled correctly. The extracted entities are presented as comma-separated lists, even when the list contains only one item. The categories without extracted entities (i.e., \"People names\") are left blank, maintaining consistency with the specified format.\n\nThere is no textual content outside of the format, except an additional closing statement \"Let me know if you'd like me to analyze any other text!\" However, this does not interfere with the structured output format described. The statement is separate and is not part of the entity extraction format.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
