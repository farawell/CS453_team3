  "complianceText": "The output is evaluated based on the following elements from the description:\n\n1. **Format Compliance**: The output should follow the format specified in the description. The format requires:\n   - \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\"\n   - \"People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>\"\n   - \"Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_specific_topics>\"\n   - \"General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_general_themes>\"\n\nThe output does not comply with the specified format. Instead of following the required format, it provides descriptions and classifies them into bullets without using a comma-separated list, which is a direct non-compliance with the required format.\n\n2. **Content Compliance**: Without the input text, content evaluation for correctness cannot be performed. However, structural compliance is key and the output violates the template format.\n\nGiven these observations, my decision is based on the clear formatting violation.\n\nThere is a concrete format violation regarding the list format required by the description.\nERR"
