  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the output is based on the given description's criteria:\n\n1. **Format**: The chatbot uses the required format for extraction outputs: \"Company names\", \"People names\", \"Specific topics\", and \"General themes,\" each followed by a colon and a list. The list for \"Company names\" is empty, but this does not violate the description as the description requires extracting \"all company names\", which implies that there may be none to extract. The \"People names\" section contains a placeholder \"-||-\", which matches the expected formatting.\n\n2. **Compliance with Extraction Order**: The order of categories is correct as it follows \"Company names,\" \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes\" as instructed.\n\n3. **Completeness**: Considering the format and sequence are adhered to, and given there is no elaboration on entities that have not been extracted, the current output does not violate any aspects that can be evaluated without knowing the input.\n\nThe considerations of the evaluation process led to finding no issues with the format or ordering as per the description. No requirements were violated in the format, structure, or sequence of the output as specified in the task guidelines.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
