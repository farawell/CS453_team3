According to the chatbot description, the output should list entities in four categories: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. All categories should have a comma-separated list of names/topics/themes or be left empty as appropriate.\n\n1. **Company names:** The format here is correct with company names listed as a comma-separated list, which complies with the description.\n\n2. **People names:** This section is present, but it is left empty without a placeholder like \"-||-\", which is indicated in the desired format to signal that there are no people names to list. This is a non-compliance with the format description.\n\n3. **Specific topics:** The specific topics are presented in compliance with a comma-separated format.\n\n4. **General themes:** These are correctly presented as well in a comma-separated format.\n\nThere is a violation due to the missing placeholder \"-||-\" for the \"People names\" section. The format required by the guideline was not strictly followed.\n\nERR"
