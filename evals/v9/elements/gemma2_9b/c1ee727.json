  "complianceText": "The chatbot output follows the format prescribed in the description. However, there is a notable violation: the \"People names\" field is missing the required comma-separated list format. Although it is empty, it should still adhere to the specified format, for example, by including an empty list indicator such as a dash or 'None'. This omission suggests a lack of strict compliance even if it's empty. \n\nGiven that the rest of the structure is correct but doesn't strictly adhere to the empty list format in \"People names,\" I conclude that there has been a compliance oversight.\n\nERR"
