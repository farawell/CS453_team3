According to the specified format in the description, the chatbot should list entities under four distinct categories: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, in the provided output, the sections for \"Company names\" and \"People names\" are left empty, which implies missing information.\n\nThe output should explicitly list entries for all four categories, even if it means specifying 'None' or 'N/A' in those categories where no entities are available. This lapse in following the specified output format leads to non-compliance with the description.\n\nThe specific elements that led to the conclusion of non-compliance are the empty lists for \"Company names\" and \"People names,\" which indicate that the format was not strictly adhered to.\n\nERR"
