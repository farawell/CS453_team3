While it's possible that there were no company or people entities in the text, the description requires that if these entities are missing, it should still be noted that there are none, rather than leaving it blank. Therefore, there should have been a specific indicator like \"None\" or left them listed as empty but marked with appropriate formatting (e.g., a comma-separated list that is simply empty).\n\nAdditionally, the output slightly deviates from the format because after the headings \"Company names:\" and \"People names:\", it should have some indication even if there are no entities. Leaving these sections entirely blank can be seen as a formatting omission per the guidelines, which is taken as a violation.\n\nERR"
