  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides a breakdown of extracted entities according to different categories: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. However, the output violates the required format specified in the description. The required format is to list the entities in a comma-separated list form, prefixed with respective category headings (e.g., \"Company names:\", \"People names:\"). Instead, the output uses bullet points and provides narrative commentary, which deviates from the specified format.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n- The format does not follow the exact structure \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\", \"People names: -||-\", \"Specific topics: -||-\", and \"General themes: -||-\".\n- The output includes additional commentary/opinion (\"You've done a great job...\", \"The format is clear and accurate...\", etc.), which is not prescribed in the description.\n\nThese observations lead to the conclusion that the output does not comply with the specified format in the description.\n\nERR"
