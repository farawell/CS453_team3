  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is meant to be evaluated based on whether it matches the required format and description provided. \n\n1. **Format Compliance**: The output does not follow the required format strictly. The description specifies that the lists should be comma-separated and presented in a single line for each category.\n\n2. **Company names** were required to be presented as a 'comma_separated_list_of_company_names'. Instead, they are presented in bullet-point format, which does not comply with the specified format.\n\n3. **People names** are presented correctly as missing, though ideally it should explicitly state something like \"People names: \" to maintain consistency.\n\n4. **Specific topics** and **General themes** are also not in the comma-separated format, and they too are listed as bullet points instead.\n\nDue to these formatting issues, the output does not comply with the description. The thinking process focuses on identifying these discrepancies between the required format and the actual output provided by the chatbot.\n\nERR"
