  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is largely compliant with the described format in the chatbot description. The output presents \"Company names\" as specified, listing \"Google.\" Under \"People names,\" nothing is mentioned, which is acceptable given there might not be any people names in the text. The “Specific topics” and “General themes” sections also adhere to the expected format by listing topics (\"device innovation\") and themes (\"technological advancements,\" \"company performance\") in comma-separated formats.\n\nHowever, there is a minor deviation. All lists should follow the consistent format of being comma-separated, including \"Company names\" which only has one entry, it should either use a comma after 'Google', or none of the sections should have a trailing comma after the last item. While this is not explicitly detrimental to understanding, it doesn't strictly comply with the format's expectation of consistent list formatting.\n\nTherefore, although the list formatting is not entirely consistent across all fields, it doesn't largely disrupt the intended format.\n\nNo major violation.\nOK"
