However, in the \"People names\" category, it uses \"-||-\" instead of leaving it empty or explicitly stating that there are no people names mentioned. This format differs slightly from the rest of the output which uses commas to separate items or leaves the section empty. This inconsistency is a deviation from the described output format.\n\nERR"
