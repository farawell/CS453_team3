  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot does not fully comply with the specified format described in the guidelines. Here is my reasoning:\n- While the chatbot correctly lists the entity type \"Company names\" with \"Blue Whale,\" the \"People names\" section should explicitly list names or show empty with the placeholder \"-||-\". However, since no names are mentioned, the placeholder \"-||-\" is correctly placed.\n- The \"Specific topics\" section is filled with \"marine conservation,\" which is acceptable if this is a specific topic from the text.\n- The \"General themes\" section lists \"discussions, names.\" However, these do not fit the general theme category. Themes should be broader and more conceptual rather than literal terms or categories.\n\nThe primary violation is in the \"General themes\" section, where the listed items do not fit the idea of overarching themes. Therefore, the output does not fully comply with the guidelines.\n\nERR"
