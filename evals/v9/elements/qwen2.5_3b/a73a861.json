  "complianceText": "The output does not fully comply with the specified format from the description. There is a missing comma separating different specific topics and general themes, and there is also a missing delimiter '-||-' for people names and general themes in the output. The lack of these delimiters is a violation of the required format:\n\n1. For \"People names,\" the output shows a newline instead of -||-, which does not match the required format.\n2. The \"General themes\" section correctly places content, however, the delimiter 'General themes: -||-' is used after content instead of before and also the delimiter at the end '-||-' is missing.\n3. In the \"Specific topics,\" the output does not include a comma-separated format. The correct compliance would require ensuring that all items in \"Specific topics\" are separated by commas.\n4. The absence of '-||-' after People Names and General Themes is an explicit violation of the rules.\n5. \"General themes\" should be listed first, then followed by -||-, according to the description's format.\n\nDue to these violations, the output does not fully comply with the description.\nERR"
