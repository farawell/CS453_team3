The format structure is followed properly with each category clearly labeled: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. However, there is a potential issue with the \"Company names\" category. The term `<no_company_names>` is not a valid list or representation, as the template requires a comma-separated list. In cases where there are no entities to list, it would be more accurate to simply leave the field empty after the colon, rather than using a placeholder that doesn't match the format expectation. Additionally, the output for \"People names\": Ludwig van Beethoven should preferably be in a comma-separated format even for a single entity. Therefore, there is a non-compliance with the description regarding the format of the output.\n\nERR"
