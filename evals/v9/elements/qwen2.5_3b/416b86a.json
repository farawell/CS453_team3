However, there is a compliance issue because the \"People names\" section is not formatted correctly. According to the description, there should be a comma-separated list, but instead, it uses a dash indicating no names, which is inconsistent with the expected format. \n\nFor consistency with the expected format, the dash should be removed to match how an empty list is depicted in other sections, assuming there are truly no people names mentioned.\n\nThis non-compliance with formatting is sufficient to classify this output as errant per the guidelines.\n\nERR"
