The instructions imply the use of \"-||-\" as a placeholder for lists, demonstrated in \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" and \"People names: -||-\", indicating that it expected the same format for all the sections when no entities are present.\n\nBecause of this deviation from the example format, the output does not entirely comply with the description provided.\n\nERR"
