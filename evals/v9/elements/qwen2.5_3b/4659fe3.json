  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides four categories as requested: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. The \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections use the specified delimiter \"<empty>\" and \"-||-\", respectively. The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections adequately list items separated by commas. However, there is a discrepancy where the \"Company names\" section uses \"<empty>\" instead of the specified delimiter \"-||-\", which is used for non-listed entities. This deviates from the required format.\n\nThe guidelines explicitly require the company names to be presented as a comma-separated list and, in the absence of any names, to follow the same delimiter format as the others (\"-||-\"). The use of \"<empty>\" is non-compliant with this aspect of the description.\n\nERR"
