  "complianceText": "The chatbot output should comply with the format and order dictated by the description. Upon evaluating the provided output, there is a violation of the desired format. Specifically, for \"Company names\" the placeholder \"<no_company_names_present>\" does not match the \"<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\" format outlined in the description. The term \"<no_company_names_present>\" looks informal compared to the placeholder defined in the description which should consistently use a comma-separated list, even if empty. \n\nAdditionally, while the \"People names\" field uses the correct placeholder \"-||-\", the description isn't clear on how to handle cases with no entities found, but a consistent approach is required as shown in other examples.\n\nGiven these points, there is a violation based on the placeholder used in the \"Company names\" field not complying explicitly with the format guideline.\n\nERR"
