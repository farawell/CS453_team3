Furthermore, for people names, the same format issue is present with the inclusion of \"-||-\". The description does not specify using \"<no_company_names>\" or \"-||-\" in case of absence of the entities. Additionally, there are no quotation marks or angle brackets for company names and people names sections, which could be considered as a minor discrepancy from the format, but the most evident compliance issue remains the handling of absence of entities.\n\nERR"
