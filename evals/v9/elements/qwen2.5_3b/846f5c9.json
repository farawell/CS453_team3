  "complianceText": "The chatbot output lists \"Amazon, Netflix, Jeff Bezos\" under \"Company names\". However, \"Jeff Bezos\" is a person's name, not a company. Including it in the \"Company names\" list violates the description which clearly states to extract company names and people names separately. Furthermore, \"Jeff Bezos\" is appropriately listed under \"People names\". This inconsistency in categorization reflects a failure to adhere to the provided format and instructions. Therefore, based on this non-compliance, the chatbot's output does not align with the description.\n\nERR"
