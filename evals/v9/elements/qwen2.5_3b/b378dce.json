  "complianceText": "The chatbot output includes the sections as specified in the desired format, but there is a discrepancy with how the chatbot handles the \"Company names\" section. According to the description, the format for empty lists in each of the categories should be \"-||-\" as demonstrated by the \"People names\" field. However, the output for \"Company names\" does not follow this specified format, and instead uses \"<no_company_names>\".\n\nMoreover, the \"People names\" section does not follow the comma-separated list format: it lists only one name without using commas, which implies a misunderstanding of the expected output formatting when there is more than one name. \n\nDue to these format discrepancies, the output does not comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
