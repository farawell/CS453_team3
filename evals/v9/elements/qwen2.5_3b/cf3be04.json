  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output mostly adheres to the format specified in the description, with the exception of the \"Company names\" field. The correct placeholder should be \"<no_company_names>\" instead of the empty list format indicated by the absence of company names in the provided output. The placeholder used in the output does not align with the format described, as the description requires a comma-separated list, even if that list is empty, implying it should be \"Company names: \" with no content following it if there are no company names, or alternatively using a correct placeholder that signifies no names like \"<none>\" if that fits within some initialized optional placeholder logic.\n\nTherefore, based on this evaluation, the output does not strictly adhere to the format specified in the description.\n\nERR"
