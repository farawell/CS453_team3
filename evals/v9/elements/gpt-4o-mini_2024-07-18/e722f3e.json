The output is formatted correctly, with each category separated by a colon. The separator '-||-' is correctly used following the \"People names\" category, where there is presumably no data to enter. Other categories are populated with comma-separated lists where applicable.\n\nMy evaluation leads to the conclusion that the output maintains compliance with the structure needed. It adheres to the guidelines provided in the description, breaking the covered entities into the specified categories as required by the guidelines. Additionally, the use of a consistent format further supports compliance.\n\nNo violation.\n\nOK"
