  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot output follows these steps:\n\n1. **Desired Format and Structure**: The chatbot description specifies a structured format with four categories: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. Each category should be followed by a list of items, formatted as a comma-separated list. The chatbot output adheres to this format.\n\n2. **Sequence of Categories**: The output maintains the required sequence: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. The chatbot output follows this sequence as described.\n\n3. **Item Presentation**: Each category in the output is presented on a separate line with a clear title, as required. The items within specific categories are appropriately listed. In this case, the Specific topics and General themes contain multiple entries, all of which are separated by commas or spaces, matching the intended list style.\n\nThere seems to be no deviation from the prescribed format. All four categories are present, listed in the correct order, and the items are presented as expected. Therefore, since the output complies with the structure and format specified in the description without requiring input context for evaluation, it fully adheres to the provided guidelines.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
