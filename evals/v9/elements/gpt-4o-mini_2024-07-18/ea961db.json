  "complianceText": "The chatbot output adheres closely to the desired format specified in the description, listing the extracted entities in distinct categories. However, there seems to be a potential issue with the format used for listing multiple items, specifically the use of commas to separate multiple entities in each category. For \"Company names\" and \"People names,\" the format seems to follow this rule with a single entity each. The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" categories also appear to follow the presumed rule for listing multiple itemsâ€”using commas to separate them. However, the description does not explicitly state the need to label categories with bullet-style list indicators \"-||-\" as utilized in the categories other than \"Company names.\" As per the guidelines, my decision is based purely on compliance with instructions provided, and since there are no instructions to label categories in alternative ways like \"-||-\", the current output is fully compliant in terms of its structure. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
