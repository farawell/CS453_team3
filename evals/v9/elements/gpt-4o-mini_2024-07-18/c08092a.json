However, there is a missing entry for the \"Company names\" category, where an explicit entry should be present even if it's \"None\" or similar, as in other categories when applicable. Since the format compliance is needed for evaluation, this absence constitutes a deviation from the precise description guidelines. Therefore, this aspect is not in compliance with the chatbot's description.\n\nERR"
