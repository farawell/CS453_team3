  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the chatbot description because the \"Company names\" and \"People names\" sections are empty, indicated by \"Company names: \" and \"People names: -||-\". According to the desired format, both should contain a comma-separated list of names if applicable. If nothing is extracted, it should explicitly reflect as an empty list such as \"None\" or similar indication, not suggesting a continuation or missing information. Additionally, the format lacks explicit delimiters for the empty company names section, which should match the format for non-extracted names as seen in \"People names: -||-\".\n\nThe \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections, however, are filled properly with a comma-separated list of items. Nonetheless, the lack of any indication or delimiter for \"Company names\" other than a missing comma-separated list shows non-compliance with the description, causing inconsistency in format adherence.\n\nERR"
