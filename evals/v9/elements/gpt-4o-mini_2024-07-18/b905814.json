  "complianceText": "The chatbot output correctly follows the prescribed format which was outlined in the description. It begins with \"Company names:\" followed by a comma-separated list of company names, although there is only one in this case. Then, \"People names:\" is correctly annotated before the list of people names. Likewise, it enumerates \"Specific topics:\" and \"General themes:\" before listing the relevant topics and themes.\n\nThere is no structural deviation from the required output format as each list is presented under the appropriate heading. The lists are not empty, and each section is clearly demarcated as required.\n\nSince the evaluation of content correctness is not within the scope (as it requires knowing the input), the evaluation of compliance is strictly focused on adherence to the format.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
