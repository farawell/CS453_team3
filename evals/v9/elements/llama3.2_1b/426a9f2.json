The conference addressed urban mobility challenges and smart city initiatives. There was a considerable focus on electric vehicles, shared transportation networks, and the regulatory landscape. The overarching theme was the future of urban mobility.\"\n\nCompany names: Uber Technologies Inc.  \nPeople names: Dara Khosrowshahi  \nSpecific topics: Urban mobility challenges, smart city initiatives, electric vehicles, shared transportation networks  \nGeneral themes: Future of urban mobility",
  "output": "Here are the extracted entities:\n\n**Company Names:** Uber Technologies Inc.\n- Dara Khosrowshahi\n**People Names:** -||-\n**Specific Topics:** Urban mobility challenges, smart city initiatives, electric vehicles, shared transportation networks\n**General Themes:** -||-",

  "complianceText": "In evaluating the provided chatbot output, there are a few elements that do not comply with the description. According to the chatbot description, the extraction should be formatted as follows:\n\n1. **Order and Structure**: The desired structure specifies the order and labeling format precisely: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. The output must use the exact format: \"Company names:\", \"People names:\", \"Specific topics:\", \"General themes:\" followed by a comma-separated list or \"-||-\" if the category is empty. \n\n2. **Separator Format**: For empty categories, the output should use the placeholder \"-||-\". The output provided mistakenly places a person name under company names and does not include the necessary placeholders for the empty \"People names\" and \"General Themes\" sections, which should be \"-||-\".\n\n3. **Formatting Errors**: The formatting for Company names was incorrect: it included the person's name after a bullet point which is not compliant. Also, the absence of specific themes is incorrectly formatted because it does not follow the pattern specified, which requires the '-||-' placeholder.\n\n4. **Content Placement**: The name \"Dara Khosrowshahi\", which is a person name, was incorrectly listed under \"Company Names\".\n\nBased on these observations, the output does not comply with the given description, specifically due to incorrect formatting, incorrect placement of extracted entities, and the improper use of separators for empty entity lists.\n\nERR"
