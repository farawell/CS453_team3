  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description for two reasons. First, under \"Company names,\" it incorrectly lists a person, \"Albert Bourla,\" in conjunction with a company name. The format should only contain company names, so including a personâ€™s name violates the structure. Second, under \"Specific topics,\" the list includes individual entries with a hyphen, with \"Innovation in precision medicine\" mentioned as both a specific topic and a general theme, which is unclear for determining category appropriateness solely based on information provided. \n\nThere should be more consistency and clarity in delineating \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes,\" according to the structure guidelines. Each category should clearly differentiate between narrower specific topics and broader general themes, ensuring no overlap of content and maintaining distinct categorization without knowing the input.\n\nERR"
