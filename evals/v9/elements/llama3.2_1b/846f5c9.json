According to the guidelines, the output must strictly follow the prescribed structure:\n- \"Company names\" must be followed by a comma-separated list, and \"None mentioned in the given information\" does not adhere to this requirement.\n- There is a list format for people names, but no company names are stated.\n- \"People names\" is correctly followed by a list.\n- \"Specific topics\" is correctly followed by a list.\n- \"General themes\" is correctly followed by a description.\n\nThe primary issue is with the \"Company names\" format. The use of \"None mentioned in the given information\" deviates from the required format of a simple list, even if empty, such as using \"None\" without additional wording. \n\nTherefore, despite the proper format for other sections, the violation in the \"Company names\" section leads to non-compliance with the given description.\n\nERR"
