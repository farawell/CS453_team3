  "complianceText": "The chatbot output begins by listing the extracted company names as \"Google\" and people names as \"Sundar Pichai.\" Then, it mentions \"None found\" for specific topics, while listing the general themes as \"Technology, Engineering, Business, Innovation.\" The format of the output aligns with the expected format described: a comma-separated list for each category, with each category labeled appropriately. Importantly, the output respects the ordering: company names first, followed by people names, specific topics, and general themes. There is no requirement in the guidelines indicating a specific number of entities to extract, nor a requirement for specific content in the entities provided, meaning that \"None found\" is acceptable where relevant. Therefore, the structure and format comply with the given chatbot description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
