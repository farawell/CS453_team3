According to the description, each category should be followed by a comma-separated list, and when there are no entities to list, it should be represented with '-||-'. The output for 'People Names' uses \"-||-\" correctly, but then deviates by adding an additional explanatory note, which is inconsistent with the expected format.\n\nAdditionally, for the 'Company Names', there is an appended note that deviates from the required format after listing company names. Furthermore, the 'General Themes' section does not follow the specified separator format '-||-', as no list is separated by commas or formatted appropriately.\n\nThe output should strictly follow the desired format without additional explanatory notes or deviations. The presence of explanations within the lists and alternate separators indicates a formatting non-compliance.\n\nERR"
