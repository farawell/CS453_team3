  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the described format. According to the given description, company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes should each be presented as a comma-separated list. However, the list of company names and people names is not in a comma-separated format; instead, they are vertically listed. Specific topics are incorrectly presented as a list in bullet points instead of a comma-separated list, and general themes are missing entirely. The reasoning that led me to this conclusion is a straightforward comparison between the chatbot's output format and the required format in the description.\n\nERR"
