Each category (Company names, People names, Specific topics, General themes) should be clearly listed.\n2. For each category, items should be separated by commas where necessary. In this case, the issue arises with \"Company names\" which are formatted incorrectly since the only listed company, \"SpaceX\", is enclosed with dashes instead of being a simple comma-separated list. While listing, it should remain as 'SpaceX' without the enclosed dashes.\n\nGiven the direct non-compliance in the format of the \"Company names\" section, this violates the description's format requirement.\n\nViolation: In the \"Company names\" section, \"SpaceX\" is incorrectly formatted with dashes around it. The correct format is a comma-separated list without additional characters.\n\nERR"
