  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is in partial compliance with the description provided. It correctly identifies the sections for Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes, which is in line with the desired format. However, the People names section should use a comma-separated list or indicate 'None' explicitly if no people names are mentioned. Instead, it shows \"-|->\", which is not the expected format described. As per the guidelines, even though there might be a correct interpretation of the input possibly resulting in having 'None mentioned' for Company names, the expected formatting should be followed strictly for all sections.\n\nThe violation lies solely in the formatting of the People names section.\n\nERR"
