  "complianceText": "The evaluation of the chatbot output against the provided description reveals one violation. According to the description, the extracted entities should be presented in a format that matches \"Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>\". However, the chatbot uses a bullet point style with double asterisks rather than strictly following the required format. It uses \"**Company Names:**\" instead of \"Company names:\" and employs a bullet point style (marked by double asterisks for emphasis) instead of a simple positional separation by a colon.\n\nTherefore, this format deviation leads me to a decision of non-compliance. Specifically, the output missed compliance in not following the exact textual format as detailed, which is essential regardless of the correctness of the extracted entities themselves. \n\nERR"
