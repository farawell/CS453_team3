The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections are also included, with each topic and theme listed on separate lines. However, there is a disparity in how the list items are separated. While the description suggests a comma-separated list, the output uses line breaks with dashes for some listings. This deviation suggests non-compliance as the format description explicitly seeks a comma-separated list.\n\nERR"
