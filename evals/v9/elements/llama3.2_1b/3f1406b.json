  "complianceText": "The chatbot output lists the extracted entities as required by the description. However, the format does not fully comply with the given requirements. According to the description, each category of entities (company names, people names, specific topics, general themes) should be presented as a comma-separated list rather than a list where each item starts on a new line with a dash. Additionally, the general themes section includes a note similar to what is included in the specific topics, which deviates from the plain listing required by the description.\n\nTherefore, the output violates the format rule specified in the description: each category must be presented as a comma-separated list. The presence of notes is also not mentioned in the description.\n\nERR"
