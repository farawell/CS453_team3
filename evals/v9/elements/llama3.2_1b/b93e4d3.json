  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description provided for several reasons. Firstly, the \"People names\" section uses the placeholder \"-||-\" instead of listing names or leaving it empty, which is not the format specified in the guidelines. Additionally, the \"General themes\" section lacks the required format, as it does not separate individual themes with commas. Terms such as \"Environmentalsustainabilitypurchase PracticesEconomyCommerce\" appear concatenated without any separators, making it difficult to discern distinct themes. According to the description, the chatbot should present a comma-separated list in this section. These issues indicate that the output does not adhere to the specified format.\n\nERR"
