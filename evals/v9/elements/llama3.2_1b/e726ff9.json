For people names, it lists \"Mike Wirth,\" appearing under the correct heading. The specific topics mentioned are listed under \"Specific topics\" and similarly, the overarching theme is listed under \"General themes.\"\n\nThe format follows the exact structure outlined:\n- \"Company names\" first.\n- \"People names\" second.\n- \"Specific topics\" third.\n- \"General themes\" last.\n\nThere doesnâ€™t appear to be a violation in the output as it adheres to the labeling and sequence described in the guidelines provided. It clearly separates the types of extracted entities into appropriate categories. That's why it complies with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
