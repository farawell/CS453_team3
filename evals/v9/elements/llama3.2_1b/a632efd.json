  "input": "Text: The collaborative work between IBM and academia on AI ethics was highlighted by John Doe.",
  "output": "Company names: <none>\nPeople names:\n- John Doe\nSpecific topics: -||-\nGeneral themes: Collaboration, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Ethics",
  "compliance": "err",
  "complianceText": "There are a few points of non-compliance in this output:\n\n1. **Company Names Format**: The format specified for company names is a comma-separated list within angle brackets, i.e., '<comma_separated_list_of_company_names>'. The output correctly uses '<none>' indicating no company names found. There is no issue here.\n\n2. **People Names List**: The format specified for listing people names is also as a comma-separated list within angle brackets '-||-'. However, the output lists 'John Doe' without using angle brackets or a comma-separated format, which does not adhere to the specified format.\n\n3. **Specific Topics Format**: The expected format for specific topics is '-||-'. This part adheres to the format, indicating no specific topics were extracted.\n\n4. **General Themes List**: The format again specified is to list items in a comma-separated format within angle brackets. However, the general themes are listed without the angle brackets, which deviates from the expected format.\n\nDue to these non-compliance points with the specified format (for people names and general themes), the output does not fully comply with the description.\n\nERR"
