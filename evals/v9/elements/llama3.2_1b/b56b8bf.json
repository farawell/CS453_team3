For \"Company names,\" the instruction is to provide a comma-separated list. The output provides \"None mentioned,\" which can be ambiguous, but it may be considered compliant as it indicates absence.\n\n2. For \"People names,\" the output uses \"-||-\" exactly as specified in the description when there are no names to list, which is compliant.\n\n3. The \"Specific topics\" and \"General themes\" sections are filled with entries in a comma-separated format, adhering to the instructions in the description.\n\nSince the output follows the described format for all sections and categories, I see no violations. It complies with the format even when there are no entries (using \"None mentioned\" and \"-||-\"). \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
