However, they are provided first, whereas the description specifies the order to be company names, people names, specific topics, and then general themes.\n\n4. Specific topics: The output does not mention any specific topics, which violates the format requirements. Even if there are no specific topics to mention, a placeholder should be provided to indicate that none were extracted.\n\nThe main violations are the omission of specific topics and the order of elements in the output. According to guideline 4, these omissions and deviations from the required order constitute non-compliance.\n\nERR"
