  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not fully comply with the description:\n\n1. **Formatting**: The output does not adhere to the specified format. The expected format is a comma-separated list for each category, but the chatbot uses bullet points instead for \"Company names\" and \"People names\".\n\n2. **Company Names**: There is only one entry under \"Company names\", and it includes additional information \"(no company affiliation mentioned)\", which is not compliant with the format provided in the description. The description specifies a simple comma-separated list without additional information.\n\n3. **People Names**: The output states \"None mentioned\", which isn't compliant with the description's format. The expected format when none are found is uncertain from the description, but it should ideally follow the same structural pattern as lists.\n\n4. **General Themes**: The format of listing general themes as \"Symbolism, -\" is not conforming to the format outlined, which suggests using a comma-separated list.\n\nBased on these observations, the output does not comply with the specified format in several areas.\n\nERR"
