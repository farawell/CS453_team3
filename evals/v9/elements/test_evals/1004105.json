The section \"Company names\" is left empty, but according to the format provided, it should at least reflect that the section is intentionally empty if there are indeed no company names mentioned. This might be presented as `Company names: None` or `Company names: -` or a similar indication that no company names were found, to ensure clarity and adherence to format.\n\nBased on the above observation, the output deviates from the expected format, and therefore, it does not fully comply with the described requirements.\n\nERR",
