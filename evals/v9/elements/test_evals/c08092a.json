  "coverageEvalText": "The provided output does not comply with the description in terms of correctly formatting and structuring the output as prescribed. \n\n1. The section for \"Company names\" has been left blank, which means that the format was not followed as expected. According to the description, there should have been comma-separated values or at least acknowledgment of \"none\" if there were no company names.\n\n2. The format for People names, Specific topics, and General themes is provided correctly. They are listed after a colon and separated by commas where applicable.\n\n3. The issue lies with the Company names section not following the desired format.\n\nTherefore, my decision is based on the non-compliance of the \"Company names\" field format, which leads me to conclude that the output does not fully comply with the description.\n\nERR",
