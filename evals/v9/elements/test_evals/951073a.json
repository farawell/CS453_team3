  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output does not comply fully with the given description. The guidelines specify that the output should list entities in the following order: company names, people names, specific topics, and general themes. For \"Company names,\" the chatbot has left the section empty but still included the label. While it may be that there were no company names to list, presenting an empty label without explanation might be considered a formatting issue according to strict compliance with the description. Therefore, the presence of an empty section for company names indicates a subtle non-compliance with the expectation of the output format as it should clearly indicate if there are no company names.\n\nThe output otherwise adheres to the sequence and labeling format required: people names are listed under \"People names,\" specific topics under \"Specific topics,\" and general themes under \"General themes.\" However, the empty \"Company names\" section should either be omitted or a notation like \"None\" should be used for clarity according to a meticulous interpretation of desired format compliance.\n\nERR",
