  "validityText": "The input text provided is \"The abstract concept of Love has inspired countless works and discussions.\" According to the input specification, the text can include general overarching themes and specific topics related to the content. The abstract concept of love fits both of these categories—it is a general theme and a specific topic that has been the subject of many works and discussions. Additionally, the input specifies that the text should be in a human-readable format and understandable language. The sentence provided meets these criteria as it is grammatically correct and easy to understand. The text does not include names of companies or people, but the specification does not require all these elements to be present—just that they can be. Therefore, there is no violation of the input specification, as the text is coherent, complete enough to contain a relevant entity (in this case, love), and understandable.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The output format provided by the chatbot is consistent with the desired format outlined in the description. However, there's a notable discrepancy in the section for \"Company names\" and \"People names.\" According to the description, these should be presented as comma-separated lists, but the output has left these sections blank. Even if no entities exist, the format should be correctly filled with appropriate placeholders or indications. Specific topics and general themes are mentioned as required.\n\nBased on this analysis, the missing names or placeholders for company names and people names constitutes a violation of the format requirement.\n\nERR",
