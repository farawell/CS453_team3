  "coverageEvalText": "The evaluation of the chatbot output begins with checking if it adheres to the desired format and order as outlined in the description.\n\n1. **Company Names**: The output begins with \"Company names:\" followed by an empty space. This is compliant with the format, as the description does not mandate the presence of any entities but specifies their order when they appear.\n\n2. **People Names**: The output follows by listing \"People names:\" with no entries afterwards. This also adheres to the format since, similar to company names, the list can be empty.\n\n3. **Specific Topics**: The output lists \"Specific topics: 5G development, smart city infrastructure\", which matches the desired format of a comma-separated list following the heading for specific topics.\n\n4. **General Themes**: The output lists \"General themes: technology, urban development, innovation\". This corresponds with the format of a comma-separated list of themes following the heading for general themes.\n\nThe entire output adheres to the specified structure, with headings and lists presented in the correct order without any content that appears out of place or missing given the guidelines. Furthermore, each category explicitly follows the headings, ensuring clarity regarding what information is listed.\n\nThere are no violations of format or order. The output properly lists each category in sequence and follows every heading with an appropriate list, even if empty, maintaining compliance with the chatbot's description. \n\nNo violation.\nOK",
