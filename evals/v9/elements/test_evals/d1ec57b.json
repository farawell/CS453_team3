  "validityText": "The input is a block of text, which is similar to the example given. Upon examination, it contains the name of a company (Facebook), a specific topic (social media's role in modern communications), and is in a human-readable and understandable language. The text does not need to contain names of people, but it meets other aspects of the input specification. There are no length constraints, and the content seems complete enough to contain relevant entities. There are no violations of the input specifications.\n\nOK",

  "coverageText": "Company names: Facebook\nPeople names: \nSpecific topics: social media, modern communications\nGeneral themes: technology, communication, social media influence",
  "coverageEvalText": "The output provided by the chatbot partially complies with the description. It follows the desired format by listing \"Company names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes.\" However, it misses the \"People names\" section, which should at least be present even if there are no names to list (potentially represented as 'None' or simply left empty).\n\nThinking through the guidelines, the non-compliance stems from not properly handling an empty list for \"People names.\" The chatbot should maintain all sections as stipulated in the format, even if there is no content to list.\n\nErroneous List Representation:\n\n- The section for \"People names\" exists but has no appropriate indication of an empty list, which is misleading.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the reasoning and detailed explanation, the output fails to meet the complete expected format as per the chatbot description. \n\nERR",
