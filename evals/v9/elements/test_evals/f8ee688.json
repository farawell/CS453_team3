  "coverageEvalText": "The evaluation of the chatbot output should be based on the provided description. The output format contains four categories: Company names, People names, Specific topics, and General themes. Letâ€™s evaluate each component:\n\n1. **Company names:** The output lists \"Google Cloud,\" which assumes a company name. Since I do not have the input text, I cannot verify correctness but the format for listing the company names is correct as it is comma-separated (even though there is only one entry).\n\n2. **People names:** The section for People names is empty, which is permissible by the description since not every input text will necessarily mention people names.\n\n3. **Specific topics:** The output lists \"data storage advances\" and \"conference\" as specific topics, which appears to follow the expected format by separating entries with commas.\n\n4. **General themes:** The output lists \"technology innovation,\" \"future trends,\" and \"data management\" under General themes, which are also comma-separated, adhering to the format guidelines provided.\n\nSince the output follows the exact format as specified in the description and there are no deviations regarding the positioning and structuring of each section, the output complies with the description provided for evaluation purposes.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
