  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description provided for the following reasons:\n\n1. The format requires that after \"Company names:\" there should be a comma-separated list, even if it is empty, there should be a placeholder to indicate that no company names are extracted. The same applies to \"People names:\", but in the output, there is no such indication of an empty or non-existent list, making it unclear.\n\n2. In order to comply, the output needs to have placeholders for empty lists as per the desired format, and alternative indicators like an empty list such as a dash or some text indicating no entities were found should be used.\n\nThese reasons led to the conclusion that the output does not adhere to the specified format in the description.\n\nERR",
