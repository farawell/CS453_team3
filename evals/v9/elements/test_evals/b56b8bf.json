It lists \"Company names\" first, followed by \"People names,\" \"Specific topics,\" and \"General themes,\" each in a separate line, which is in line with the required format. Although the \"People names\" section is left empty, without input text, it is assumed there might not have been any people names to extract, hence this doesn't violate the format rules. Additionally, each section is separated by commas as requested, maintaining the format requirements. Therefore, no rule or guideline in the description provided to me has been violated.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
