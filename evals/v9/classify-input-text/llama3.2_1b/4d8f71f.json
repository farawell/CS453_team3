However, according to the chatbot's description, each article should be classified into one of the four specified categories: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech. The output does not directly use one of these specified categories, suggesting a non-compliance with the given guidelines. Additionally, it mentions \"space mission\" and \"was successful\" as categories, which do not align with the provided categories.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
