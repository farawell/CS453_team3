  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides a classification of \"Government, announcements,\" which does not align with any of the specified categories in the description: World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech. The description explicitly states the predefined categories into which a news article should be classified, none of which include \"Government, announcements.\" This output therefore violates the chatbot's description, as it introduces a category not listed in the provided options. The evaluation must focus solely on compliance with the description and not assume any additional context or input, leading to the conclusion that this is a non-compliance issue.\n\nERR"
