  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description provided. The violation is that the output goes beyond simply classifying the article into one of the stated categories (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech) by including an unnecessary inference about the content of the article. The description does not require or mention providing any inferences about the content, but rather, it should strictly classify the article into one of the four categories. Therefore, the presence of inferred content (e.g., about innovative technology or app using AI for medical diagnosis) constitutes a non-compliance with the simple classification task as per the description.\n\nERR"
