O S T I from the first point that I move off the farm?\nIt's actually a relatively high rate if you...\nThat is really high.\nAnd that could be a dumb phone to a smartphone, just not a smartphone in general.\nWell, this study, there must have been a gap in data collection of this study\nbecause they finished up by comparing, I think it's 12 counties on one side,\n12 countries' regulations just in terms of the recommendations for 5G.\nAnd every country was recommending 5G except Switzerland, it said,\nthat had put an emergency brake on the agenda and not implemented it.\nThough I must tell you that I know several people in Switzerland who are saying that 5G is being implemented all over the place in Switzerland.\nSwitzerland and Italy have more stringent limits than are in the U.S.\nThe U.S. FCC standards, I think, are probably the most permissive of any country.\nMost countries do use the international guidelines of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection,\nwhich allows an exposure limit averaged over 30 minutes, almost 50 times higher than the current Austrian standard.\nThe Austrian Health Agency has recommended that the government significantly lower the exposure limit,\nbut the government there has not done so yet.\nBut Switzerland does use this lower limit, and there are a few other countries actually have even lower limits.\nThe Swiss limit is 10% of what ICNRP recommends.\nPoland has the lowest.\nIt's 1% of what ICNRP represents.\nYeah, the Swiss agency had, I guess, increased it from 4 volts a meter to 61 at one point during the testing.\nBut back to the Children and Wireless.org site.\nI highlight something from that study that discusses non-ionizing and NTP studies, National Toxicology Programme.\nAnd actually on non-ionizing radiation, the study reports that, quote,\nin recent years, more and more studies have shown evidence of effects, including increase in cancer states below the limits.\nThere are more studies showing effects than no effects.\nThere are currently substantiated expectations that long-term exposure of human tissues,\neven below the limits, can increase the risk of cancer.\nThat seems pretty direct.\nWould you like to add any observations about these findings?\nYes.\nThat's the peer-reviewed science that shows that long-term exposure, even to low level of radio frequency radiation,\ncan increase the risk of cancer,\nas well as other types of exposures,\nbecause there's evidence that these exposures increase oxidative stress,\nand it alters free radical levels in cells.\nAnd so that would explain why there are, besides cancer, increased risk of cancer,\nthere may be evidence of increased risk of neurological and reproductive effects,\nas well as possibly increased risk of cardiovascular effects.\nThere was a study that came out about a year ago that showed that RNA, non-coding RNA,\nthere was plenty of evidence that these radio frequency energies altered those genomic, functional RNA,\nand may affect differentiation and organogenesis, tissue, and organ differentiation,\nand consequently should not be used by pregnant women.\nIn fact, there are thousands of physicians who have signed a petition saying we need a moratorium\non any further rollout of cell towers, including 5G,\nuntil we can get more information on the potential safety of this technology.\nAnd certainly we should control or curtail use by children and pregnant women.\nYeah, I agree with you there.\nWe're already seeing it.\nI mean, children rounding the age of just texting with cell phones,\nthey don't even use them that much.\nBut even at those low-level frequencies, we're seeing increases in, you know,\npossibly behavioral issues, ADHD, etc.\nBut we want to move on to the emissions lower than the current authorizations.\nAnd the Swiss 5G Laser Study had some interesting things to report, too.\nWhat would you like to say about that?\nWell, I think people believe erroneously that costs should dictate what we do in terms of regulations,\nand that is it gets very costly to raise standards at an industrial level.\nBut the question is, what's the life worth?\nAnd when we don't know how much damage is going to occur, we suspect that there will be enough,\nand we have evidence already, certainly from these animal studies,\nin addition to the studies of human exposure to phones,\nthat levels of exposure that will be well within this limit of 10 million microwatts per meter square\nwill cause cancer over time.\nIn fact, if you look at the animal exposure studies on which the current standards are based,\nthere is, of course, is the National Toxicology Program of the United States\nand the Italian National Toxicology Studies have come out with findings of DNA damage in animals after two years.\nNow, what people don't realize is that those exposures are thousands of times more intense, of course,\nthan exposures to cell towers that we are going to be getting in 5G.\nBut 5G also involves extraordinarily complex technology,\nwhere you have multiple antenna, multiple waveform, 3D beams.\nThese are all being modulated, different bandwidths.\nAnd again, I don't think any study has been published to date on the kind of 5G technology\nthat we're expected to have at these higher frequencies.\nThere are some studies on the use of 30 and 35 gigahertz radiation\nthat show stimulation of the immune system adversely.\nAnd I think that's some of the concerns that have been raised\nbecause of what is known from looking at this Rony study of the impact on immune function\nfrom 30, 35 gigahertz studies.\nAnd we're going to have this type of frequency used for 5G in very high power levels,\non an ongoing basis.\nNow, the standards have been raised at the low frequency of the radio frequencies of microwave,\nsimilar to what we're getting with phones.\nAnd they may vary significantly at these higher frequencies,\nwhich exist and have not yet been placed out there\nbecause the large telecommunications providers are still developing the technology\nto use those particular wavelengths.\nBut again, I think we have to be mindful of the fact\nthat our current federal safety limit is not protective,\njust by itself.\nOn what do I, how do I make that assumption?\nNot just my independent analysis, which I did.\nI wrote the science in the ICNRB RF review\nand have been studying this issue since 1976.\nBut also the Government Accountability Office in 2012 issued a report saying that the current standard is in need of review and assessment.\nNow, what's going to take place, what's a shame actually,\nis that the Federal Communications Commission is about to rubber stamp adoption of the recommendation\nthat it made back in 2012 to basically maintain the 1996 standards.\nThey haven't updated them at all, even though they claim they've been reviewing the literature.\nThe fact is they held a docket open for over five years and never even published over 1,000 comments they received from scientists,\npolicymakers, and the telecommunications industry.\nSo we know that the government is not doing its job.\nThe Food and Drug Administration is supposedly responsible for protecting our health,\nbut they have not bothered to look at the research on genetic damage from exposures to cell phones and other wireless radiation.\nThey only look at whether exposure causes tumors, and that is woefully inadequate.\nI've written a letter to the Inspector General for Health and Human Services about my belief that this is a dereliction of duty and that this needs to be fixed.\nAnd that all of this is occurring in the context of a very powerful and large and well-endowed telecommunications industry.\nSure.\nSo that sounds like some enterprising Japanese entrepreneur would capitalize on this.\nWe've only got five minutes left.\nBob, one of the elements in that Swiss paper was a list of 12 different countries and their regulations.\nI think it was surprisingly self-contradictory in the sense that it was stated that there wasn't any evidence.\nAnd then at the end, just before that 5G comment showed the varying regulations in countries and how some have different assessments of risk than others.\nI mean, this is a common finding, is it not?\nYes.\nBut your concern about cost came up again in reference to the Swiss 5G study.\nWhat did they have to say about that?\nWell, there is concern about the cost to industry to reduce the level of exposure.\nAnd, you know, it is costly with microwave radiation to modify the exposures of a high tower, high power amplitude modulated waves coming out of most directional antennas.\nBut, again, I would quote Theo Coulomb, one of the developers behind basic electronic devices who said,\nif people understood better what this radiation was doing to them, they would spend more money, not less, to make it safer.\nAnd that has certainly been the case, for example, in nuclear power.\nThere were fatal accidents in both military and research reactors in the United States and England in the 50s,\nwhich prompted the development of radiation protection regulations.\nAnd they were strengthened and strengthened and strengthened.\nWhen Russia offered us their radiation limits for microwave radiation exposures in the 1990s,\nI was at a meeting in Copenhagen on the phone with officials at the Environmental Protection Agency saying,\nlisten to what Russia is saying and we should adopt these interim guidelines.\nAt the time, standards in Russia were 1,000 times more stringent than they are in the United States.\nAnd, in fact, the only thing that has happened in terms of public policy in the U.S.\nis that our environmental agencies have been not only defunded with respect to this area,\nthey have been told not to work on this issue.\nAnd this is a huge problem.\nSo, at the federal level.\nNow, we do have some states that are looking at it.\nOregon's passed a law.\nMaryland is considering doing something.\nThey're the first two states in the country to really get involved with concern about this issue.\nBut it is regrettable that the federal agencies have been really completely handicapped\nand aren't able to provide any guidance.\nWell, this has been fascinating today.\nAnd we're coming up on the end of our time.\nThank you so much, Dr. Davis, for being with us.\nSo, quickly, in the last minute, what would you like to leave, Fred, with you?\nAny thoughts?\nWell, I think the FCC has basically acted once again as a cheerleader for an untested technology.\nAnd if people want to learn more, they can go to our website, ehtrust.org,\nand take action so that we can stop the rollout of 5G on a universal basis all at once in 2020,\nwhich is what the companies are proposing to do, until we understand better.\nWhat happened with 3G and 4G was they were rolled out, and only afterwards did we learn\nthat extensive damage was being done, not just to humans, but other animals as well.\nThis time, with the knowledge and the science that we do have, I think a precautionary principle\ndemands that we slow down and require some independent testing and evaluation before we roll this out\nto the entire globe.\nThank you.\nThat makes perfect sense, doesn't it, Doug?\nIt does.\nIf people only understand what it's really doing to them.\nAnd we're going to have to monitor and fight the implementation of this so that safety becomes\nas important as costs.\nAnd that's the bottom line.\nThank you so much for being with us today, Dr. Davies.\nWe'd like to have you come back at some point.\nYou've got so much wealth of information to share with us, and this has just been an amazing interview.\nThank you very much, and good luck in your work.\nThank you.\nI must say, when we've been chatting with a number of the doctors in the union,\nI think you are by far the most understanding.\nI hope people appreciate that.\nWe agree.\nBless you for that.\nThank you.\nSure.\nTake care.\nThis is the Community Correction on WMPG.\nOur thanks to Dr. Davies for joining your host here, Doug McLean, in pursuing safer technology\non November 16th.\nFor our listeners, if you missed our conversation, a recording will be available to stream on the\nWMPG podcast site quite soon.\nI'll be back in a couple of weeks with another special program.\nin, Maine on Sunday next.\nThis has been the Community Connection on WMPG.\nKeep listening as I continue my conversation with Dr. Davies on what people can do to lessen\ntheir exposure to wireless radio frequency radiations and why that is important to be\naware of.",

However, the task is to classify the news article into only one of the specified categories.\n\n2. **Unclear Final Classification**: The chatbot output is muddled, as it mentions both Business and Sports categories, but it is not clear if \"Category: Sports\" is the final decision. The reference to \"Category: Business - Yes, same as above\" implies potential indecision.\n\n3. **Extraneous Output Information**: It includes unnecessary lines about checking options and texting specifics (\"I'll check the other options as well\", \"Eco-friendly policies could apply...\"). The description only requires classification, not a detailed explanation or mention of content considerations outside the given categories.\n\nThus, given these factors, the chatbot's output does not comply with the requirement to classify the article into one single category clearly and directly.\n\nERR",
