B O O S T I from the first point that I move off the farm?
It's actually a relatively high rate if you...
That is really high.
And that could be a dumb phone to a smartphone, just not a smartphone in general.
Well, this study, there must have been a gap in data collection of this study
because they finished up by comparing, I think it's 12 counties on one side,
12 countries' regulations just in terms of the recommendations for 5G.
And every country was recommending 5G except Switzerland, it said,
that had put an emergency brake on the agenda and not implemented it.
Though I must tell you that I know several people in Switzerland who are saying that 5G is being implemented all over the place in Switzerland.
Switzerland and Italy have more stringent limits than are in the U.S.
The U.S. FCC standards, I think, are probably the most permissive of any country.
Most countries do use the international guidelines of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection,
which allows an exposure limit averaged over 30 minutes, almost 50 times higher than the current Austrian standard.
The Austrian Health Agency has recommended that the government significantly lower the exposure limit,
but the government there has not done so yet.
But Switzerland does use this lower limit, and there are a few other countries actually have even lower limits.
The Swiss limit is 10% of what ICNRP recommends.
Poland has the lowest.
It's 1% of what ICNRP represents.
Yeah, the Swiss agency had, I guess, increased it from 4 volts a meter to 61 at one point during the testing.
But back to the Children and Wireless.org site.
I highlight something from that study that discusses non-ionizing and NTP studies, National Toxicology Programme.
And actually on non-ionizing radiation, the study reports that, quote,
in recent years, more and more studies have shown evidence of effects, including increase in cancer states below the limits.
There are more studies showing effects than no effects.
There are currently substantiated expectations that long-term exposure of human tissues,
even below the limits, can increase the risk of cancer.
That seems pretty direct.
Would you like to add any observations about these findings?
Yes.
That's the peer-reviewed science that shows that long-term exposure, even to low level of radio frequency radiation,
can increase the risk of cancer,
as well as other types of exposures,
because there's evidence that these exposures increase oxidative stress,
and it alters free radical levels in cells.
And so that would explain why there are, besides cancer, increased risk of cancer,
there may be evidence of increased risk of neurological and reproductive effects,
as well as possibly increased risk of cardiovascular effects.
There was a study that came out about a year ago that showed that RNA, non-coding RNA,
there was plenty of evidence that these radio frequency energies altered those genomic, functional RNA,
and may affect differentiation and organogenesis, tissue, and organ differentiation,
and consequently should not be used by pregnant women.
In fact, there are thousands of physicians who have signed a petition saying we need a moratorium
on any further rollout of cell towers, including 5G,
until we can get more information on the potential safety of this technology.
And certainly we should control or curtail use by children and pregnant women.
Yeah, I agree with you there.
We're already seeing it.
I mean, children rounding the age of just texting with cell phones,
they don't even use them that much.
But even at those low-level frequencies, we're seeing increases in, you know,
possibly behavioral issues, ADHD, etc.
But we want to move on to the emissions lower than the current authorizations.
And the Swiss 5G Laser Study had some interesting things to report, too.
What would you like to say about that?
Well, I think people believe erroneously that costs should dictate what we do in terms of regulations,
and that is it gets very costly to raise standards at an industrial level.
But the question is, what's the life worth?
And when we don't know how much damage is going to occur, we suspect that there will be enough,
and we have evidence already, certainly from these animal studies,
in addition to the studies of human exposure to phones,
that levels of exposure that will be well within this limit of 10 million microwatts per meter square
will cause cancer over time.
In fact, if you look at the animal exposure studies on which the current standards are based,
there is, of course, is the National Toxicology Program of the United States
and the Italian National Toxicology Studies have come out with findings of DNA damage in animals after two years.
Now, what people don't realize is that those exposures are thousands of times more intense, of course,
than exposures to cell towers that we are going to be getting in 5G.
But 5G also involves extraordinarily complex technology,
where you have multiple antenna, multiple waveform, 3D beams.
These are all being modulated, different bandwidths.
And again, I don't think any study has been published to date on the kind of 5G technology
that we're expected to have at these higher frequencies.
There are some studies on the use of 30 and 35 gigahertz radiation
that show stimulation of the immune system adversely.
And I think that's some of the concerns that have been raised
because of what is known from looking at this Rony study of the impact on immune function
from 30, 35 gigahertz studies.
And we're going to have this type of frequency used for 5G in very high power levels,
on an ongoing basis.
Now, the standards have been raised at the low frequency of the radio frequencies of microwave,
similar to what we're getting with phones.
And they may vary significantly at these higher frequencies,
which exist and have not yet been placed out there
because the large telecommunications providers are still developing the technology
to use those particular wavelengths.
But again, I think we have to be mindful of the fact
that our current federal safety limit is not protective,
just by itself.
On what do I, how do I make that assumption?
Not just my independent analysis, which I did.
I wrote the science in the ICNRB RF review
and have been studying this issue since 1976.
But also the Government Accountability Office in 2012 issued a report saying that the current standard is in need of review and assessment.
Now, what's going to take place, what's a shame actually,
is that the Federal Communications Commission is about to rubber stamp adoption of the recommendation
that it made back in 2012 to basically maintain the 1996 standards.
They haven't updated them at all, even though they claim they've been reviewing the literature.
The fact is they held a docket open for over five years and never even published over 1,000 comments they received from scientists,
policymakers, and the telecommunications industry.
So we know that the government is not doing its job.
The Food and Drug Administration is supposedly responsible for protecting our health,
but they have not bothered to look at the research on genetic damage from exposures to cell phones and other wireless radiation.
They only look at whether exposure causes tumors, and that is woefully inadequate.
I've written a letter to the Inspector General for Health and Human Services about my belief that this is a dereliction of duty and that this needs to be fixed.
And that all of this is occurring in the context of a very powerful and large and well-endowed telecommunications industry.
Sure.
So that sounds like some enterprising Japanese entrepreneur would capitalize on this.
We've only got five minutes left.
Bob, one of the elements in that Swiss paper was a list of 12 different countries and their regulations.
I think it was surprisingly self-contradictory in the sense that it was stated that there wasn't any evidence.
And then at the end, just before that 5G comment showed the varying regulations in countries and how some have different assessments of risk than others.
I mean, this is a common finding, is it not?
Yes.
But your concern about cost came up again in reference to the Swiss 5G study.
What did they have to say about that?
Well, there is concern about the cost to industry to reduce the level of exposure.
And, you know, it is costly with microwave radiation to modify the exposures of a high tower, high power amplitude modulated waves coming out of most directional antennas.
But, again, I would quote Theo Coulomb, one of the developers behind basic electronic devices who said,
if people understood better what this radiation was doing to them, they would spend more money, not less, to make it safer.
And that has certainly been the case, for example, in nuclear power.
There were fatal accidents in both military and research reactors in the United States and England in the 50s,
which prompted the development of radiation protection regulations.
And they were strengthened and strengthened and strengthened.
When Russia offered us their radiation limits for microwave radiation exposures in the 1990s,
I was at a meeting in Copenhagen on the phone with officials at the Environmental Protection Agency saying,
listen to what Russia is saying and we should adopt these interim guidelines.
At the time, standards in Russia were 1,000 times more stringent than they are in the United States.
And, in fact, the only thing that has happened in terms of public policy in the U.S.
is that our environmental agencies have been not only defunded with respect to this area,
they have been told not to work on this issue.
And this is a huge problem.
So, at the federal level.
Now, we do have some states that are looking at it.
Oregon's passed a law.
Maryland is considering doing something.
They're the first two states in the country to really get involved with concern about this issue.
But it is regrettable that the federal agencies have been really completely handicapped

Well, this has been fascinating today.
And we're coming up on the end of our time.
Thank you so much, Dr. Davis, for being with us.
So, quickly, in the last minute, what would you like to leave, Fred, with you?
Any thoughts?
Well, I think the FCC has basically acted once again as a cheerleader for an untested technology.
And if people want to learn more, they can go to our website, ehtrust.org,
and take action so that we can stop the rollout of 5G on a universal basis all at once in 2020,
which is what the companies are proposing to do, until we understand better.
What happened with 3G and 4G was they were rolled out, and only afterwards did we learn
that extensive damage was being done, not just to humans, but other animals as well.
This time, with the knowledge and the science that we do have, I think a precautionary principle
demands that we slow down and require some independent testing and evaluation before we roll this out
to the entire globe.
Thank you.
That makes perfect sense, doesn't it, Doug?
It does.
If people only understand what it's really doing to them.
And we're going to have to monitor and fight the implementation of this so that safety becomes
as important as costs.
And that's the bottom line.
Thank you so much for being with us today, Dr. Davies.
We'd like to have you come back at some point.
You've got so much wealth of information to share with us, and this has just been an amazing interview.
Thank you very much, and good luck in your work.
Thank you.
I must say, when we've been chatting with a number of the doctors in the union,
I think you are by far the most understanding.
I hope people appreciate that.
We agree.
Bless you for that.
Thank you.
Sure.
Take care.
This is the Community Correction on WMPG.
Our thanks to Dr. Davies for joining your host here, Doug McLean, in pursuing safer technology
on November 16th.
For our listeners, if you missed our conversation, a recording will be available to stream on the
WMPG podcast site quite soon.
I'll be back in a couple of weeks with another special program.
in, Maine on Sunday next.
This has been the Community Connection on WMPG.
Keep listening as I continue my conversation with Dr. Davies on what people can do to lessen
their exposure to wireless radio frequency radiations and why that is important to be

While this title primarily refers to a technological advancement, it's more accurately classified within the business sector due to its corporate nature and product launch. The novelty revolves around product innovation by a tech company rather than any broader business or industry-wide issue. Thus, the most fitting category for this article would be "Business." & err & The chatbot's output provides a classification of "Business" for a news article titled "Tech company unveils groundbreaking new smartphone design". The description specifies that news articles should be classified under one of the categories: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech. The title suggests a technological advancement, but the chatbot has explained its classification with reasoning that highlights the corporate aspect and product launch, categorizing it under Business. While this reasoning is clear, it is expected that the category for tech-related innovations is Sci/Tech unless detailed context changes the classification into Business due to product launch or corporate focus prominently.

The description does not specify that business classification requires information on product launches or corporate nature, it directly associates Sci/Tech with technological content. Without the input, exact correctness cannot be ascertained, yet the focus on technology is apparent and matches more closely to Sci/Tech unless the article deeply focuses on business aspects which cannot be inferred without the input.

Category: Business & err & The chatbot output does not comply with the description as it incorrectly associates "dramatic last-minute victory" with the Business category. Based on the categories provided (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech), "victory" is typically associated with sports-related events, not business or finance, as suggested by the example "Ronaldo scores twice in Manchester United return". The chatbot's reasoning for classifying the article under Business appears flawed, as it equates a term generally related to sports with business. Therefore, there is a violation in the classification logic.

text: "Merger creates the world's largest telecommunications company" & The same text applies to both classifications. It does not specifically convey a message about World, Sports, or Sci/Tech topics. Therefore, I would classify this news article under Business. & err & The provided chatbot output attempts to classify a news article. However, it contains an ambiguous statement: "The same text applies to both classifications," which implies a contradictory or unclear classification. Moreover, it states, "It does not specifically convey a message about World, Sports, or Sci/Tech topics," yet concludes with "classify this news article under Business" without providing a clear rationale. This creates a lack of direct and explicit compliance with the description, as the classification should be directly one of the given categories without referencing dual applicability or providing unclear reasoning.

text: "Breakthrough in solar panel technology promises affordable clean energy" & The classification for both texts is the same:

Category: Sci/Tech & err & The chatbot output mentions "both texts," implying there are two news articles. However, the description specifies that a single news article should be classified into one of four categories: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech. The mention of two texts and classifying them as the same category does not explicitly adhere to the guideline of classifying one article. This indicates an issue in the output related to multiplicity. The output should have included classification for only one article, as prescribed by the description.

Based on the explicit elements specified in the description and the deviation in the output, the evaluation suggests a violation.

This classification directly aligns with one of the stated categories in the provided description, which includes World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech. Since the output does contain a direct, explicit classification into one of these categories, it complies with the description's requirement to classify a news article into one of the specified categories.

- Sports & ok & The chatbot output states that it can only classify the news article into one category, which it has mentioned as "Sports." According to the description, the chatbot is supposed to classify an article explicitly into one of the predefined categories (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech). The output does provide a category ("Sports"), which aligns with one of the predefined categories. There is no explicit non-compliance with the description given for classification, as it lists a specific category. Therefore, despite the unresolved ambiguity in the initial phrase, it completes the required task by identifying a single category explicitly.

In that case, I would classify the news article as:

Sci/Tech & err & The chatbot output provides a classification of "Sci/Tech," which is one of the four specified categories. However, it includes an additional sentence "The classification should be the same since it's the same article." This statement is irrelevant to the task description which only requires the classification of the news article into one of the categories.

A corrected classification might be:
 Category: World
text: "International assistance reaches areas devastated by hurricane"
category: Business & err & The chatbot's output does not comply with the description. The description requires that the chatbot classify a news article as one of the specified categories: World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech. However, the output here makes overlapping claims by categorizing the text as both World and Business in different instances, which is not allowed according to the description that states a news article can be classified as one of the categories. Also, the text appears to be classified twice with different categories, once under World and once under Business, without a final consolidated classification, which implies a lack of decisiveness in categorization. Therefore, the output contains a violation because the classification approach does not conform to the requirement for singular category assignment.

The chatbot is expected to classify a news article into one of the categories: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech. The output given is "category: Sports," which represents a valid category from the list provided in the description. There is no requirement in the description to justify or provide additional information along with the classification, so providing only the category aligns with the description.

 Text: "Cryptocurrency reaches all-time high market value"

Categories: 
* Category 1: Business (already mentioned)
* Category 2: Business & err & The chatbot output states that it categorizes the article under two categories, which is not in line with the description that allows for classification into only one category. The example given lists a news topic under a single category as per the guidelines. The output also duplicates the category "Business" under both 'Category 1' and 'Category 2', which is redundant and does not follow the structure suggested in the description. The instruction was to classify the article into a single category among the given options.

The text itself is not present, but I can infer that this article will be about an innovative technology or app that utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) in order to help diagnose medical conditions remotely. & err & The chatbot output does not comply with the description provided. The violation is that the output goes beyond simply classifying the article into one of the stated categories (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech) by including an unnecessary inference about the content of the article. The description does not require or mention providing any inferences about the content, but rather, it should strictly classify the article into one of the four categories. Therefore, the presence of inferred content (e.g., about innovative technology or app using AI for medical diagnosis) constitutes a non-compliance with the simple classification task as per the description.

text: "Peace talks between nations show promising progress" & I'll correct the classification to "World" because both sentences are identical.

So, the corrected answer is: Category: World & ok & The chatbot's output discusses correcting the classification to "World" based on the fact that "both sentences are identical." The guidelines require that the output classifies a news article into one of the four categories: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech. The output does conclude with a determination: "Category: World."

However, there is a point in the output that is unclear without knowing additional context: the mention of "both sentences are identical" does not clearly connect to the task of categorizing a news article into a defined category. As per the description, the task is to classify the given text, and the reasoning behind the classification should align with the categories. Additionally, the need to mention any sentence similarity pertains to the process rather than the classification itself, leading to a non-explicit output.

Despite the correct identification of a category, the process-related commentary implies the output may include processing steps rather than solely focusing on the requested classification. Considering these aspects, without knowing the input or why sentences comparability is mentioned, I will judge the compliance solely based on the conclusive statement provided.

No explicit rule violation is clear strictly from the given output in terms of classification result.

However, since the text only appears once, I would classify it as a Sports category, as it is exclusively about a sport (marathon running). & err & The chatbot output suggests that the news article is classified initially as both a World category and a Sports category, but ultimately chooses to classify it as a Sports category. This violates the guideline as each article should be classified as belonging to only one category. Mentioning more than one category initially and then choosing one is non-compliant with the explicit instruction which does not support multiple classifications before deciding on the final one.

Category: Sci/Tech & err & The chatbot output mentions that the text appears to be a duplicate or advertisement, which is not a category listed in the description. However, it ultimately provides a classification of "Sci/Tech," which is a valid category according to the description. The mention of the text being a duplicate or advertisement does not conform with any of the specified categories nor does it comply with directly classifying the article under one of those categories, leading to a determination that there is a non-compliance with the expected output structure since no additional commentary outside of the categorization prompt is suggested.

The output does present the correct format with the ultimate category provided. However, it includes unnecessary information prior to the classification, which is not compliant with the description that solely focuses on categorizing the news article into the specified categories without any added commentary or analysis.

The reason is that both sentences start with the same phrase, which indicates that the article is about a global or international issue, specifically the refugee crisis. There's no indication of a sports, business, science, or tech-related topic in this sentence. & ok & Based on the given output, the chatbot has classified the news article as "World." The output includes an explanation stating that the article is about a "global or international issue." This explanation does not violate any rules specified in the chatbot description. Specifically, the chatbot has chosen one of the given categories ("World"), which aligns with the task of classifying the article into one of the specified categories. The explanation provided, relating to a "global or international issue," aligns with what would typically qualify under a "World" classification, which involves topics of global concern.

However, given the guidelines, I should focus only on whether the output follows the description, and the only requirement here is that it should classify the news article into one of the four predefined categories: World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech.

The presence of Ronaldo's name combined with his history playing for Manchester United makes this article likely to be from the Sports category.

Category: Business - Yes, same as above.
Since both options read the same, I'll provide the answer:

 Category: Sports & err & The chatbot output contains several parts which are problematic in the context of the given description:

1. **Multiple Categories and Decisions**: The output includes multiple category considerations, stating "Category: World" and "Category: Business - Yes, same as above". However, the task is to classify the news article into only one of the specified categories.

2. **Unclear Final Classification**: The chatbot output is muddled, as it mentions both Business and Sports categories, but it is not clear if "Category: Sports" is the final decision. The reference to "Category: Business - Yes, same as above" implies potential indecision.

3. **Extraneous Output Information**: It includes unnecessary lines about checking options and texting specifics ("I'll check the other options as well", "Eco-friendly policies could apply..."). The description only requires classification, not a detailed explanation or mention of content considerations outside the given categories.

Thus, given these factors, the chatbot's output does not comply with the requirement to classify the article into one single category clearly and directly.
