Based on the description, the task of the chatbot is to classify a news article into one of four categories: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech. The output \"World\" is one of those specified categories. Since we are only checking for compliance and not correctness, I can't check if the classification is correct because the input article is not provided. Therefore, the output is compliant with the given description as it matches one of the valid categories.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
