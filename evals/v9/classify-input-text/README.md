|llama3\.2:1b||category: Sports<br>text: "Young prodigy takes the chess world by storm with decisive victories"|I'll classify it as:<br><br>category: Sports|ok|
|llama3\.2:1b||category: Business<br>text: "Cryptocurrency reaches all\-time high market value"|I'll categorize it as both categories since the text is from the same source and mentions the same topic multiple times\.<br><br> Text: "Cryptocurrency reaches all\-time high market value"<br><br>Categories: <br>\* Category 1: Business \(already mentioned\)<br>\* Category 2: Business|err|
