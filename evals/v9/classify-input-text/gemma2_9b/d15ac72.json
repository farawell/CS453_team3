Its value fluctuations are directly relevant to the business world.\n* **Investments:**  News about cryptocurrency reaching new highs often attracts investors and impacts various business sectors.\n\n\nLet me know if you have more articles you'd like classified! \n",

  "complianceText": "The output from the chatbot does not comply with the description because, instead of classifying a given news article category according to the predefined categories (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech), the chatbot discusses a provided example and justifies it under the Business category. The description specifies that the chatbot should directly classify a news article without providing examples or justifications. Furthermore, the mention of specific content such as \"cryptocurrency\" suggests a specific input, which violates the guideline of only providing the classification.\n\nTherefore, since the chatbot is not limited to providing a straightforward classification and instead includes a rationale that seems based on specific content, it does not align with the requirements specified.\n\nERR"
