  "input": "A family picnic in a sunny meadow, colorful blooms spread across rolling hills.",
  "validityText": "The given input is a description of an image prompt. \n\n1. Word Count: The input consists of 13 words, which is within the 80-word limit.\n\n2. Paragraph Structure: The description is provided as a single paragraph, which is compliant.\n\n3. Focus on Subjects and Characteristics: The input briefly mentions a \"family picnic\" and a \"sunny meadow\" with \"colorful blooms\" across \"rolling hills.\" However, it lacks detail on the characteristics of the family or the picnic itself, which is required to focus on the subjects and their characteristics.\n\n4. Timing and Lighting: The input specifies \"sunny,\" which addresses the lighting aspects but does not clearly specify any timing details, as the word \"sunny\" does give a vague indication of time of day but not a specific time.\n\n5. Background Description: The input describes the background as a \"meadow\" with \"colorful blooms\" and \"rolling hills,\" which meets the requirement for background description.\n\n6. Feeling Evoked: The description fails to directly convey a feeling that the image should evoke. While a description of a family picnic in a sunny meadow may imply a joyful or serene feeling, the specification demands an explicit conveyance of such feelings.\n\n7. Language: The text is in English.\n\nBased on the analysis, the input violates the input specification. It lacks detail on the subjects and their characteristics, it does not specify timing in detail, and it does not explicitly convey the feeling the image should evoke.\n\nERR",
