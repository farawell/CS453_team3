However, the output contains non-English text at the end. This violates the requirement that the output be generated entirely in English. Additionally, the output must be a single paragraph not exceeding 80 words, focused on subjects, their characteristics, timing, lighting, background, and the feeling to be evoked. Although the rest of the output seems to follow this guideline, the presence of non-English characters results in non-compliance.\n\nDue to the presence of the non-English text, I conclude that there is a violation of the guideline concerning the language of the output.\n\nERR"
