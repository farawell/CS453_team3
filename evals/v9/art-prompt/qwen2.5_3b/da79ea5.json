The timing is indicated by \"golden hour\" and \"as the sun sets,\" and the lighting seems to be implied with \"casting brilliant arcs.\" The background—the beach—is described. The output also conveys a feeling: \"a sense of calm and warm melancholy.\" The description seems to fit within the word limit, although it's not counted explicitly here. Based on the output's compliance with the description rules that can be checked without the input, it complies with the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
