Their faces are set towards the morning, eyes slightly closed or downcast as if lost in thought. The woman's hair is tied back, while he wears a hat to shield his face from the sun, his hand resting on his hip as he scans their surroundings. In the background, the mountain crest stretches upwards, its rugged peaks still capped with mist; valleys undulate gently below, reflecting like calm water in distant rivers.",
