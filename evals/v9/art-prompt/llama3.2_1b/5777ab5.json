  "output": "\"Transform this vibrant beach scene into a captivating AI-generated image. Capture the warmth of 4-5 family members playing in the shallow turquoise waters, surrounded by towering palm trees, their trunks adorned with seashells and delicate green fronds that sway gracefully to an imaginary breeze, evoking a sense of carefree joy.\"",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output passes several of the criteria set forth in the description: it is crafted in a single paragraph and is in English. However, upon examining the details, there are some areas where it does not fully comply with the description. Firstly, the word count appears to slightly exceed the 80-word limit specified for the description. This is primarily due to the use of elaborate descriptions, such as \"their trunks adorned with seashells and delicate green fronds that sway gracefully to an imaginary breeze,\" which makes the prompt quite rich but lengthy. The output describes subjects (family members), details the background (palm trees), and evokes a feeling (carefree joy). However, it lacks explicit mention of timing and lighting details, which are requested in the guidelines. There should also be a specific focus on detailing \"timing\" and \"lighting\", which is not explicitly seen in the text.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
