  "output": "To generate this AI photo prompt:\n\nStart by painting a serene atmosphere - morning light gradually creeping over the cityscape (5 words). Use gentle, feathery strokes to convey soft clouds across the sky, with subtle gradations of blue and grey hues, hinting at advanced weather technologies. \n\nShow majestic skyscrapers gleaming in the dawn light, their glass fa√ßades rippling like liquid as they reflect the emerging sun's rays, exuding a sense of sophistication and technological prowess. Drones can be subtly sketched hovering just behind or above these towering structures, with gentle trails of glittering silver dust emanating from their rooftops (8 words). The drones' movements convey movement without turbulence, emphasizing agility and precision. \n\nAdd quiet streets to the outskirts of this futuristic cityscape, punctuated by advanced infrastructure such as glowing neon signs, holographic advertisements, or LED-lit pedestrian paths that subtly glow underfoot in soothing tones of blue and green (10 words), creating a calming atmosphere where technology seamlessly integrates with nature (11 words).\n\nTo evoke an image of serenity:\n\nEnd the scene with a tranquil reflection pool (2 words) surrounded by lush, futuristic trees (5 words). Greenery can sprout from concrete cracks or windowsills to create an organic feel, suggesting humanity connects and adapts while preserving harmony within this technological world. The pool's calm reflections will symbolize introspection, growth, or balance amidst rapid advancements.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output violates the description in several ways. Firstly, the output is not crafted in a single paragraph but rather broken into several sections with different focuses, which goes against the instruction of generating a detailed prompt in one paragraph. Secondly, parts of the output contain instructions or suggestions on how to \"generate\" or \"paint\" an image, which implies using an imperative tone, instead of focusing on describing the subject, timing, lighting, background, and evoking a feeling in a single narrative flow. This instructional style is inconsistent with the expectation to create impactful AI-generated photo prompts with artistic insight and precise imagery. Lastly, the description's requirement that every description should not exceed 80 words is not adhered to because each section includes extra information like word counts in parentheses which do not contribute to the imagery but inflate the word count.\n\nERR"
