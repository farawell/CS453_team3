- Prompt Under Test (PUT) - like Program Under Test; the prompt
- Model Under Test (MUT) - Model which we are testing against with specific temperature, etc example: gpt-4o-mini
- Model Used by PromptPex (MPP) - gpt-4o

- Input Specification (IS) - Extracting input constraints of PUT using MPP
- Output Rules (OR) - Extracting output constraints of PUT using MPP
- Output Rules Groundedness (ORG) - Checks if OR is grounded in PUT using MPP

- Prompt Under Test Intent (PUTI) - Extracting the exact task from PUT using MMP

- PromptPex Tests (PPT) - Test cases generated for PUT with MPP using IS and OR
- Baseline Tests (BT) - Zero shot test cases generated for PUT with MPP

- Test Input Compliance (TIC) - Checking if PPT and BT meets the constraints in IS using MPP
- Test Coverage (TC) - Result generated for PPT and BT on PUTI + OR with MPP

- Test Output (TO) - Result generated for PPT and BT on PUT with each MUT
- Test Output ComplianceÂ (TOC) - Checking if TO meets the constraints in PUT using MPP

Word: "Upon"|To determine the part of speech \(POS\) tag for the word "Upon" in the given sentence, let's analyze it closely\.<br><br>\#\#\# Context:<br>The full sentence is "Upon their arrival, the team began the presentation efficiently\."<br><br>In this context:<br>\- "Upon" is a preposition and serves as an adverbial phrase to indicate time\.<br>  <br>"Upon" introduces an ablative noun structure indicating the reason for something that has happened or will happen\.<br><br>\#\#\# POS Tag Analysis:<br>1\. \*\*Coordinating conjunction \(CC\)\*\*: This would typically be used with other words like 'and' or 'but', which is not the case here\.<br>2\. \*\*Cardinal number \(CD\)\*\*: Not applicable since it's a preposition/adverb, not a number\.<br>3\. \*\*Determiner \(DT\)\*\*: No determiners are present in this sentence that would modify a noun directly before "Upon"\.<br>4\. \*\*Existential there \(EX\)\*\*: It doesn't fit with the context of usage given\.<br>5\. \*\*Foreign word \(FW\)\*\*: Not used as a standalone preposition\.<br>6\. \*\*Preposition or subordinating conjunction \(IN\)\*\*: Given the role "upon" plays, it is better categorized here versus joining other words directly like subordinating conjunction typically does\.<br>7\. \*\*Adjective \(JJ\), \(JJR\), and \(JJS\)\*\*: While adjectives can be prepositions in certain contexts, this doesn't seem to be a typical adverb/adjective function of "Upon" here\.<br>8\. \*\*List Item Marker \(LS\)\*\*: Itâs not used as such; it serves more as an introductory phrase here\.<br>9\. \*\*Modal \(MD\)\*\*: Not fitting the usage seen in this context\.<br>10\. \*\*Noun \(NN\), \(NNS\), etc\*\*: While prepositions can refer to certain nouns, "upon" here functions as an adverb with the time indicator role\.<br>11\. \*\*Personal pronoun \(PRP\)\*\*: Not applicable; follows a different pattern or structure\.<br>12\. \*\*Posessive ending \(POS\)\*\*: Doesn't apply in this sentence;<br>13\. \*\*Particle \(RP\)\*\*: Incongruous given its syntactical use of "Upon"\.<br>14\. \*\*Symbol \(SYM\)\*\*: Not used typically as a preposition, rather more symbolic within the context\.<br>15\. \*\*To \(TO\)\*\*: Itâs not joined with another word here, nor does it show up directly in this role\.<br>16\. \*\*Interjection \(UH\)\*\*: Doesnât fit the structure of "Upon" seen\. <br>17\. \*\*Verb \(VB\), \(VBD\), \(VBG\), \(VBN\), \(VBZ\) etc\*\*: This doesnât apply as a direct verb but rather setting up another verb phrase\.<br>18\. \*\*Wh\-determiner \(WDT\)\*\*: It doesn't fit into this category; âUponâ is not asking for quantity or any specific noun\.<br>19\. \*\*Wh\-pronoun \(WP\), \(WP$\):\*\* Again, usage here doesnât require a question, it leads to explanation/identification like "wh"\-adverb function with "upon"\.<br>20\. \*\*Symbol \(WRB\)\*\*: Not typical usage of this particular phrase; generally used for clarification or emphasis\.<br><br>\#\#\# Conclusion:<br>The best fit in the provided list would be under \*\*Preposition \(IN\) if any options are expanded, but it's more commonly grouped under Verb\-based context due to prepositional syntax and contextual usage here\.<br><br>So, "Upon" isnât exactly fitting into a discrete category of all listed specifically as nouns or adjectives\. Since itâs fundamentally structured in this given sentence with a temporal reference function without additional specific role like WP/PRP:<br><br>\#\#\# Final Decision Based Listed Tags:<br>\- \*\*CantAnswer\*\* if not fitting directly under the listed roles\.<br><br>Final Answer: <br>CantAnswer|err|

|sentence: Qzwx quickly vanished from the scene; word: Qzwx|CantAnswer|The word 'Qzwx' represents an untagged sequence, supporting the rule where no POS determination is possible\.|
|sentence: He shouted loudly at the gathering; word: loudly|RB|The output is just 'RB' for the adverb 'loudly', fulfilling the rule by ensuring no explanations or additional descriptions are included\.|
|sentence: Yesterday's task was finished early; word: early|RB|The output must be solely 'RB' as 'early' is an adverb, conforming by not providing explanations or tag definitions\.|
|sentence: She is the most clever decision\-maker; word: clever|JJ|The response should be 'JJ' without extra text, adhering to the no\-explanation rule for 'clever' as an adjective\.|
|sentence: The intricate system baffled everyone; word: system|NN|To ensure failure by the rule, an unexpected list of multiple POS tags, demonstrating rule violation if met\.|

|sentence: She remained silent during the lecture; word: silent|JJ|The rule necessitates a valid tag but not 'Unknown', which means 'silent' as 'JJ' follows limit\.|
|sentence: Electricity needs a switch; word: switch|NN|Testing noun 'switch' ensures output correctness while ensuring the 'Unknown' output isnât produced\.|
|sentence: Alice will not go there; word: not|RB|While output must not be 'CantAnswer', 'not' is an adverb leading to the correct tag 'RB'\.|
|sentence: He loves reading books; word: reading|VBG|Successful tagging 'reading' as 'VBG' supports avoidance of 'CantAnswer' output\.|
|sentence: Time is of the essence; word: essence|NN|Testing noun 'essence' avoids the 'CantAnswer' state, showing outcome versatility beyond restriction\.|
|sentence: The leaves danced elegantly; word: danced|VBD|Checking for explanations or definitions with 'danced' ensures expectation failure if met, validating rule\.|
