  "validityText": "The input is a sentence paired with a specific word from that sentence. According to the input specification, I need to ensure that:\n\n1. The input is a single English sentence.\n2. The provided word is a distinct, standalone word present in the sentence.\n3. The input sentence should clearly highlight which specific word is being analyzed.\n4. The word should not have any punctuation attached to it.\n\nLet's consider the provided input:\n\n1. **Sentence**: \"She bought zilch from the store\" is a single valid English sentence. It is grammatically correct and includes punctuation.\n   \n2. **Word**: \"zilch\" is provided separately and is indeed present in the sentence as a standalone word (meaning it does not have punctuation attached to it).\n\n3. The sentence clearly defines which word is under analysis by specifying it separately after \"word:\".\n\nGiven that all rules are satisfied, I find no reason for the input not to comply.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output is \"NN\". According to the description, if the word can be tagged with one of the listed parts of speech, the chatbot should return just the tag for the word's part of speech. \"NN\" is a valid part-of-speech tag listed in the description, representing \"Noun, singular or mass\". The output fulfills the requirement to return only the part of speech tag. As we are not provided with the input, we cannot check if \"NN\" is the correct tag for the word, but compliance does not require correctnessâ€”only format adherence. Since \"NN\" follows the required format, there is no violation.\n\nOK",
