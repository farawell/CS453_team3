The input is structured as a sentence and identifies a specific word within it. In this case: \n   - Sentence: \"She is the most clever decision-maker;\"\n   - Word: \"clever\"\n\n2. The sentence must be a valid English sentence, which this appears to be, as it is grammatically correct and contains more than one word.\n\n3. The word specified must be present within the sentence. The word \"clever\" is indeed found in the sentence.\n\n4. The word should be a standalone word without any punctuation attached to it. In this case, the word \"clever\" does not have any punctuation attached, so it meets this requirement.\n\n5. Additionally, the word must distinguishably be the one being analyzed, which is appropriately highlighted in the input.\n\nBased on the evaluation against each of these criteria, the input satisfies all conditions laid out in the input specification.\n\nOK",
