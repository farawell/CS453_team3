The input must include a single sentence. - The input does feature a sentence: \"She remained silent during the lecture.\" This appears to be a complete and grammatically correct sentence.\n\n2. The input must clearly specify a word from that sentence. - The input does specify a word: \"silent.\"\n\n3. The sentence should contain the word specified. - The word \"silent\" is indeed present in the sentence \"She remained silent during the lecture.\"\n\n4. The specified word must be a standalone word without any punctuation attached to it. - The word \"silent\" is independent of any punctuation and appears as a standalone word.\n\n5. The word specified must be distinct and present in the sentence. - The word \"silent\" is distinct and present within the sentence.\n\nIn my analysis, all the conditions set forth by the input specification are met.
