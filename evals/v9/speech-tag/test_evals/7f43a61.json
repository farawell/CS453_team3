  "validityText": "The input provided is a sentence \"She often heard the chime of ksld\" and a word \"ksld\". To determine if this input complies with the input specification, I will review the following points:\n\n1. **Sentence Validity**: The sentence \"She often heard the chime of ksld\" is valid as it is a grammatically correct English sentence containing multiple words and includes punctuation.\n\n2. **Specific Word Presence**: The word provided \"ksld\" is clearly mentioned in the sentence, which satisfies the requirement that the word is present within the sentence.\n\n3. **Distinct and Standalone Word**: The word given \"ksld\" appears to be standalone, since there is no punctuation directly attached to it in the sentence. It is separated by spaces which means it is distinctly separated from other words and punctuations.\n\n4. **Highlight of Specific Word**: Although not explicitly stated how to highlight the specific word, the sentence should make it evident which word is being analyzed by listing it separately after \"word:\".\n\nSince all conditions specified in the input specification are met, the input is in compliance.\n\nOK",
