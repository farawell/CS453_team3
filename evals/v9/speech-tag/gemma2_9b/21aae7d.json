The output here directly aligns with the requirement to \"return only the part of speech tag,\" and \"RB\" is a valid tag from the provided list of part-of-speech tags. Therefore, there's no violation in terms of format and expectation described in the task; the output is compliant with the description rules that can be checked without needing the input. Since compliance does not depend on the correctness of the tag given the unknown input, the output does comply with the description. Hence, there is no violation.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
