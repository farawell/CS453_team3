The output should simply be the tag \"RB\" without any explanatory text. Therefore, the output does not comply with the requirement to return only the part of speech tag.\n\nThe specific violation here is the inclusion of a detailed explanation and reasoning process, which is not part of the output requirements. The description clearly states that only the part of speech tag should be returned.\n\nERR"
