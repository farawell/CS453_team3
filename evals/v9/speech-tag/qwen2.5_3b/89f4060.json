The task requires the chatbot to return only the part-of-speech tag for a given word, which it appears to have done. Without knowing the input, it is impossible to verify if this is the correct tag, but compliance doesn't check for correctness, only whether the tag is an accepted part-of-speech tag from the list. Therefore, the output meets the requirements by returning a tag from the specified list.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
