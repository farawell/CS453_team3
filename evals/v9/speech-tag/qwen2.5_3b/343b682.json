The description provides a specific set of tags that can be returned, and \"VBEG\" is not one of them. Additionally, if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, the chatbot should return \"Unknown\". Thus, the output violates the description as \"VBEG\" is neither a part of the provided list nor does it adhere to the fallback options of \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\".\n\nERR"
