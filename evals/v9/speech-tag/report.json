The alphabet \"CC\" can be misinterpreted as a part of speech tag, but it’s incorrect in context since none of the listed tags in the description align directly with this formatting.

While \"ADJECTIVE\" might be interpreted as the part of speech, the correct tag according to the guidelines should be \"JJ\", \"JJR\", or \"JJS\".
