The output is a single part-of-speech tag, which complies with the requirements to return only a tag and nothing else. There are no additional words, explanations, or deviations from the expected format. Since the description does not specify conditions that would result in a tag of \"CC\" being inappropriate without knowing the input, I cannot determine any violations based on the description alone.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
