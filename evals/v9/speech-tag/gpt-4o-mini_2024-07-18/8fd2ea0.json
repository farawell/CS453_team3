The output is correctly formatted, as it only provides the part-of-speech tag for the word and does not contain any additional information. As my evaluation does not require knowing the input, I cannot assess whether \"VB\" is the correct tag for the given word in the sentence. However, based on the compliance with the description, the output solely consisting of the tag \"VB\" aligns with the rules provided. No violations are found in terms of compliance.\n\nOK"
