However, the chatbot's output provides labels like \"Tag for\" and both a part of speech tag and an apparent context label \"Sentence: \" which deviates from the requirement to return just the tag.\n\nViolation explanation:\nThe output includes extra context beyond just the part of speech tags. The sentence and the words being tagged are included, whereas the task specifies to return only the tag. Thus, the output does not comply with the instruction of returning only the part of speech tag.\n\nERR"
