  "complianceText": "The chatbot output lists various part-of-speech tags. According to the chatbot's description, it should return only the specific part-of-speech tags listed in the given task description. However, there are violations here:\n\n1. Non-existent tags such as \"9DC\", \"9JJJR\", and \"9NSNP\" appear in the output. These tags are not part of the list provided in the chatbot description, which means they don't comply with the description that specifies the exact tags to be used.\n2. The format of including numbers or additional letters in the tags (like \"9\" before the tag) does not comply with the rule requiring \"only the part of speech tag\" without additional or modified characters or formatting.\n3. The output presents additional information in parentheses after \"9NNP\", which is not compliant, as the requirement is to return only the part of speech tag without any extra explanations or context.\n\nFor these reasons, the chatbot output does not adhere to the specified format and tag list, resulting in a violation of its description.\n\nERR"
