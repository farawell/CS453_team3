  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides multiple items, which could imply considering different options for a single word or multiple words. However, what is clear from the description is that the task requires a single part of speech tag (or 'Unknown' or 'CantAnswer' in case of specific circumstances) for a given word. The output gives three separate entries:\n\n1. \"CC: Adjective\" - This seems to be blending a tag (\"CC\") with a different part of speech (\"Adjective\").\n2. \"VB: Verb\" - This correctly associates a tag with its corresponding part of speech but doesn't provide a single, standalone tag as required.\n3. \"Unknown: CantAnswer\" - This is disallowed by the description as \"Unknown\" and \"CantAnswer\" are separate responses and should not be listed together.\n\nThe output does not comply with the guideline to return a single, specific tag or choice from the list (or 'Unknown' or 'CantAnswer'). The mixing of tags with part of speeches and joining of 'Unknown' with 'CantAnswer' violates this instruction. Therefore, the output is non-compliant.\n\nERR"
