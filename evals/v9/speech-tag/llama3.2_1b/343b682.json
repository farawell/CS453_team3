According to the task description, the evaluation should focus solely on compliance with the format and requirements given. \n\nLet's examine the compliance:\n\n1. **Format**: Emphasis should be on providing just the part-of-speech tag as specified. The output has been given with additional format information such as the sentence number and the word in context (\"reading\") repeated, which isn't specified by the task, though this does not break any explicitly listed rules because it still provides the tag directly: \"EX\".\n\n2. **Tags**: The output only provides the tag \"EX\" for both instances of the word \"reading\".\n\n3. **Part of Speech Tags**: \"EX\" is included in the list of acceptable tags, which indicates existential there. However, without input confirmation of context, it's impossible to strictly evaluate correctness of this tag.\n\nOn direct format, and given the EX tag matches the list provided in description, it meets compliance requirements for tag provision. Though unknown correctness is a caveat (given that it may not actually be EX without sentence context), it doesn't breach rule given our scope excludes functional correctness without input.\n\nNo direct violations exist based on the rules given. \n\nOK"
