  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot includes three tags: \"CC\" for Coordinating conjunction, \"JJR\" for Adjective, comparative, and \"KZWX Unknown\". According to the description, the chatbot should return only one part of speech tag that tags the word, or \"Unknown\", or \"CantAnswer\". Furthermore, any tag returned by the chatbot must be from the pre-defined alphabetical list of part-of-speech tags given in the description. The tag \"KZWX Unknown\" is not listed in the provided tag list. Additionally, the output should only contain one tag, as per the specifications in the description, but the output contains three different instances of tags, violating the rule.\n\nThinking process: The output violates the rule by including a tag \"KZWX Unknown\" which is not a valid tag from the list provided in the description. Furthermore, the chatbot is supposed to return only one tag per query. Hence, the output does not comply with the description.\n\nERR"
