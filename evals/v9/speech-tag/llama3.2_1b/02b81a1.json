  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains two different part of speech tags for the word \"moment\": MD and IN. This suggests that the chatbot has provided two conflicting tags for the same word in a single output, which violates the guideline of returning only one part of speech tag for a given word. Additionally, the correct part of speech tag for the given word should not be checked, but it should not provide two different tags for the same word. Therefore, it does not comply with the description.\n\nERR"
