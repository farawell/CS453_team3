However, the output \"CC: Conj\" does not match any of the tags listed. The tag \"CC\" is a valid tag for a coordinating conjunction, but the output includes \": Conj\", which is not part of any listed tag. The expected format based on the description is to return just the tag, without additional text. Therefore, there is a violation as the chatbot output does not comply with the description which asks for only the part of speech tag to be returned without any extra text.\n\nERR"
