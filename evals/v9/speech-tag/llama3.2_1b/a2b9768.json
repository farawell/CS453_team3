  "complianceText": "The output from the chatbot contains three elements: \"CannotAnswer\", \"CannotAnswer\", and \"Unknown\". According to the description provided, the expected responses to a sentence and word input are one of the predetermined part-of-speech tags, \"Unknown\" if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, or \"CantAnswer\" if unable to tag the word.\n\n1. \"CannotAnswer\" does not exactly match \"CantAnswer\" which is listed as the acceptable response in case the word cannot be tagged. This is a deviation from the expected tag.\n2. \"Unknown\" matches the output listed in the description for words that cannot be tagged with the provided tags, making it compliant.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- The presence of \"CannotAnswer\" is a violation because it does not match the expected \"CantAnswer\".\n- The output \"Unknown\" matches the expected tag, so it is compliant.\n\nThe presence of even one non-compliance requires returning 'ERR'.\n\nERR"
