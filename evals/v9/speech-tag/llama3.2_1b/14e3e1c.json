  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description for several reasons:\n\n1. **Invalid Tags**: The tags used in the output (PN, AD, V) do not match any of the part-of-speech tags listed in the description. The description specifies tags like PRP for pronoun, RB for adverb, and VB for verb, among others. These discrepancies indicate a violation as the output fails to conform to the given list of part-of-speech tags.\n\n2. **Missing Tags**: The output did not provide all of the required part-of-speech tags for each word. According to the description, each word should receive a tag from the given list or \"Unknown\" if none apply. The output lists only some tags (NN:Noun), but others are missing (e.g., JJ:Adjective for 'future').\n\n3. **Redundant Information**: The output provides explanations alongside each tag. However, the description requires only the part-of-speech tag to be returned, without any additional information or explanation.\n\nBased on these points, the given output does not meet the compliance criteria specified in the chatbot's description. \n\nERR"
