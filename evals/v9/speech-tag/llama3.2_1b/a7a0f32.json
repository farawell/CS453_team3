However, the output provided contains additional text (\"Tag for 'early':\") before the part of speech tag \"ADJ\". Additionally, \"ADJ\" is not a part of the list of part-of-speech tags provided in the description. The description specifies that only the given list of tags should be used. Therefore, this is a violation of the rule that requires returning only the part of speech tag and using only the listed tags.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
