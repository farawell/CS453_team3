  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output lists part of speech tags \"CC: Adverbial phrase (indicating timing or sequence)\" and \"JD: Denominate the adjective 'unprecedented' which doesn't exist on this list\", neither of which match any of the part-of-speech tags provided in the description. The tag \"CC\" seems to attempt to reference a category from the given list, but its description \"Adverbial phrase (indicating timing or sequence)\" is not correct for the tag \"CC\", which should stand for \"Coordinating conjunction\". Additionally, \"JD\" is not included in the given alphabetical list of part-of-speech tags. According to the description, if the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, it should return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\", which it failed to do. This is a clear violation of the requirement to use only the specified tags or the alternative responses when those tags cannot be applied.\n\nERR"
