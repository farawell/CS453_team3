  "complianceText": "The chatbot output lists a part-of-speech tag \"IN\" for words from two different sentences and also provides an explanation that both words can be tagged with 'IN'. According to the description, the output should only return the part of speech tag for the word's part of speech without any additional explanation. Furthermore, the description specifies that if the part of speech cannot be determined, the output should be \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\". If the chatbot's intention was to provide an output for each of two given sentences, it still violates the rule by including textual explanations (\"For the first sentence\" etc.) instead of only the required part of speech tag. Therefore, the output violates the requirement to return only the tag.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
