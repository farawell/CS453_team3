  "complianceText": "The chatbot output provides both an attempt at tagging the word \"attitude\" as NNP and a statement about identical words leading to the response 'CantAnswer'. According to the description, the chatbot should provide only the part of speech tag as the output unless it cannot be tagged, in which case it should return 'Unknown', or if the chatbot is unable to tag the word at all, it should return 'CantAnswer'. \n\nThere are two issues here:\n\n1. The chatbot output first attempts to provide a tag (\"NNP\") and then gives 'CantAnswer' due to a lack of capability to tag under specific conditions. This duality in response is not in compliance with the description which requires a single conclusive output.\n\n2. The output is not limited to just returning the part of speech tag. The description states that only the tag should be returned with no additional explanation or sentence provided. The presence of explanatory text alongside the tags does not comply with this rule.\n\nDue to these reasons, the output does not comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
