  "complianceText": "The chatbot description explicitly specifies an alphabetical list of part-of-speech tags. The provided output \"DC: Determiner\" does not match any tag in the list, indicating a deviation from the expected tags. \"JJ: Adjective\" aligns with the listed tag, but the presence of the non-compliant \"DC\" tag means the overall output does not strictly adhere to the guidelines given in the description. Therefore, the presence of \"DC\" instead of a valid tag or a return of \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" signifies a violation.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
