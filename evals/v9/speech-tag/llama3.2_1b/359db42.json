  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is \"CC: Adverb,\" which includes an explanation about the tag \"CC.\" According to the task description, the chatbot must only return the part of speech tag itself without any additional explanation or information. The description specifies to only return the tag, such as \"CC,\" \"CD,\" \"IN,\" etc., and not a combination of the tag and a definition like \"Adverb.\" Hence, by providing this additional explanation, the output violates the requirements specified by the task description.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
