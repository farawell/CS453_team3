If unable to tag, it should return \"CantAnswer.\" \n\nHowever, in the given output:\n1. The part of speech tag \"ADJ (Adjective)\" does not comply with the list of tags given in the description.\n2. The correct action of \"CantAnswer\" is presented but only after specifying an incorrect part of speech tag.\n\nThe output seems to violate the guideline which states that it should return only the part of speech tag, \"Unknown,\" or \"CantAnswer,\" but not both part of speech and \"CantAnswer.\"\n\nThinking process:\n- There is a clear non-compliance due to providing an incorrect part of speech followed by \"CantAnswer.\"\n- The term \"ADJ\" is not part of the given list of allowed part of speech tags.\n\nTherefore, the decision is that the output does not comply with the task description.\n\nERR"
