  "complianceText": "The chatbot output includes three tags: \"CC: adverb\", \"NNS: noun plurality\", and \"NNT: proper noun\". According to the description, only specified part-of-speech tags should be used. \"CC\" corresponds to \"Coordinating conjunction\" and \"NNS\" corresponds to \"Noun, plural\". These are acceptable tags, but their descriptions in the output (\"adverb\" and \"noun plurality\") are incorrect. Moreover, \"NNT: proper noun\" includes a tag (\"NNT\") that is not listed in the provided description, making it invalid. \n\nThe description clearly states to use only the specified tags and their correct meanings or return \"Unknown\" or \"CantAnswer\" if tagging is not possible. The presence of an unexpected tag and incorrect descriptions of the valid tags violates the provided rules.\n\nERR"
