  "complianceText": "The output \"NN (noun)\" is a proper part-of-speech tag format based on the task description. It provides a tag from the list provided in the description. However, the inclusion of the word \"noun\" is not in accordance with the task requirement which strictly asks to return only the part of speech tag. Thus, it should only return \"NN\" without further elaboration like \"(noun)\". This violates the rule which states to return only the part of speech tag.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
