  "complianceText": "The chatbot is expected to return only the part of speech tag. However, the initial statement \"No tag as no part of 'ksld' can be detected.\" is included alongside the tag \"CantAnswer.\" According to the instructions, only the tag should be returned. Furthermore, the instruction also mentions that if the word cannot be tagged, it should return \"CantAnswer.\" The output does include \"CantAnswer\" in the correct context, suggesting it adheres to this part of the description. However, since there is additional text before the tag which the description doesn't allow, it violates the guideline of returning only the tag.\n\nThe violation here is the inclusion of extra text before the part-of-speech tag, which is not compliant with the instruction to return only the tag.\n\nERR"
