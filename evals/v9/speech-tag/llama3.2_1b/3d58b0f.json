  "complianceText": "The output given by the chatbot needs to satisfy the requirement outlined in the description that it must return only the part of speech tag as a response for the given word. \n\nUpon examining the chatbot output:\n\n1. The first line \"CC: Noun\" does not appear to be aligned with the guidelines. The alphabet \"CC\" can be misinterpreted as a part of speech tag, but itâ€™s incorrect in context since none of the listed tags in the description align directly with this formatting. Also, it is not evident why it says \"Noun\" if it is intended as an answer, considering \"CC\" represents \"Coordinating conjunction\", not \"Noun\". This line does not seem to contain a compliant part of speech tag for a given word as per the specification.\n\n2. The third line \"WC: ADJECTIVE\" indicates a similar issue. The prefix \"WC:\" does not match any of the part of speech tags provided. While \"ADJECTIVE\" might be interpreted as the part of speech, the correct tag according to the guidelines should be \"JJ\", \"JJR\", or \"JJS\". Thus, this line also does not follow compliance since it doesn't have just the correct tag in the uppercase form, instead, it uses the word ADJECTIVE.\n\nIn both cases, the output does not strictly adhere to the format of returning just the appropriate part of speech tag from the given list. Therefore, the output violates the described requirement because it does not return just the specified part of speech tags. \n\nERR"
