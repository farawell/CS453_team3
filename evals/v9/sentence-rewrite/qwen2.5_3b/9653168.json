It creates a more engaging structure by explaining the reason why people might be scared to try a complex procedure, thereby preserving the factual meaning. The language is clear and fluid, meeting the description's criteria for enhancing readability and sounding more conversational. Since we do not have the original input, we cannot assess whether factual accuracy is preserved but can verify that language simplification and a conversational tone have been applied.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
