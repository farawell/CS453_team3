The wording is straightforward, and the phrase \"brings out all the lifelike quality\" simplifies the potential complexity of the original sentence (assuming it is more complex), making it more engaging and easier to understand. Given that I don't have the original sentence to judge the preservation of factual accuracy, the focus is solely on readability and conversational nature, which the output achieves.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
