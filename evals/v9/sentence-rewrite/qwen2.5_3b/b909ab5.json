The sentence provided, \"The long-time partnership between the two groups was founded on mutual respect and common values,\" is clear, concise, and factual. However, it lacks a more conversational tone and does not engage with the reader in the way that the description specifies, such as using simpler, relatable language or creating a fluid and engaging structure. The sentence is more formal and does not reflect a personal or conversational style that might include more fluid language or phrasing common in everyday dialogue.\n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
