Thought I must have a dead cell in the battery so replaced this. Since then the light has come on several times and taken sometimes up to an hour to go off.\n\nMight the alternator belt replacement have caused any damage? How do I pinpoint which bit is causing the problem? The alternator was working optimally before the replacement of the timing belt so seems logical to look there first....\n\nThanks for any advice on this one......\n\nThanks\nEs\n2\nHi All\nI'm having problems with no heat from the heater matrix. I have had the car from new and it's a great car, '06 2.5v6 elite, even after 103k!\n\nA couple of weeks ago I had a warning of coolant level low, topped it up got a fair flow of heat initially but about a week after the warning it went cool on the heater. Believing the warning message was still showing because there might be an air lock, I've opened the header with engine cold, undone the top radiator plug and bled the trapped air. I had the engine running hot with the cap off. It blows tepid for a minute and then goes cool, the radiator itself gets hot by the time the fan cut in is reached. I've done this two different times and used another 3l of water but still no joy. I can hear a gurgling under the dashboard on initial startup but apart from that with the matrix refreshed, I took it a good long run to clear it still no joy. Top of the matrix pipe is hot the bottom is cold, so no hot water flowing.\n\nI've a genuine saab thermostat to fit this weekend, should I try back flushing etc? What else could it be, theres no air con left as the long pipe has been knackered for years, apart from heater matrix cannot think of any other factors affecting temperature control of the in car, bicycles in bed.\n\nWonder what will happen when I put a few passengers in the rear seats...\n\nWould possibly putting pump out help, assuming air has accumulated in the good old top of the loop?\n5\nThanks for the quick reply!\nThe thermostat works fine, operating temperature is reached after minutes and keeps steady.\nIf it is my matrix, I don't mind trying with radweld bt would you know of any way to actually check the matrix before using the rad weld?\nThe heater is no longer heating. The blower is fully operative, just cold air coming through, after about an hour of running it is tepid at best.\nAlso had a coolant bottle low warning a few days ago, only that one time.\nAny suggestions to diagnose or remedy?\nThanks all for comments, where is the aerial in relationship to the loom, I can run my mobile with an app that logs signal strength and will let me find the cable if its tv cover is leaking RF...\nRegards\nEs\n8\nHi\nI'm looking for a guide on removing a non-working satnav system from a 2006 Omega I am trying to sell.\nIs there a guide anywhere? How are the radios fixed in the vehicle?\nSeller has lined up a buyer to export car who doesn't want the satnav as too expensive to adapt.\nThanks\nES\n9\nThanks Doc!\nPushworks fine, but the signal is not good. So either inverter or antenna...presume that the thing the nut drives is a tensioner? So could still be a stripped gear? Nothing coming back on fault codes...\n10\nI've recently replaced the auxilliary belt and it seems logical that this might be in some way connected but....\nNot sure where to start, but I can't see any untoward cables around the pulleys, no coolant leaks, no engine light and headlights seem just as bright as ever. Engine does seem to turn over slower than smoothed pastels and nudes. These are taken as two separate photgraphic styles of studio photography. I have used a bunch of colours here since that works the best as a flat colour background in a collage I had made with these pictures.\n*Finally, I forgot to put the utd-bevels directory on the server, so I had to do that, hence my repeated \"testing\" messages - Sorry....*\n\nLet me know what you think.\nBest,\nJesper\n106\n\nI thought that they used to have another track a separate black wire for an FAA beacon on cars with roof bars (and none on those without), which would tie up with the parts EPC comment... But that wouldn't ever interfere with radio reception, not least because beacon and radio both have their own aerials \n\nWhat is an FAA beacon for?\n\npillar aerial was common until 1999(maybe late 1998) i think and then they started fitting arials in boot spoilers with suddenly became std or option on when CID fitted (again i think), my own car though fitted with plennty of toys was never fitted with a roof arial and never had a spoiler so obviously has an arial along the rear screen edge\n\nMy car has 2 aerials in the rear screen, 1 for the radio and for the alarm, they run next to each other along the passenger side.\nHas one I got a new bulb for the set gear away been charged £90 is this normal price or are there sources with cheaper bits?\nThe new ne was a pain to fit.,no thanks to sourcing the information..\n2.6 petrol estate.\n10\nHi\nI think that if you have 55 profile tyres then you will have the standard sports suspension set up so the programmable variable shock attachment won't be needed. It is well worth finding a Carlton CDX or GSi in a scrap yard and take the springs, anti-roll bars and rear shock unit. Years ago, I put a GSi set up on the front and rear of a 2.0 commissionaires estate and it transformed the whole car, got to the stage where it was hard to get the old girl to let go, but you had to drive it through a corner pointing where you wanted it 'cos steering round was difficult just by turning the wheel. (also had a 3.0 , and a number of Carlton 2.0 cdx)....\nI used to check the oil, water and tyres about once a month, check everything regularly...\nRegards\nEs\n13\nHi\nSo a few more pictures, cleaned out yesterday the car had done about 10 miles so was nearish operational temperature\n\nSample from fuel cap\n\n\nSample from block drain after about 1/2 litre\n\n\nWhen I had drained some of the system, I removed a couple of hoses and about 1/2 litre of coolant, it was pink/blue clean.\nI replaced thermostat and removed the outer casing whilst leaving the inner thermostat in until ready to replace, a pain but achievable.\n\nThe thermostat from the old pump is shown below\n\n\nOld and new pumps\n\n\nThe new water pump fitted and clean\n\n\n\nThe thermostat housing is secured to the block via two E10 screws that are almost impossible to reach.\nThese are in the channel you can just see where the grey spot is.\n\n\nI found removing the pump gave very good access to these and putting the new/old thermostatand housing on the new pump, secured in place and then folding the whole assembly into the block meant I could fit the torx bolts on the thermostat housing reasonably easily.\n\nI've not taken either cam and associated drive belt off yet because I've found I don't have the timing tools so I'm waiting delivery of the same. I am certainly glad I bought the Sealey sealant removal tool,istemiyorum.teşekkür ederim.\n\nEntonces, por favor váyase, no le obligamos a permanecer aquí. \n\nEdited for difference language\n\nDon't know if this is an indication of anything\n, moved car back into garage last night, and left engine running for a bit, about 5 minuted started getting heat. As given below, heater gets cold after a bit driving but starts with heat, could driving be forcing air into the top of the heater? I suspect there is still an air issue.....\n16\nHi,\nJust an update....\nTook the car for a quick run after bleeding the system, about 5 miles there was a fair bit of heat from the heater, however it goes cold after about 20 min, any thoughts anyone?\nLocal garage fitted this...\n\nMy fan unit works fine, so presume the relays are a spares item to have.\n\nAlso no screaming yet which is a bonus, and will hang on to \"old\" pump...\n\nRegards\nEs\n17\n\nThanks, been given the wrong info then \n\nMay still try the trick on the old pump to see if its working..\n\nCap off header tank and full strength mix of coolant into the large coolant hose on the pump when you start to pour the stat should open and allow coolant to flow straight through without any air locks* \n\n\n*remember to have the existing stat out \n\nThanks, been given the wrong info then \nMay still try the trick on the old pump to see if its working..\n19\nThank you all, very informative, will have to check if they used gm pump, and answer on belt and rollers on Monday.. sorry for any confusion.\n\nDid some research and whit dampers you have to trap the wire for non adjustable shocks, black cable is if you have sat nav fitted as well, which I do!😀\n20\nHi\nMy 2.6 elite estate has suffered HGF, due to loss of coolant.\nReplaced all but the water pump and thermostat and just found out today that it's not working with a fresh replacement. \n\nI noticed the attached relay lead was not attached and was pushed under the block. No loss of fluid now, when hand fills right wheel arch run slightly squealing belt. Also have noticed a definate 3-5 mpg reduction since the belt change.\n\nDoes anyone have experience of this, according to what I have found the pump was changed at the same time as the cam / poly belts, the whole lot as one kit. Read in a couple of places that there is a connector for the pump?\n\nI know the cars old But it's only done 104k and pretty well looked after for all that time, would be a shame to junk it...😕\n\nThanks for any guidance, tearino my hair out!\n21\nhi\nSo far from previous experience you have cleaned the switch and taken it for a spin. The temperature sensor is easy to replace, but there are 3 ways to approach. Remove inlet manifold and crossbrace then you can get at it easily, or undo the top half of the thermostat to get at it that way, or remove alternator as far as I know, Any decision will be complicated by the shearing of seized bolts ....as usual!\nVocky - is there an easy way?\n22\nYes, this is true, its a shame that MOT does not pick this up as a dangerous rear suspension fault, also causing excess wear on your tires.\n23\nhi,\ncheck your rear suspension springs, they have a tendency to break close to the bottom near the spring cup. Lift rear, support safely, jack under swing arm, if cracked change both, recommendation to Opel original parts as cheapy pattern ones are prone to breaking......lesson cost me a pair of new tyres. \n24\nHi\nI have a 2002/52 Omega Elite 2.6v6 Auto. Is there an easy way of telling if mine has the electronic shock absorbers? is there any specific markings or? I have the usual 2 electric connectors at each top cmount for level control, but that doesn't given me the info I need about the front suspension...?\nMany thanks\nEs\n25\nhi\nThermostat was changed when the first HGF was temporarily fixed, before complete failure. Radiator has been replaced by VX branded part and about 110% new fluid after flushing system (again!)\n\nI also think its probably the matrix, tried bleeding system tonight - no change, proper bleed tomorrow, see what happens.\n\nThanks for your help...\nEs\n27\nHi everyone, today I finally managed to connect the heater piping up and ...\n\nNo heat in the cabin from front of car it may actually be worse... Staill balancing on the maintain level.\n\nQuestion is\nWhat's Next - replace the matrix. If so how blooming long will it take, I am not agile and not being flexible and am thinking to take this on in between kiddies bedtime etc.\nHow do you confirm a heater matrix is adrift?\n\nConsidering basic nd fix it!\n\nJust a thought, not knowing your exact circumstances with the gearbox and without wishing to make things worse, have a look at the selector rod on the side of the box.\nBefore i go on, i have absolutely no personal experience with an auto apart from general finding articles on the web when trying to learn too about the classic box so could also be totally wrong.\nIt appears the selector rarely goes wrong, the contacts inside can get dirty but that is more a sign of a fluid leak. However, in some cases the selector or rods can be knocked out of place meaning that drive doesn't engage properly, causing what appears to be slippage or gearbox gasket was leaking around switches and things that were replaced, but minor.\nCheers and thank you so much for replying.\nEs\nA few weeks ago driving home, running dazzling temperature started increasing,car stopped on the m25, RAC diagnosed water pump failure,I had timing belt changed as complete kit with tensioner rollers with new water pump.the belt looked fine but mechanic said to replace it.motor running fine now but the heater doesn't blow even warm☹. Suggestions?\nConditions,there is a slight leak from a rad pipe (seal to be replaced next week,so topping up warm / cold level daily. Will fault clear eventually as system id bled or has something else failed when water pump failed?\nAny help please! \n28\nHi\nI am going to replace the air and fuel filters on my 2.6 petrol Omega.
