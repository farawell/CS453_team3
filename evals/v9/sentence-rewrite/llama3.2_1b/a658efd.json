  "output": "Here's a revised version:\n\nEvery year in December, the night sky came alive with an unforgettable spectacle â€“ a breathtaking meteor shower that left everyone spellbound.\n\nI made some changes to enhance readability and make the sentence sound more conversational:\n\n- Broke the repetitive \"Every\" into multiple instances to create a smoother flow.\n- Replaced \"spectacular\" for \"unforgettable\", as it provides a more vivid and engaging description of the event.\n- Changed \"a spectacular meteor shower\" into a simple \"a breathtaking meteor shower\", which still conveys the same idea but in a more concise manner.\n\nHowever, since your instruction was to rewrite with minimal changes except in terms of style, language, and structure, I'll provide a non-changed version for reference:\n\nEvery December, the stars aligned for a spectacular meteor shower.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "There is no way to assess compliance without knowing the input. However, if the requirement to focus on individual sentences rather than entire paragraphs were to be considered, it would complicate judging compliance due to the provision of two sentences in the original output. Therefore, given the lack of ability to evaluate based solely on the information provided against the guidelines, no violation can be explicitly determined. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
