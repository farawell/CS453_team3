The blower is fully operative, just cold air coming through, after about an hour of running it is tepid at best.\nAlso had a coolant bottle low warning a few days ago, only that one time.\nAny suggestions to diagnose or remedy?\nThanks all for comments, where is the aerial in relationship to the loom, I can run my mobile with an app that logs signal strength and will let me find the cable if its tv cover is leaking RF...\nRegards\nEs\n8\nHi\nI'm looking for a guide on removing a non-working satnav system from a 2006 Omega I am trying to sell.\nIs there a guide anywhere? How are the radios fixed in the vehicle?\nSeller has lined up a buyer to export car who doesn't want the satnav as too expensive to adapt.\nThanks\nES\n9\nThanks Doc!\nPushworks fine, but the signal is not good. So either inverter or antenna...presume that the thing the nut drives is a tensioner? So could still be a stripped gear? Nothing coming back on fault codes...\n10\nI've recently replaced the auxilliary belt and it seems logical that this might be in some way connected but....\nNot sure where to start, but I can't see any untoward cables around the pulleys, no coolant leaks, no engine light and headlights seem just as bright as ever. Engine does seem to turn over slower than smoothed pastels and nudes. These are taken as two separate photgraphic styles of studio photography. I have used a bunch of colours here since that works the best as a flat colour background in a collage I had made with these pictures.\n*Finally, I forgot to put the utd-bevels directory on the server, so I had to do that, hence my repeated \"testing\" messages - Sorry....*\n\nLet me know what you think.\nBest,\nJesper\n106\n\nI thought that they used to have another track a separate black wire for an FAA beacon on cars with roof bars (and none on those without), which would tie up with the parts EPC comment... But that wouldn't ever interfere with radio reception, not least because beacon and radio both have their own aerials \n\nWhat is an FAA beacon for?\n\npillar aerial was common until 1999(maybe late 1998) i think and then they started fitting arials in boot spoilers with suddenly became std or option on when CID fitted (again i think), my own car though fitted with plennty of toys was never fitted with a roof arial and never had a spoiler so obviously has an arial along the rear screen edge\n\nMy car has 2 aerials in the rear screen, 1 for the radio and for the alarm, they run next to each other along the passenger side.\nHas one I got a new bulb for the set gear away been charged £90 is this normal price or are there sources with cheaper bits?\nThe new ne was a pain to fit.,no thanks to sourcing the information..\n2.6 petrol estate.\n10\nHi\nI think that if you have 55 profile tyres then you will have the standard sports suspension set up so the programmable variable shock attachment won't be needed. It is well worth finding a Carlton CDX or GSi in a scrap yard and take the springs, anti-roll bars and rear shock unit. Years ago, I put a GSi set up on the front and rear of a 2.0 commissionaires estate and it transformed the whole car, got to the stage where it was hard to get the old girl to let go, but you had to drive it through a corner pointing where you wanted it 'cos steering round was difficult just by turning the wheel. (also had a 3.0 , and a number of Carlton 2.0 cdx)....\nI used to check the oil, water and tyres about once a month, check everything regularly...\nRegards\nEs\n13\nHi\nSo a few more pictures, cleaned out yesterday the car had done about 10 miles so was nearish operational temperature\n\nSample from fuel cap\n\n\nSample from block drain after about 1/2 litre\n\n\nWhen I had drained some of the system, I removed a couple of hoses and about 1/2 litre of coolant, it was pink/blue clean.\nI replaced thermostat and removed the outer casing whilst leaving the inner thermostat in until ready to replace, a pain but achievable.\n\nThe thermostat from the old pump is shown below\n\n\nOld and new pumps\n\n\nThe new water pump fitted and clean\n\n\n\nThe thermostat housing is secured to the block via two E10 screws that are almost impossible to reach.\nThese are in the channel you can just see where the grey spot is.\n\n\nI found removing the pump gave very good access to these and putting the new/old thermostatand housing on the new pump, secured in place and then folding the whole assembly into the block meant I could fit the torx bolts on the thermostat housing reasonably easily.\n\nI've not taken either cam and associated drive belt off yet because I've found I don't have the timing tools so I'm waiting delivery of the same. I am certainly glad I bought the Sealey sealant removal tool,istemiyorum.teşekkür ederim.\n\nEntonces, por favor váyase, no le obligamos a permanecer aquí. \n\nEdited for difference language\n\nDon't know if this is an indication of anything\n, moved car back into garage last night, and left engine running for a bit, about 5 minuted started getting heat. As given below, heater gets cold after a bit driving but starts with heat, could driving be forcing air into the top of the heater? I suspect there is still an air issue.....\n16\nHi,\nJust an update....\nTook the car for a quick run after bleeding the system, about 5 miles there was a fair bit of heat from the heater, however it goes cold after about 20 min, any thoughts anyone?\nLocal garage fitted this...\n\nMy fan unit works fine, so presume the relays are a spares item to have.\n\nAlso no screaming yet which is a bonus, and will hang on to \"old\" pump...\n\nRegards\nEs\n17\n\nThanks, been given the wrong info then \n\nMay still try the trick on the old pump to see if its working..\n\nCap off header tank and full strength mix of coolant into the large coolant hose on the pump when you start to pour the stat should open and allow coolant to flow straight through without any air locks* \n\n\n*remember to have the existing stat out \n\nThanks, been given the wrong info then \nMay still try the trick on the old pump to see if its working..\n19\nThank you all, very informative, will have to check if they used gm pump, and answer on belt and rollers on Monday.. sorry for any confusion.\n\nDid some research and whit dampers you have to trap the wire for non adjustable shocks, black cable is if you have sat nav fitted as well, which I do!😀\n20\nHi\nMy 2.6 elite estate has suffered HGF, due to loss of coolant.\nReplaced all but the water pump and thermostat and just found out today that it's not working with a fresh replacement. \n\nI noticed the attached relay lead was not attached and was pushed under the block. No loss of fluid now, when hand fills right wheel arch run slightly squealing belt. Also have noticed a definate 3-5 mpg reduction since the belt change.\n\nDoes anyone have experience of this, according to what I have found the pump was changed at the same time as the cam / poly belts, the whole lot as one kit. Read in a couple of places that there is a connector for the pump?\n\nI know the cars old But it's only done 104k and pretty well looked after for all that time, would be a shame to junk it...😕\n\nThanks for any guidance, tearino my hair out!\n21\nhi\nSo far from previous experience you have cleaned the switch and taken it for a spin. The temperature sensor is easy to replace, but there are 3 ways to approach. Remove inlet manifold and crossbrace then you can get at it easily, or undo the top half of the thermostat to get at it that way, or remove alternator as far as I know, Any decision will be complicated by the shearing of seized bolts ....as usual!\nVocky - is there an easy way?\n22\nYes, this is true, its a shame that MOT does not pick this up as a dangerous rear suspension fault, also causing excess wear on your tires.\n23\nhi,\ncheck your rear suspension springs, they have a tendency to break close to the bottom near the spring cup. Lift rear, support safely, jack under swing arm, if cracked change both, recommendation to Opel original parts as cheapy pattern ones are prone to breaking......lesson cost me a pair of new tyres. \n24\nHi\nI have a 2002/52 Omega Elite 2.6v6 Auto. Is there an easy way of telling if mine has the electronic shock absorbers? is there any specific markings or? I have the usual 2 electric connectors at each top cmount for level control, but that doesn't given me the info I need about the front suspension...?\nMany thanks\nEs\n25\nhi\nThermostat was changed when the first HGF was temporarily fixed, before complete failure. Radiator has been replaced by VX branded part and about 110% new fluid after flushing system (again!)\n\nI also think its probably the matrix, tried bleeding system tonight - no change, proper bleed tomorrow, see what happens.\n\nThanks for your help...\nEs\n27\nHi everyone, today I finally managed to connect the heater piping up and ...\n\nNo heat in the cabin from front of car it may actually be worse... Staill balancing on the maintain level.\n\nQuestion is\nWhat's Next - replace the matrix. If so how blooming long will it take, I am not agile and not being flexible and am thinking to take this on in between kiddies bedtime etc.\nHow do you confirm a heater matrix is adrift?\n\nConsidering basic nd fix it!\n\nJust a thought, not knowing your exact circumstances with the gearbox and without wishing to make things worse, have a look at the selector rod on the side of the box.\nBefore i go on, i have absolutely no personal experience with an auto apart from general finding articles on the web when trying to learn too about the classic box so could also be totally wrong.\nIt appears the selector rarely goes wrong, the contacts inside can get dirty but that is more a sign of a fluid leak. However, in some cases the selector or rods can be knocked out of place meaning that drive doesn't engage properly, causing what appears to be slippage or gearbox gasket was leaking around switches and things that were replaced, but minor.\nCheers and thank you so much for replying.\nEs\nA few weeks ago driving home, running dazzling temperature started increasing,car stopped on the m25, RAC diagnosed water pump failure,I had timing belt changed as complete kit with tensioner rollers with new water pump.the belt looked fine but mechanic said to replace it.motor running fine now but the heater doesn't blow even warm☹. Suggestions?\nConditions,there is a slight leak from a rad pipe (seal to be replaced next week,so topping up warm / cold level daily. Will fault clear eventually as system id bled or has something else failed when water pump failed?\nAny help please! \n28\nHi\nI am going to replace the air and fuel filters on my 2.6 petrol Omega.

Given that maintaining the factual accuracy is part of the requirements, this deviates from it. The description mandates that the original meaning and factual accuracy should be preserved, and such detail is an essential piece of factual content.\n\nSecondly, the changes made should aim at simplifying complex phrases and enhancing readability, which seems to have been achieved with phrases like \"symbiotic relationship\", \"strong foundation of shared objectives\", and \"intrinsic loyalty\". The adjustments are aimed at clarity and flow, and to some extent, this is accomplished. Note, however, that some elements introduced such as \"symbiotic relationship\" can still be considered somewhat complex in language, which contrasts with the goal of making the sentence more conversational.\n\nFinally, the evaluation ultimately focuses on ensuring that the original meaning is preserved while improving the structure. The change in the length of the partnership undermines the factual accuracy, which is a critical violation.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the chatbot's output does not fully comply with the description requirements, particularly in preserving factual accuracy due to altering the length of the collaboration.\n\nERR",

However, without the original input, we cannot completely childless Korean women). The survey question asked the women why they thought some women remained childless. More than half of the women (52 per cent) answered‘out of choice’ (Park et al. 1987:102) which indicates social disapproval. The other leading responses on prime causes for childlessness were: ‘Due to women’s infertility’(47 per cent) and ‘Job-oriented women’ (32 per\n38 per cent agreed with this leading response—disapproval of childlessness—whereas 38 per cent of childless women ticked ‘Personal reasons’as did 31 and 32 per cent of women with children, respectively. 38 per cent of women with one child responded ‘not diligent in keeping house’. Japanese Most Japanese women believe that it is ‘unnatural’or ‘inappropriate’in some way for a woman to remain childless.\nAmong the leading responses to this question in a 1998 opinion survey included statements such as ‘marriage should be with the aim to have and raise children’(66 per cent overall, but 87 per cent of 31-40 year olds agreed) (Kikuzawa 1999:116); ‘Having children is natural for women’(62 per cent overall with 78 per cent of 31-40 year olds agreeing) (Kikuzawa 1999:116); and ‘A married couple should have children, even if they don’t want to’(35 per cent overall agreed, including 37 per cent of 31-40 year olds) (Kikuzawa 1999:116). Seventeen per cent believe that ‘there is no problem’if a couple chooses to marry but be childless (Kikuzawa 1999:116). If public opinion mirrors private perceptions, it is little wonder that the proportion of Japanese women who voluntarily choose to be childless remains very small (Table 2.2); single women may prefer to remain unmarried in order to avoid the public disapproval of being married but childless.\nAgain the difference between genders could be much greater than indicated. Results are from a mail survey distributed to 5,000 married women aged 23 to 49 (responses were from 58 per cent of those polled).

The attitude that ‘A fulfilling marriage does not require that a woman must have children’had majority support. Other questions regarding working wives’holiday activity choices or who should take primary responsibility for household chores, however, gave responses showing much smaller support for more ‘liberal’concepts of a woman’s role (less than 40 per cent agreed). These contradictions indicate that although Japanese women are aware of and may be sympathetic to different choices and points of view for women, in practice they rarely exercise such alternatives.\nThis finding might indirectly reflect their recognition of the ‘structure of educational expansion, family and gender roles and the labour market’which disadvantages women (defined in terms of what is good for children and the family) (Kikuzawa 1999:118). Hence, women are squeezed into being (limited) providers and full-time carers for their families, despite wanting other things like being in economic charge and independ\nTable 2.2 Proportion of females remaining childless (%) 1970–2000\nSource : Retrospective surveys, 1955–70; other years, national censuses (1970–90, 2000 Population Census Long Form).

Some people insist that writing a ?thank you? note to acknowledge wedding gifts is just one more symptom of a more general development: “Evidence suggests a mounting diffusion of ideas about acceptable family living that is producing convergence in family systems across developed societies” (2002:431). Alongside the emergence of a Western ‘international social capital system’, a parallel decline in what we may call ‘traditional social order’signals a reduction, worldwide, in adherence to traditional familial and religious collectivism, and an increase in ‘the acceptance of diversity in families and of individual autonomy’(2002:431).\nCamilla quote here:\nHoteru (hotels) for an hour to fulfill sexual desire! 69 69 We stayed with my mother-in-law, and the only way we can have sex and have a baby is to have love-making one night in a hotel. My husband has to give an explanation to my mother-in-law each time why we leave the house for the night, and she believes him for now, but I guess, if she discovers that I am intentionally childless, she will all get worked up about it and pester us.\nTherefore, in order to evade the nagging, I have my love-making in a hotel with my partner.\nDespite its appeal, the notion of ‘choice’ 70 in the guise of ‘individualistic rational actors who maximize their life satisfaction’ may be an ideal (or perhaps Josselson’s (2000:88) ‘emerging consensus on the Western cultural tenets of “universal individuation”’), rather than ‘the reality’.70 It becomes clear that the issue of voluntary childlessness, and the decision to marry in Japan, is women’s desire for control, a need that post-industrial women worldwide are seeking (e.g., see Towler and Williams 1991).\nIndividualistic explanations\nso_diffuse acrosst=1 Differing patterns of fertility and childlessness Anita ?\nIndividualisation\nequal citizenship, control). Woollett and Boyle (2000:3) note of western societies, “it becomes empirically evident that we do not yet live in non-discriminatory societies. Even though many women will believe in gender equality as a principle and as a right, their practices may not reflect that belief. This is particularly apparent in the domain of family/household and employment contexts”. Such contradictions between women’s desires to be autonomous and empowered, and to have a career, and exercise their fertility, and their pursuit of choices that leave them disempowered, a housewife but not necessarily a mother, testify to what Giddens (1991) describes as the tensions between formal and substantive equality among western women. This supports the thesis that women do not fully take advantage of the choices available to them; hence, if Japan follows the path of Europe, delayed childbearing and iron roofs may become endemic.\nMamman concludes his article on Japanese fertility behaviour in the late twentieth century by saying that delayed marriage, consignment to part-time working or being a full-time housewife all contribute to the problem of childlessness (both volutionary and involutionary) among Japanese women (1999:91). Furthermore, he highlights employed women’s lack of equal economic opportunity in the workplace due to discrimination, and of equal treatment within marriage given the embedded patriarchal nature of Japanese families, as two of the main contributing factors in voluntary childlessness in Japan.\nConclusion\nThis chapter discussed the attributes of peripheral childless women and contextualised voluntary and involuntary demands of Korean women for childlessness. Providing a review of previous studies on childlessness in Korea, this chapter discussed various forms and options of childlessness—voluntary, involuntary, temporary and destiny-based—and continued with the contextualisation of current trends in Korea given a simultaneous rise in female employment alongside childbearing, as well an exploration of the notion of ‘choice’within the issue of voluntary childlessness.\nThe following four chapters (conglomerate ‘reflexivity’) offer an analysis of emergence of\n70 ‘Each individual constantly works at decisions on the basis of the best available information as to the purity of his or her own life. What to do? How to act? How to be? These are focal questions for everyone living in circumstances of late modernity—and are\nthis trend from a comparative perspective, delving deeper into women’s lived experiences by addressing these questions:\n• Why did the informants remain childless? Was it fate, a conscious choice or were they too busy doing something else? • Other than socio-economic factors, what might have shaped that behaviour? • How were/are they treated by their (male) partner, parents and society at large? • What are their opinions regarding their own childlessness? • Does gender-inequality contribute to voluntary childlessness? raised in a context where there are no firm or abiding frameworks of values and meaning”(Giddens 1991: 82).\nCHAPTER THREE\nSTORIES OF NOT HAVING CHILDREN: SCHOOLS, FAMILIES AND\nEMPLOYMENT\nIntroduction\nRespondents presented their life experiences in a variety of ways; first they presented their personal histories, and mostly began with their relationships with their parents.\nThen they moved on to situations with their husbands or partners, and lastly their working environments—themes which comprise this chapter.\nContributions from other respondents are liberally scattered throughout the chapters dealing with reflexivity because these themes form a major aspect of their voluntary childlessness. Significantly, despite the fact that there were almost twice as many Korean informants as Japanese, issues of education, parents, employment, success and sacrifice featured far more strongly in the narratives of Korean informants. This is somewhat surprising as Japan has a reputation of being a notorious example of female childbearing and educational sacrifices and constraints but perhaps it further indicated the greater strength of gender-regressive policies in Korea. An alternative explanation that cannot be entirely discounted is that the gender issue may have been less apparent because of Mariko’s presence at the Japanese interviews as it is possible that respondents may have felt reluctant to express some ‘gender differences’. Furthermore, perhaps they responded to what they assumed was expected of them.\nWhen speaking about themselves, respondents first gave details about their education before proceeding to talk about other aspects of their formative development, unprompted by the researcher.\nEducation\nKorean\nBoys over Girls\nEducational goals in patný dokumenta ní záznam a nespecifikovanými druhy dokumentace (nap íklad místy jsou úryvky z p sobivého rozhovoru parafrázovány, a už vícemén , místy mén pak nejsou dialogy synchronizovány).

Táto akcia je’s informal networks function in the absence of large kin unit. It replaces the size of family, as chosen individuals become family members.\nI would argue that the expansion and diversification of networks, for instance, have resulted in decreased childbearing among some Korean women, whose high level of education and struggles in entering Japan’s employment structure as part of an international labour force colours their perceptions of motherhood. Working women in Korea are further supported by the presence of education consulting agencies— haggwon— that work hard to prepare students for the high school examination and, thus, university entrance. The Korean government’s support for educational autonomy through the allocation of financial resources to educational institutions did not only help the proportion of working women to increase, it also began ‘to\nchange family members’expectations on marriage (such as desired family size)’(Tsuya and Choe 1991:10–11).\nThis demonstrates the role of significant others in agents’actions. For example, attempts to be a ‘good’Korean daughter and wife have resulted in some deaths in giving life to babies (Choe and Park 2006; Soromon 1997), a goal that is consonant with the socialist ideal of the Chinese (Fong, 2002).\nAll of these demonstrations or examples are complex, but I raise some of these issues when exploring female Korean respondents’for their responses to interview questions and to some of the issues they happened to mention.\nThe Structural Backgrounds for Childlessness among Japanese and Korean Women\nIn order to explore the cultural and structural contexts within which voluntary childlessness occurs for women, I turn to a selection of narratives from interviews largely related to the late twentieth century and during the 1990s, from Korean women and men and from Japanese women.\nAs mentioned in the literature review, social attitudes toward childlessness in Korea are highly gendered and situate individuals’‘choices’in their relationships with family members and, increasingly, society and culture. The Korean case focuses much more on the negatives facing the individual’s choices about having children or remaining voluntarily childless. Hence, discussions about parents, husbands and work environments for Korean women can be seen more as insightful narratives about why\nmany actively choose to be childless rather than a discussion of choice.\nWith Japan, voluntarily childless individuals exercised their choice much more freely\nthan Korean informants. As illustrated in the narratives, Japanese female informants rarely confronted the same level of familial expectations and barriers or resulting guilt that their Korean counterparts reported to me. Even those who reported conflict with their parents generally described the situation more along the lines of differences of opinion rather than the drama expressed in the Korean narratives. Certainly some Japanese went against parental wishes to raise children or married into a family on the understanding that there would be some freedom beyond child-rearing. With this in mind, analysis of Japanese informants’responses follows a section on Korean women.\nKorean married women’s experiences\nLife without children could easily have led to long, detailed accounts about their contribution to womanhood through motherhood, their childcare stories alongside the simple claim that ‘not having had children was not their fault’. They were, after all, innocent standbys seeking motherhood but it was not meant to be. Instead, they offered romantic attachments to their parents and husbands as partners in their childless journeys. For all of my informants, their narrating was definitely an experience-based exercise with all its symbolic complexity. For them, finding a language of expression was not easy; their expressions were often jumbled with many unmet feelings throughout the interviews. From here, I have chosen five Korean women’s stories: similar experiences were identified in KajyokUi Jyushonjutaecha (2000).\nThe power of “jeong” is a\nrelentless force- like a huge\nmountain or an ocean wave—\ndriving women into\nmothrehood.\n70 In their efforts to gain acceptance and to belong, individuals—or modern- day family units—they end up in a less than ideal situation in which ‘[t]hey are unable to fully embrace individualistic values because ofthe structural constraints they face—women’s role as caregivers, their obligations to in-laws, and limited employment opportunities have not changed as fast as attitudes among men.\nConsequently, women negotiate unfinished revolutions as they attempt to synthesize formal and substantive equality. They experiment in reflexive ways that smooth over the conflicts between the individualistic orientation and a social system that has not changed completely to match the new values’ (Kikuzawa 1999:116).\nWith the longest marriage (21 years), Sujin may be the oldest informant in the Korean cohort. With a BSc in food engineering, she worked as an applied engineer in a research position as well as holding teaching and consulting work in this area. She had married, but had no children—a situation considered deviant for a person of her age and experience (H-SK-F2). As an 18-year-old, she became aware and was told (by her mother) about her father’s resistance to her parents.\n70 Moffitt uses the generic sense of the term ‘choice’to suggest exercising are the capacity to reflect in a detached manner (akin to value clarification used in therapy). This reflects Western liberal democracy ideals of choice* that is, through individuation and self—reflexivity, a woman should be able to choose whether she wants to have children—and seemingly contradicts sociological analysis of bounded/ reflexivity (for example, Beck 1994).\nFamily background\nKorean women's narratives started with reflections on their parents’attitudes and values toward childbearing to demonstrate that these influenced their own choices. All of the participating women felt pressures from their working parents, suggesting that the obligations imposed by their families were burdensome. Each believed that if she had spent less time fulfilling these roles, she might have found having children much easier to achieve. It was the insufficiency of her personal efforts to fulfil responsibility to her parents or ‘filial piety’that stimulated ‘guilt’for these women. The language of‘must obey’confession evidences the entrenched expectations of women’s social role.\nNone of the Korean respondents saw motherhood in itself as an anti—modern restriction. In the Korean sample, however, five women made cultural connections between their own experience and. 서론에서 검토했듯이 이장섭(2004)은 한국 사회에서 나타나고 있는 초저출산 현상은 남성 중심의 가족 형태로부터 탈피해서 나타난 현상이라고 지적한바 있다.(p139).\nSome other interviews show the same pattern as these narratives illustrate, but I have used the selected respondents to describe the broad range of issues (and dynamics) within families so as to not be repetitive.\nFirstly, the introduction of useful terms that explain the Korean context and atmosphere in both structure and agency (autonomy, power and authority, boundary, career success, are introduced and discussed.\nOur mothers’ life Corresponding with ideas in the literature72 these subjects recounted their life stories by referring to their mothers' daily sacrifices while caring for their family. The women I met wanted to break free from the restricted domesticity of mothers’lives, which entailed sexual division of labour,73 where they were required to bear and nurture, look after the elderly and be dependent on their husband.74 The patterns were so much the same in each narrative that although I only use a few Korean illustrative examples here, they highlight shared beliefs and practices common to Korean women. They show how these women with educated parents grew up and consciously attempted to modify the traditional attitudes of their mothers. These constraints can assist us in understanding women’s pronatalism within the contemporary power structure.\nChoices, contradictions and consequences\nMongolian Barbeque --“saengshit-nun\naraniya” (must give birth) --\ni. Sister-in-law Choi's \"fate\" It was not meant to be, but still the in-laws tortured\nme with their hurtful words.\nAlthough husbands are often aware of their wives’ desires for professional and personal independence, this does not rule out marriages entered into on this basis: there is still an expectation from in-laws that the woman must bear children (male children are still preferred). Some Korean women’s narratives testify that childbearing is an expectation for women—regulated through a complex cultural belief system and daily\n72 ‘The three great “post”-related clusters(capitalism, individualism and globalization)constitute the structural environment with which motivational changes have to mesh as people develop active projects of self. In country after country, it is increasingly the case that no fixed assumptions (expressed through traditional beliefs or psychological theory) can determine life-style action’ (Giddens 1999:73). 73 gender 차이\n74 On expanding women's roles to include working outside the home, see Chai and Choi (1997), on Korean middle-class experience.\ninteractions. Whereas childbearing may be of little importance to the individual woman and may be perceived as beyond her control (e.g., biology), particular familial bonds and networks exercise a degree of control in terms of imposing motherhood on Korean wives.75 There are many attempts to redefine ‘woman’and expand ‘womanhood’* to include attributes other than wife, mother (Josselson 1996). Korean women view higher education and employment as a way to achieve personal empowerment and autonomy. Whether they have chosen to be childless, been involuntarily ‘childless’or are temporarily childless, nearly all Korean women crave control over their lives. They are constrained, not only by their childhood observations and experiences, but also by their husbands (or partners), in-laws, extended families and culture; reflexivity in pursuing change may be the more compelling motivation than ‘choice’for Korean married women to remain childless. Informants often viewed themselves as having little or no choices.\nA vast literature on contemporary family life indicates that women around the world are embracing alternative roles that offer greater independence and autonomy away from childbearing and marriage (Chai and Choi 1997; Choe 1987; Dubeck and Dunn 2002; McDonald 2002; Presser 2000). Korean society is increasing individualistic and undergoing similar changes but still embodies traditional cultural values such as ‘Confucian habits’, that continue to shape the choices women make. In the following chapter, I will give a cross-comparison of Korean women’s accounts in order to demonstrate how their upbringing has influenced their career choices, and the impact of this on their ‘agency’to remain voluntarily child-free in the contemporary context of South Korea.\n75 If the Korean cultural ethos prioritizes collectivistic actions, then such behavioural and cultural codes ensure (Korean) social system of family, workplace and networks. The feminist perspective sees these social and cultural realities as indicating continued gendered inequality policies in Korea. There is some indication that reinterpreting these power practices(labour demands) (or the structural\nstructures of expectation. It is an issue of dissonance (a disconnection or lack of harmony with cultural demands and meanings), but exemplifies issues of ‘reflexive making ofreproductive meaning’ in broader terms of transitions and transformations in the culture.\nSister-in-law Choi is in her mid-40s, was briefly married, childless, lives with her husband’s family. Her husband travels on business and visits ‘sometimes’. She is currently studying educational administration. Although she did not choose her current situation, she has developed a successful career and a supportive extended family and consistent with the findings of others (Hakim 2003:53). Sister-in-law Choi considers her family background to have played an important informative influence:\n\nMy mother was a typical Korean wife, indeed a very traditionally virtuous woman. My father had to teach from morning till dusk to feed the family. We lived like that and were accustomed enough to the lack of money. It was the burden that my parents had to live with, doing their best to support us, and they did so throughout.\n\nBecause of the power of jeong, which overshadows her earlier life, Choi makes her own independent decisions. However, dually consistent with assertions that Korean women remain traditional in their expectations and personal relationships, they are often encumbered structurally, for instance by parents and in-laws who exercise the concepts of jeong and hyo over them. In speaking of her own desires, she considered her own career advancement first before committing herself to childbearing, an uncommon practice in Korea, although it is becoming increasingly more accepted (Chai and Choi 1977:21)\n\nI chose my career over everything else. If I had stayed in the countryside after high school, I probably could have been married at least to two different men and had about four kids. That’s what life deals you in the countryside. So I came to Pusan to escape that…only my parents think this was my fate, which I see differently.\nChoi describes how her family felt her plight was an issue of fate, a cultural view prevalent in Korean society (Hawley and Kim2003; Kato 1970), yet Choi differentiated her own parents are as follows:\nAnnyeong (Hi), I'm Choi xxx. I am 46 years old this time next year. Oh, my\ngoodness. I think I am a jigeop (fuck-up)! Even saying my age sounds bad! 76 I got\nmarried quite recently and now I am not sure whether it was a good thing or a bad\nthing, as I have to live with my in-laws because of my husband’s job. What do you\nthink? (giggles)\nWell, I will talk about my parents. My mother was quite a strong person herself and\nshe had five children. [She named them]. She married my father, her cousin from\nthe same family. It was an arranged marriage. My grandparents on both sides\nwanted my parents to get married because of their business (which sold stuff to the\ngovernment) and they thought that marriage would remain within their family. As\nyou can imagine, my mother was never an equal partner in marriage due to my\nfather being a jae-u (oldest or one who took over the role of first son)76. All\ndecisions including having children, household budgets, housework, all of these\nwere determined by my father’s family.\nKorean women are frequently alienated in marriage through their relationships with the husband’s family, and they remain vulnerable in a Confucian society when they choose to oppose pressure to bear children. For instance, Choi never mentioned feeling angry with her husband over a lack of a child. Yet, despite the pressure to become a mother, she was given choices—not by her husband although he knew about the agreement—but from her in-laws, accordingly:\nHowever, like so many things, eventually people also change, and I guess my\nparents are getting modernized and westernised, and lost the Korean values they\nhave taught us. But, some things are still strong and influential in them, and\nespecially in respect of that [having children]. She often mentions that no matter\nwhat values she will have in the future, if you are a woman94, you should marry and\nhave children. In 논개's time77, they were obliged to kill themselves for husbands,\nand now we even cannot have children?’They were happy to let me be part of their\nfamily—despite not being able to deliver—, and they love me dearly. I just fulfil my\nother expected role, which is the carer of the in-laws. I think it is happy that I earned my tertiary education and said she does not think that the child is the only issue that I should worry about.My father's work was also very demanding. If I was not\neducated as I am now, I would have remained long a women stuck in a family,\nas her ‘wife’and ‘mother’. My current trouble is marriage and having to give birth.\nBut I do not think I want to do that! My mother could not control the number of\nchildren she bore and had five,6 unlike me; I am not going to go along with what my\nparents or in-laws want, particularly not if I had to live like my mother, that is, as\na wife always in service of her husband and all of us. I want to stay childless! 돈,자식, 집–하여간 한국 여성으로서 살아간다는건 쉬은 일이아니예요.제\nBoth of the above informants, too, consider their parents as main triggers: Jin’s parents were supportive of her wanting to earn a higher level tertiary education, but, consistent with the previous narrative, her in-laws’conservative attitudes put pressure on her to fulfil a ‘traditional’feminine role. Exiling herself overseas was a strategy that manifested a reluctance to subscribe to these very roles and expectations: good wife, mother and carer—and demonstrated an effort to distance from and break free of them.\nBy contrast, Young strongly esteemed her mother’s ‘strength’, but was prepared to disappoint her because of the burden she felt she had borne through traditional cultural practices and expectations. It is extraordinary to understand from Young’s story, that\n76 ‘장남 자기의 – though usually swas managed by subordinating the wife rather than through affinity, these stories below recount experiences that suggest how extensive familial control over women was.\ndespite the extensive communal pressure exerted through jeong aimed at regulating (obligating) women into childbearing, she has pursued her own empowerment across the course of a complex and sometimes painful life.\nIt was mum who always said, ‘Women should have a baby’and they should not ‘d iveorce’. This is because she sacrificed herself for us! As you know, old people laughing at you or sometimes bitch at you, when you are not married at my age. Of course, my husband sometimes doesn’t seem to keen on my\nchildlessness. You know, husbands have eyes and ears too. I came here before things turned messy. …you know when you don’t want to do something [such as being a traditional mother], you have to get away. Well, that’s my tip for other women anyhow!. 저희 어머니는 항상 “여자는 결혼해서 애를 낳아야한다”그런 말 많이\n하셨어요. 한국에서는 나처럼 이렇게 늦게 결혼한 거는 좀 수근수근 그럴 수도\n있지만 그래도 제 하고 싶은 것을 해주시는 부모님이죠. 어머니는 좀 강하신\n요즘 한국처럼 여자가 독립하면 인생이 편하다는 생각이었어요. 물론 남을 못낳는 상황에서 시댁이나 집의 기대를 실망스럽게 했어요. 미국에 온것도 어머님의 희망사항이지 제 상각은 대학공부를 갖게 하기위해서 대학졸업이후에는 결혼해서 애를 낳는게 제 의무라고 생각하죠. 한국에서 여자는 남편과 가정을 돌보면서 후사를 봐야되고 맞벌이를 한다고해도 어머니처럼 종속되었죠. 저는 그런데 질색이었어요.\n여성이라서 인생에 있어서 길이 없다고 보기 보다는 성취감을 느끼기가 힘들죠! 미국나온것도깊게생각을많이해야된다고여겼어요.\nReflecting upon silence and nonverbal communication as its expression, and the oftenperceived strong relationship between mother and child, demonstrates the power of\njeong. As previous analyses have noted, these ‘motivational processes’stemming from Korean familial structures are important factors in giving context to decisions to remain childless. In both Korea and Japan, women still mainly take responsibility for child caring, which has prolonged the duration of their homemaking years. As more career opportunities increase, however, women areellschaft’ and more like ไทยไท (the real Thai identity). If we talk about social fragmentation tapping into the above ‘unfixed assumptions’(Giddens 1999) they could be seen as central to removing the parenthood regime and reimagining a new place for themselves as women. These women were conscious of global and local pressures; asserting themselves individuistically through alternate pathways, such as career aspirations separate from any desire for\nmothering, and refusing the dictates and expectations of their families and wider social networks. However, these women, while benefiting from educational expansion and growing into role responsibilities, faced the contradictions accompanying ‘new’responsibilities while being expected to remain as ‘woman at home’they observed their mothers to perform.\nThey are haunted by this contradictory construction of their ‘choices’explicitly or implicitly. For instance, Choi placed a positive spin on her situation—her resilience and dedication in acquiring professional credentials helped her cope and make a satisfying life. Young was equally reflective but vacillated between selfdeprecation and an understanding that her life enactments thus far were responses to the demands and expectations she had had imposed on her by society and her parents, despite her efforts to claim ‘modernity’. Nevertheless, she is proud of her strength and potentially looks forward to the upcoming journey as a married woman:\nLet me talk about me now. You asked me about why I do not have a child; well I just\ndo not have one.

That, at least, was the experience recorded by my informants who had come to work in Japan, as the following quotes from the narrative of self-defined ‘voluntary childless’ show:\nEducation as a goal in itself was the informant’s first step towards claiming her autonomy, despite her mother’sand patriarchal Korea’s insistence on a traditional vision of a woman as wife and mother, one which prioritises family and childbearing opposite their ‘individual’or ‘public’life. According to the narrative of the informant, transnational movement from Korea to Japan was a successful move for both personal realisation and toward family cohesiveness, despite remaining childless. Further, jeong\nremained a guiding principle affecting her choices: socially perceived as powerless and a ‘failure’as she was not living up to the ideal, nevertheless, by using jejong she articuates her subjectthe power she questions and contests that which is expected of her.\nPower and authority within patriarchal family “women are always dependent, confirms the importance of understanding low fertility through structural changes:\nDuring the late twentieth century in Korea, there was conflict between the traditional model of family and ideals of egalitarian friendship as marriage,\nadequacy of causal analysis in understanding radical shifts in childbearing. The image of purely isolated, calculating individuals overlooks the contradictions between role prescriptions for men and women that women have inherited and the imperatives of gender equality (McDonald 2000:436; Giddens 1999 1991; Fong 2002).\ngrounded on education, which emerged during the modernization\nprocess. As Korean society exhibited two major reasons for decreasing\nferticide in Asia, but given the strong pattern of female infanticide and daughter\nneglect (in favour of sons) in India, it is reasonable to expect rates of infecundity to be higher among Indian women, given lengthy childbearing histories (Gupta 1994 in the Engendering the fertility31\nzitaran), ‘traditionally’, means a woman (of the husband, who has a single son) is\nmore subordinated, subordinating.\n1970 1980 1990 2000\nAge (years) 17.5 12.9 15.0 11.8 (5.4) 6.6 (4.4) 6.6 (4.5) 8.2 (5.5)\n22.5 10.2 16.7 9.5 (4.9) 7.1 (4.8) 7.8 (5.5) 7.9 (5.4)\n32.5 6.8 (7.0) 7.1 (6.9) 6.8 (7.8) 6.9 (7.2)\n37.5 5.3 (5.9) 4.8 (6.0) 4.6 (6.9) 5.6 (5.8)\nShe does not compromise and exercises her agency as far as she is able. Her choice to now not have children is partly dependent on having fulfilled other priorities like tertiary education (higher than her mother ever experienced) and the discovery and development of a fulfilling job and career outside the home. But it is an environment in which she bears a greater burden of guilt and of role conflict.\nWe don't need children. 내 나이에는 몸이 고칠수가 있는데\n나는 이제 내자신의 인생을 살면서 미국에서 학생으로서 성공하고 싶어서 애기\n낳는 것은 … 아직! …현재 내 힘으로 차차 나가고자해요. 결혼에 대해서 늘 열등\n감이 있었어요, 있는건 사실이지만, 전통을 다 끊어 주고 이런 상황도 받아드려주\n는 것이 제 보람있는 인생이네요. Sometimes it was hard[is she refers to her parents?].\nBut, it was then. Korean women have their challenges too – a Korean soc ety's\ntraditional ways for women have been very demanding. Having children as a\nfunction for Korea society is for me! Impossible—Fun now if not very much. 지금은\n과거와 달라지기도해요. 좀 쉬우면서 이탈하기어려운 한국 전통 같은 한국적\n이에 대한 이야기를 했죠!\nIn an uncertain socio-economic setting—one still predominantly patriarchal— Korean women may compromise and choose to remain childfree for some time to enhance their career status. Later in their lives, they may face criticism and misunderstanding because they did not fulfil familial obligations and biological demands to become a custos. These narratives are drawn from, but modify and extend existing literature: instead of following a path of individuation—of finding a new path and creating social norms that allow them to achieve equality along with motherhood.\nContemporary research conducted indicates that an increasing proportion of job-oriented Korean women considers delaying childbirth while pursuing a career. They may marry later in life than would have occurred in previous generations, or primarily for extending their families’networks rather than to begin or continue a family of their own.\nIn their description of life in Korea, women respondents often articulated their childhood aspirations for higher education as a way of achieving equality or independence. They relished lifestyle choices available to them by virtue of living overseas, notably careers and the absence of resident in-laws and other burdens created and perpetuated through unspoken cultural rules. While they might have felt a sense of guilt at not fulfilling familial (cultural) expectations, strategies such as living and working overseas were methods of coping while allowing them to pursue advancement in their careers. Korean women placed maternity or a more comprehensive exploration of female and gender identity as a background or secondary issue to the ‘main events’ of developing autonomy and control over their own lives—and thereby avoiding subordination, even through marriage, to their husband’s family. In sum, and in relation to the literature on reflexivity, women’s attitudes might remain something to which I have devoted myself in a fulfilling life— and when children don’t arrive? Well, these things happen. Parents can become modernised—life has changed a lot—and people and family are confused about it all.\nNonetheless, to overemphasise the significance of changes to the employment domain in the Korean culture relative to the inalienable power of parent-child (jeong) and family-confined values, may risk missing essential points from informants’lived experiences. Accordingly, expressed below in some narratives, kinship relationships assume particular importance for married Korean women with regard to their childlessness. The emotional bonds of the family arrangements was merely a repeat of an earlier dynamic, prevalent for their mothers, can be explored through reference to individual narratives:\nMotherhood as Job --\nYun’s story clearly addresses the expectations shaped by traditional context and the broader emergence or acceptance of a work ethic. Women studied usually viewed themselves as ‘career-orientated’:\nBoth of my parents discipled us strictly, and hard-working people who did not rely\non traditional childbearing methods, nor family support, as many others did. There\nwas not many compromises for non-son preferences because a boy was a blessing,\nsaving all the related relatives...I know that I am not giving them any time like they\nwould wish, but now staying with my in-laws is impossible I think..I have a bit of freedom and my in-laws know that\nbut like most older people… there is a veil of silence around my not having a baby. 어머니 아버지 모두 유교적인\n기대는 있었던거 같아요. 장남의 아내로 우리 시부모님 제 걱정을 많이하는 것도 사실\n인데 남편은 뭔가 저에게 애기를 가지고 하는 정말 지겹죠\nHusbands were generally not referred to as people who had undermined their capacity to choose, but mothers’and in-laws’control was called into question, consistent with what Giddens’s model of various dimensions of conflict around ‘rights’analysed earlier.\nAs he observed, and borne out here, the Korean women felt disempowered by family members. In the tension of being educated to ‘exercise choices’, they failed to produce children and believed ‘the others’felt disappointed in them—irrespective of the internal rationalisations and/or external structural barriers, the perception of others’ expectations\nand their felt experiences of guilt, were strong reminders of their lack of power: Yet, as the next narrative suggests wide-spread diffusion of Western ideas that may be conducive to gender equity and the post-modern woman, much research alleges there may be widespread origins, but the diffusion is not necessarily homogenous and that different nations will experience a different form of individualisation, such as parenthood; varying value structures and meaning making will reflect in patterns of action. In this particularly contextualised perspective as borrowed from Korean culture, newly emerging value structure cannot escape nor transfer significantly until the reminants of colonial history are conquered. “For far-reaching transformative change to be institutionalized76, the new institutions of the state should be established that directly weaken the two pillars of familial gender inequality in the society: the control of women’and men’s separation between work and home,”states Nam70\nThis understanding is valuable in helping to shed more light on the contexts within which these",
