  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output \"The researcher spent ten years gathering important discoveries.\" does not show signs of explicit violation of the guidelines. However, without the original sentence to compare against, it is challenging to conclusively determine whether it has enhanced readability or sounds more conversational as instructed. The sentence appears straightforward but does not use particularly engaging or conversational language. Nevertheless, since assessment of these aspects requires knowing the input, compliance must be judged on what is observable. The given sentence is simple and factually direct, which could indicate some level of improved readability, albeit not enough information exists to fully evaluate this criterion.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
  "coverage": "ok"
