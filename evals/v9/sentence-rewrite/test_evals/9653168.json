  "rule": "The response must use language that is easy for a wide audience to relate to.",
  "input": "The procedure's complexity often deters individuals without specialized training from attempting it.",
  "validityText": "The input appears to be a single sentence, consistent with the requirement that it should not be an entire paragraph or multiple sentences. Additionally, the sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning, which implies it adheres to the need for logical structure and factual accuracy. The sentence isnâ€™t gibberish or nonsensical and doesn't lose its original meaning upon potential simplification. Furthermore, stylistic elements, while present, do not impact compliance as they can be changed in the rewriting process \n\nOK",
  "validity": "ok",
  "coverageText": "The procedure is pretty complicated, so most people who aren't specially trained tend to steer clear of trying it.",
  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output is conversational and enhances the readability by using simple, relatable language. Complex phrases have been simplified (\"The procedure is pretty complicated\" and \"people who aren't specially trained\") making it easy to understand, while preserving the original meaning. The structure is also engaging and fluid (\"tend to steer clear of trying it\"). There is no indication that the factual accuracy is compromised, but that aspect cannot be fully evaluated without the input. Overall, the output satisfies the requirement to improve sentence readability and conversational tone per the guidelines provided.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
