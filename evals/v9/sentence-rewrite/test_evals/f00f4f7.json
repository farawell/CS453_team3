  "validityText": "The input is a single sentence, adhering to the requirement that it should not be an entire paragraph or multiple sentences. Grammatically, the sentence is correct, with a subject (\"the audacious explorer\"), verbs (\"ventured\"), and an object (\"into uncharted territories\"). It contains complex phrases, such as \"Despite the formidable obstacles\" and \"ventured boldly,\" but these do not violate the requirement as the sentence still conveys a clear original meaning. Furthermore, the sentence is not gibberish or nonsensical; it is logically structured and factually plausible, given the context of exploration. There is no violation of the input specification.\n\nOK",
