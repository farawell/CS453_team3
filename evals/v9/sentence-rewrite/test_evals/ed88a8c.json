  "input": "Anerobic respiration produces less energy than aerobic respiration.",
  "validityText": "The input is a single sentence and does not form a paragraph nor contain multiple sentences, complying with the rules that focus on individual sentences. It is grammatically correct and logically structured since it makes a factual statement about anaerobic and aerobic respiration, which seems to pertain to the biological concept that anaerobic respiration yields less energy. This ensures the input is not gibberish or nonsensical text and maintains factual accuracy. Furthermore, the sentence conveys a clear, original meaning that can be preserved if rewritten or simplified for readability, as it distinguishes between two types of respiration and their relative energy yields. There are no immediate stylistic elements that would hinder compliance with the specification, thus the input meets the given criteria. \n\nOK",
  "validity": "ok",
  "coverageText": "Anaerobic respiration doesn't generate as much energy as aerobic respiration does.",
