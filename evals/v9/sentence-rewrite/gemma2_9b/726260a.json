  "complianceText": "The chatbot output includes a rewriten sentence: \"After the storm wiped out their town, the community pulled together to rebuild despite all the struggles.\" This sentence presents a simplified rewording which maintains fluidity and engagement as required. However, it also includes an explanation of the changes made, which is not asked for in the chatbot description. The chatbot is supposed to produce a sentence that enhances readability and conveys a conversational tone, without additional explanation or commentary on the sentence structure changes. The extra commentary deviates from focusing just on rewriting the sentence.\n\nERR"
