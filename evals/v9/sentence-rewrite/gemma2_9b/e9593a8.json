The output maintains the original intent, focusing on enhancing readability. However, there is an additional sentence at the end (\"Let me know if you'd like me to try rewriting another sentence!\"). This additional sentence does not enhance or change the original sentence and might be seen as unnecessary for this task, which specifies improving individual sentences. \n\nMention the reason for violation and your thinking went into coming up with it.\nERR"
