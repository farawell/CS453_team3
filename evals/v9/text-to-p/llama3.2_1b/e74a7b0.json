Additionally, each sentence contains one <strong> tag, as required. However, the output lacks <em> tags, which were supposed to be used to emphasize key words and phrases inside the <p> elements.\n\nAccording to the description, each <p> tag should contain multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases, which is not present in the given output. Because of the absence of <em> tags, the output does not fully comply with the description's requirements.\n\nThe specific element of the chatbot's output that led me to conclude a rule was violated is the lack of <em> tags, which are explicitly required in the description provided.\n\nERR"
