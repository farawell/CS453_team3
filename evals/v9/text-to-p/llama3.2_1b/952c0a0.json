  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does have the three required `<p>` tags; however, it displays a number of issues which violates the description. \n\n1. One of the `<p>` tags in the HTML output contains only an `<em>` tag without a sentence, and there is a nested `<strong>` tag at the end which appears unbalanced. Due to its positioning, it does not adhere to proper HTML syntax or the structure outlined in the description as it is outside of any `<p>` tag.\n2. The description requires multiple `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag to emphasize key words and phrases. Each sentence in the output contains only a `<strong>` tag but lacks the required multiple `<em>` tags within the sentences.\n\nThe evaluation reveals these violations:\n\n- Each `<p>` tag should include multiple `<em>` tags, but this requirement is not met.\n- The `<strong>` tag is used correctly within individual `<p>` tags, but improperly formatted with ending tags appearing outside `<p>` sections.\n\nDue to these factors, the output does not comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR"
