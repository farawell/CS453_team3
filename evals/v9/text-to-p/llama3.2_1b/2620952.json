The second <p> tag contains a <strong> tag for \"Birds\" and multiple <em> tags for \"sing\" and \"joyfully.\" The third <p> tag contains a single <em> tag for \"begins.\" The first <p> tag, however, does not contain a <strong> tag or an <em> tag inside it. Therefore, the output does not fully comply with the description because not all sentences have a <strong> or <em> tag as requested by the prompt.\n\nERR"
