Each of the first three `<p>` tags includes at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which complies with the requirement to emphasize key words or phrases inside each `<p>` tag. However, the fourth `<p>` tag does not contain any `<strong>` or `<em>` tags. The description specifically requires that each `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags. The absence of these tags in the fourth `<p>` tag constitutes a violation of the description guidelines. \n\nThe specific guideline violated is the requirement to have one `<strong>` and multiple `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag, which the fourth paragraph lacks.\n\nERR"
