Furthermore, at least three <p> tags should be present, and inside each <p> tag, there should be one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags for emphasis of key words and phrases.\n\nThe given output has several issues:\n\n1. Not all sentences are wrapped in <p> tags. Instead, some sentences are wrapped in <strong> tags directly, which is not in line with the instructions.\n2. The <strong> tags should be inside the <p> tags as per the instructions, but here they are separate from <p> tags.\n3. There appear to be stdem tags which are incorrect and not part of the HTML specification as described in the task.\n4. Multiple <em> tags are required inside each <p> tag for emphasizing key words, but there are no <em> tags used at all, only a misplaced <stdem> tag.\n\nDue to these discrepancies, the output does not align with the description provided.\n\nERR"
