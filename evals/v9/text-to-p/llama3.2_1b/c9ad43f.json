  "complianceText": "Upon examining the chatbot's output:\n\n1. The output does not comply with the requirement to split the paragraph into individual sentences, each wrapped with a `<p>` tag. The first sentence is correctly enclosed within a `<p>` tag. However, the second sentence has a missing opening `<p>` tag, resulting in an incomplete tag format (`</p**`). Additionally, the subsequent sentences appear to lack proper segmentation and tagging, leading to an unstructured and incorrect HTML format.\n\n2. The requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags is not met because there is only one complete `<p>` tag present in the output. Even if we consider the opened and mismatched tags, they do not reach the required number.\n\n3. Additionally, not all `<p>` tags contain both `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, which should be present to emphasize key words or phrases inside each sentence that is wrapped in a `<p>` tag.\n\nDue to these violations regarding the HTML formatting requirements specified, the output does not fully comply with the description.\n\nERR"
