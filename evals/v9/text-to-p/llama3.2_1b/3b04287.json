Then, inside each <p> tag, I have added one <strong> tag to emphasize key words \"Freedom\", \"creativity\" & liberty; multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words \"potential,&quot; innovation</em>.",

  "complianceText": "The output claims to format a paragraph into individual sentences, each wrapped with a `<p>` tag. It also states that a `<strong>` tag is added to emphasize certain key words, along with multiple `<em>` tags. However, upon examining the output:\n\n1. **Sentence Separation**: The output consists of nine `<p>` tags, but each seems to contain only one word. There is no clear indication that these are full sentences; they appear as individual words instead.\n\n2. **Use of `<strong>` and `<em>` Tags**: The output does not contain any `<strong>` or `<em>` tags within the `<p>` tags. This is a direct non-compliance with the description that each `<p>` tag should contain at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags.\n\n3. **Presence of At Least Three `<p>` Tags**: The description requires a minimum of three `<p>` tags, which the output does satisfy. However, these are individual words and not complete sentences.\n\nBased on these observations, the output does not comply with the description as it fails to include the required `<strong>` and `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag, and there is no evidence that full sentences have been wrapped in `<p>` tags.\n\nERR"
