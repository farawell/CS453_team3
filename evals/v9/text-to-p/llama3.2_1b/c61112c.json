  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description. According to the description, each sentence should be wrapped in a `<p>` tag, and inside each `<p>` tag, there should be one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. \n\n1. The first `<p>` tag is malformed and is not properly closed. It should have been `<p><strong><em>John has been working hard to complete his thesis.</em></strong></p>`, but instead, it appears as `<p Strong><Em>John has been working hard to complete his thesis.</Em></Strong>`. \n\n2. The second `<p>` tag only includes an `<em>` tag without a `<strong>` tag. It is written as `<p Em It is due next week.</p>`, which is also malformed and lacks a closing tag for `<em>`.\n\n3. The third `<p>` tag contains a `<strong>` tag but no `<em>` tags, written as `<p Strong He hopes to graduate with honors.</p>`, which again is malformed.\n\nTherefore, the output does not comply with the provided description due to improperly formatted tags and missing required `<strong>` and `<em>` tags in each sentence's `<p>` block.\n\nERR"
