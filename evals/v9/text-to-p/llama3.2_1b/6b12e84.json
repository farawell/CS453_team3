  "complianceText": "The output is evaluated based on the description. Firstly, the output should contain at least three sentences wrapped in individual <p> tags. The output appears to have issues with proper structuring as the opening and closing <p> tags are not correctly placed around sentences. \n\nAdditionally, the use of <strong> and <em> tags must occur within each <p> tag, but the output shows <strong> tags outside the initial <p> tag for the first sentence, and <em> tags randomly placed. The sentence about libraries is also not enclosed in <p> tags.\n\nHere's the detailed explanation of violations:\n1. The first <p> tag is closed before adding emphasis with <strong> tags, which should be inside the <p> tag.\n2. The sentence \"Reading can broaden our perspectives.\" seems to be split incorrectly within tags and lacks a proper <p> structure. \n3. The statement regarding libraries is not enclosed within <p> tags but is presented as plain text.\n4. Each sentence must be correctly encapsulated within <p> tags with proper use of <strong> and <em> tags inside those <p> tags.\n\nBased on these observations, although there are three sentences used, the formatting does not comply with the HTML structure requirement stipulated in the description.\n\nERR"
