Each <p> tag contains one <strong> tag, adhering to the instruction given. Additionally, there are multiple <em> tags included in the first two sentences but not in the third sentence. However, since the description doesn't specify the number of <em> tags required in each <p> tag, the presence of multiple <em> tags overall satisfies the guideline as far as sentence-level verification is concerned.\n\nThe chatbot output, therefore, complies with the description based solely on what can be evaluated from the provided output without the input context.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
