This directly violates the guideline of wrapping each sentence with a <p> tag and having at least three <p> tags.\n\n2. **<em> Tags Requirement**: Each <p> tag should contain multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases. The second <p> tag does not contain any <em> tags, which fails to comply with the description requirement of using multiple <em> tags.\n\nThese points clearly show that the chatbot's output does not fully align with the described formatting requirements.\n\nERR"
