  "complianceText": "The chatbot output has the following issues with compliance:\n\n1. The guideline specifies that each sentence within a `<p>` tag should have exactly one `<strong>` tag. In the output provided, only the first sentence has a `<strong>` tag, while the second and third sentences lack one. This violates the requirement that each sentence should have one `<strong>` tag.\n\n2. It is mentioned that multiple `<em>` tags should be used to emphasize key words and phrases, however, the actual HTML code provided does not contain any `<em>` tags. The description accompanying the output states that words like \"Tourist\" and \"History\" have been emphasized using `<em>` tags, but these are absent in the HTML structure shared.\n\nThe output, therefore, does not comply with the description because not every sentence is wrapped with a `<strong>` tag, and there are no `<em>` tags as expected.\n\nERR"
