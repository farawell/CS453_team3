Within each `<p>` tag, it includes one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags as required. This satisfies the rule of having at least three `<p>` tags, and each tag contains the necessary `<strong>` and `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. Thus, based on the description provided and without needing to know the specific input text, this output complies with the requirements given in the chatbot description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
