However, the formatting requires that *inside each <p> tag, there should be one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases*. In the provided HTML snippet, each sentence only contains one <em> tag, not multiple. This violates the requirement that there should be multiple <em> tags for each sentence.
