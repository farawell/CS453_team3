Each `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which aligns with the requirement to emphasize key words and phrases using these tags.\n\nNo part of the evaluation process requires knowing the input to determine compliance in this scenario. The output uses a uniform structure across all paragraphs, where each sentence appears formatted with the specified tags.\n\nGiven these observations, there are no violations concerning the chatbot's description requirements.\n\nOK"
