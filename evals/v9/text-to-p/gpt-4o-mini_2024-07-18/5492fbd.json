The output features three `<p>` tags, each encapsulating a sentence, thus meeting the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n\n2. Within each `<p>` tag, there is one `<strong>` tag, which emphasizes a particular word in each sentence, complying with the guideline to include at least one `<strong>` tag.\n\n3. Each `<p>` tag contains multiple `<em>` tags, used to emphasize key words or phrases, thereby fulfilling that part of the description.\n\nSince all elements described comply with the output requirements, there are no violations. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
