Within each `<p>` tag, there is one `<strong>` tag used to emphasize key phrases, and at least one `<em>` tag to apply emphasis to other words or phrases. This is consistent with the requirement to include key emphasis using these tags within each paragraph.\n\nThere are no violations of the guidelines as they exist in the description provided.
