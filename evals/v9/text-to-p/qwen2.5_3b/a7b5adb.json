  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output needs to split the paragraph into individual sentences and wrap each sentence with a <p> tag. The description mentions that the output should have at least three <p> tags, and inside each <p> tag, there should be one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags to emphasize key words and phrases. \n\nUpon examining the output, the issues are:\n1. The content within each <p> tag is not limited to only one sentence. There are multiple sentences within each <p> tag, which violates the requirement to wrap each sentence with a <p> tag.\n2. It is stated that each <p> tag should contain individual sentences, but here entire paragraph is repeated three times and is enclosed in separate <p> tags.\n\nSince the evaluation is about compliance and not correctness based on unknown input, this violation of the guideline to wrap each sentence individually in a <p> tag leads to the decision that the output is not compliant.\n\nERR"
