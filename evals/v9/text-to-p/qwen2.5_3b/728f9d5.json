According to the description, after splitting the paragraph into individual sentences, each sentence must be wrapped in its own <p> tag, resulting in at least three paragraph tags in the output. Additionally, the second and third sentences (\"I am planning to go for a walk.\" and \"Weather is perfect for outdoor activities.\") are within the same <p> tag, instead of being in separate <p> tags. Therefore, the output violates the descriptions guidelines as it fails to meet the requirement of having each sentence in a separate <p> tag.\n\nERR"
