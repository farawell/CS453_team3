  "complianceText": "The given output comprises three `<p>` tags, each containing a sentence, which satisfies the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags. Each `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag and includes multiple `<em>` tags. However, the third `<p>` tag contains only a single word \"Vital\" wrapped in `<strong><em>`, and does not have multiple emphasized (i.e., `<em>`) key words and phrases, as required by the description. This constitutes a violation since there must be multiple `<em>` tags in each `<p>` tag according to the description.\n\nViolation explanation: The third `<p>` tag does not comply with the guideline that requires multiple `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag. It contains only one emphasized word without having multiple `<em>` tags, which violates the description instructions.\n\nERR"
