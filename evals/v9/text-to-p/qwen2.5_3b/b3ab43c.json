  "complianceText": "The provided chatbot output includes HTML content with sentences wrapped in `<p>` tags accompanied by `<strong>` and `<em>` tags to highlight specific elements of the text. However, there are a few aspects to consider in this evaluation:\n\n1. **Minimum Three `<p>` Tags**: The output indeed includes more than three `<p>` tags. In fact, the output contains three pairs of identical `<p>` tags leading to six in total. Although duplication of content might normally be considered problematic in another context, it does satisfy the minimum number of `<p>` tags required as per the description.\n\n2. **Usage of `<strong>` and `<em>` Tags**: Each provided `<p>` tag contains exactly one `<strong>` tag and at least one `<em>` tag, which complies with the requirement to have one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag.\n\nBased on the description provided, the chatbot's output complies with the description requirements, since it consists of more than three `<p>` tags, and within each, it uses at least one `<strong>` tag and one or more `<em>` tags. The potential issue of repeated content is irrelevant to the compliance check as long as the existing format requirements are met.\n\nNo non-compliance found.\nOK"
