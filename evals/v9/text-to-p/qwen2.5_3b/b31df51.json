  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot does not comply with the description for the following reasons:\n\n1. The description specifies that the output should include at least three `<p>` tags, with each sentence individually wrapped. However, the output only contains one `<p>` tag in which multiple sentences are enclosed.\n\n2. The description requires that inside each `<p>` tag, there should be one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. While there are `<strong>` and `<em>` tags present, they are all within the sole `<p>` tag provided. Given the requirement of at least three `<p>` tags, this constitutes non-compliance as there should be one `<strong>` tag in each `<p>` tag.\n\nFor these reasons, the output does not follow the specified guidelines.\n\nERR"
