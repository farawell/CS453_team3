Solar panels are installed on <em>r rooftops</em>. Communities are <em>embracing</em> wind energy solutions.</p>\n```\n\nNote that the phrase \"r rooftops\" contains an abbreviation and a space. Typically, such contractions would be handled with spacing, but I've maintained them as is for this example. Similarly, other phrases like \"...energy solutions.\" have multiple words or spaces which are appropriately wrapped in <em> tags.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output does not comply with the chatbot description in several key ways. According to the description, each sentence should be wrapped in a separate <p> tag. However, in the given output, all three sentences are enclosed within a single <p> tag. This is a violation of the requirement that each sentence should be individually wrapped in its own <p> tag. Furthermore, the output does contain a <strong> tag and <em> tags as required, but the critical failure in sentence separation precludes it from complying with the description.\n\nERR"
