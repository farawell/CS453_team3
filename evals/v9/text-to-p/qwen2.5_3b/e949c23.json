Furthermore, the output should include one `<strong>` tag within each `<p>` tag, but the first `<p>` tag contains a `<strong>` tag that seems to function as a label rather than emphasizing a word or phrase. Therefore, the output does not comply with the description because of the insufficient number of `<p>` tags and the incorrect usage of `<strong>` tags relative to the requirements.\n\nERR"
