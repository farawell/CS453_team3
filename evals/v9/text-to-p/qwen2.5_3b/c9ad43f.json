Additionally, while there is use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags within the provided `<p>` tags, the fact that only one set of `<p>` tags was provided clearly violates the description which mandates that there must be at least three `<p>` tags. The note acknowledges a mistake, but explanation or intention cannot replace actual output requirements.\n\nERR"
