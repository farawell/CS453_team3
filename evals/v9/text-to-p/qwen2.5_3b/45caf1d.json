  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains three sentences, each wrapped in a `<p>` tag as required by the description. Each `<p>` tag appropriately includes a `<strong>` tag to emphasize a word, and multiple `<em>` tags are used in the first two paragraphs to emphasize key words and phrases. The third `<p>` tag, however, does not include an `<em>` tag for additional emphasis on key words or phrases, which is a non-compliance with the description guideline of including multiple `<em>` tags in each `<p>` tag.\n\nThe reasoning for the decision:\n- The description clearly states to add multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag. While the first two paragraphs comply with this, the third paragraph lacks an `<em>` tag, thus violating the requirement stated in the description.\n\nERR"
