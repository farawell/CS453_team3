Each `<p>` tag should contain at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. Based on the output provided:\n\n1. There are three `<p>` tags present in the output, which satisfies the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n2. Each `<p>` tag contains at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags. This is evident as:\n   - The first `<p>` tag has one `<strong>` tag and five `<em>` tags.\n   - The second `<p>` tag has three `<strong>` tags and seven `<em>` tags.\n   - The third `<p>` tag has two `<strong>` tags and eight `<em>` tags.\n3. The output seems to be formatted in HTML as per the requirement.\n\nThe output complies with the description requirements, which can be checked without knowing the input. Thus, no violations are found regarding the parts of the requirement that don't depend on the input.\n\nOK"
