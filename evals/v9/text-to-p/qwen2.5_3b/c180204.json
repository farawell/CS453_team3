Within each <p> tag, there is a use of a <strong> tag to emphasize key words and phrases along with multiple <em> tags, this is visible in each of the sentences provided in the given output. \n\n- In the first paragraph, the words \"Hope\" and \"hopeful\" are both wrapped in <strong> and <em> tags, and \"belongs\" is wrapped in an <em> tag.\n- In the second paragraph, the words \"Faith\" and \"future\" are both wrapped in <strong> and <em> tags, and \"secures\" is wrapped in an <em> tag.\n- In the third paragraph, the word \"Love\" is wrapped in both <strong> and <em> tags, and \"conquers\" is wrapped in an <em> tag.\n\nThe requirements set by the description are therefore met in terms of structure, as each p tag contains at least one strong tag and multiple em tags.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
