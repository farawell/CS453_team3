However, each `<p>` tag is required to have one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases. The provided output uses multiple `<strong>` tags and does not contain any `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag, which violates the description requirement of having both `<strong>` and `<em>` tags.\n\nSince there is a deviation from the description due to the absence of `<em>` tags and incorrect usage of multiple `<strong>` tags instead of a single one in each `<p>`, this leads to non-compliance with the given description.\n\nERR"
