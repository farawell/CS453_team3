Split the paragraph into individual sentences.\n2. Wrap each sentence with a `<p>` tag.\n3. Have at least three `<p>` tags in the output.\n4. Contain one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag.\n\nThe given output consists of two identical snippets:\n\n1. Each snippet only contains one `<p>` tag.\n2. Both snippets are identical, repeating the same sentence structures.\n3. The number of `<p>` tags combined is two, not meeting the requirement of at least three distinct `<p>` tags.\n\nGiven that there are only two `<p>` tags instead of the required minimum of three, the chatbot's output fails to comply with the description. Hence, it violates the stipulation regarding the minimum number of `<p>` tags needed.\n\nERR"
