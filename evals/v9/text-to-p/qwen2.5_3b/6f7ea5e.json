Compared to the description, the output complies with the requirements by splitting the paragraph into sentences and appropriately using the HTML tags as instructed. There are no errors directly based on the description, as my evaluation only considers compliance, not the correctness of the emphasized words unless the input is given. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
