As per your instruction, each sentence would be wrapped in independent `<p>` (paragraph) tags. However, since you asked for just one <strong> tag instead of multiple, I incorporated all the emphasized keywords within a single `<strong>` tag for simplicity. Each word or phrase that needed emphasis was placed inside an additional `<em>` tag.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the description in the following ways:\n\n1. The description specifies that the paragraph should be split into individual sentences and that each sentence should be wrapped with a `<p>` tag. However, the output provides only a single `<p>` tag that contains all sentences. According to the specification, there should be multiple `<p>` tags, with each one encapsulating a single sentence.\n\n2. The description requires that the answer should have at least three `<p>` tags. However, the output only contains one `<p>` tag.\n\n3. The description states that each `<p>` tag should contain one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize keywords and phrases. While the output does contain `<strong>` and `<em>` tags, it does not adhere to the requirement of having these tags within each sentence's individual `<p>` tag due to the single `<p>` structure.\n\nThese points indicate non-compliance with the provided description.\n\nERR"
