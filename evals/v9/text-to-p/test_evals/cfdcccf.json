  "coverageEvalText": "In evaluating the chatbot's output, I will closely examine the formatting of the HTML as described in the provided guidelines. \n\n1. The description specifies that the paragraph should be split into individual sentences, and each sentence should be wrapped in a `<p>` tag. The output includes three `<p>` tags, which is in compliance with the guideline that there should be at least three `<p>` tags.\n\n2. The next requirement is to add one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag. The output meets this requirement as every `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag, which emphasizes a single word or phrase. Additionally, each `<p>` tag contains multiple `<em>` tags, which are used to emphasize key words and phrases.\n\nTaking into account these elements, the chatbot's output is compliant with the description provided. There are no violations of the stated instructions, as the structure is consistent with the requirement to include at least three `<p>` tags, each containing the specified use of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags.\n\nOK",
