In the first sentence, \"never\" is wrapped in a `<strong>` tag. In the second sentence, \"Growth\" is inside a `<strong>` tag. In the third sentence, \"power\" is wrapped in a `<strong>` tag.\n\n- **Use of <em> Tags**: The output also features `<em>` tags highlighting keywords and phrases. The word \"Learning\" in the first sentence, \"continuous\" in the second sentence, and \"Knowledge\" in the third sentence are all emphasized with `<em>` tags.
