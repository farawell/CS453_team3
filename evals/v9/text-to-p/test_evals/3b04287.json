  "coverageEvalText": "The output consists of three HTML paragraphs, each with a `<p>` tag containing one `<strong>` tag and one `<em>` tag. The description requires that there be at least three `<p>` tags, which is fulfilled as there are exactly three paragraphs. Each paragraph must have one `<strong>` tag, which is satisfied as each paragraph has exactly one `<strong>` tag. The description also mentions \"multiple <em> tags,\" but each paragraph here has only one `<em>` tag, which does not meet the requirement for multiple `<em>` tags. \n\nThe violation of the rule specifying multiple `<em>` tags is clear: the text within each `<p>` tag contains only one `<em>` tag, contradicting the requirement for multiple tags. This discrepancy does not comply with the chatbot description.\n\nERR",
