  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output adheres to the guidelines set forth in the description. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. The paragraph has been split into individual sentences, each wrapped in a `<p>` tag. There are three such `<p>` tags present in the output, thereby satisfying the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n\n2. Each `<p>` tag contains a `<strong>` tag emphasizing a key word or phrase, as specified. For example, the words \"window,\" \"Imagination,\" and \"ambition\" are wrapped with `<strong>` tags.\n\n3. Multiple `<em>` tags have been used inside each `<p>` tag to emphasize key words and phrases further. These are applied to words such as \"world,\" \"limitless,\" \"explore,\" \"possibilities,\" \"fuel,\" and \"achieve,\" meeting the criterion of including multiple `<em>` tags.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the output is compliant with the chatbot description provided.\n\nOK",
