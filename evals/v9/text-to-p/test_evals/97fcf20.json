  "validityText": "The input is a paragraph of text consisting of three separate sentences: \"Integrity earns respect.\" \"Honesty builds trust.\" \"Transparency is vital.\" Each sentence is clear and distinct. The input also includes a combination of letters and punctuation marks (periods). There are no excessive whitespace characters or any sentence solely based on them. Thus, the input complies with the requirement of containing at least three separate sentences and not consisting solely of whitespace characters.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output consists of three paragraphs, each wrapped in a <p> tag, which meets the requirement of having at least three <p> tags. Within each paragraph, there is a <strong> tag used, and multiple <em> tags are present to emphasize certain words or phrases. There are no explicit rules regarding the number of <em> tags, only that there should be multiple, which is satisfied in the first two paragraphs. The third paragraph only has one <em> tag, which doesn't fulfill the \"multiple\" requirement of two or more <em> tags. This constitutes a violation of the provided description where all <p> tags should have both one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags.\n\nBased on this reasoning, there is a violation due to the third paragraph not containing multiple <em> tags, which leads to non-compliance with the chatbot description.\n\nERR",
