In life, the decisions you <em>make today</em>, shape your <em>future</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Actions</strong> speak louder. What you <em>do</em> consistently speaks volumes about your <em>character</em> and <em>integrity</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Words</strong> have power.

  "coverageEvalText": "The output complies with the description in the following ways:\n1. The paragraph is broken into three distinct sentences, each wrapped with `<p>` tags.\n2. Each `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag, which is used to emphasize a key word or phrase within each sentence.\n3. Multiple `<em>` tags are used in each sentence to emphasize additional key words and phrases.\n\nSince all aspects required by the description are met—specifically, having at least three `<p>` tags with appropriate usage of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags—I conclude that the output complies with the description.\n\nOK",
