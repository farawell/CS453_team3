The input contains a series of characters forming sentences, which include letters, punctuation, and the necessary elements to be considered as sentences.\n3. The text includes the following three sentences:\n   - \"Perseverance defines character.\"\n   - \"Strength is revealed in adversity.\"\n   - \"Resilience shines.\"\n\nEach sentence ends with a period, indicating sentence termination, and they are composed of coherent words to form a complete thought or assertion. This fulfills the requirement for having at least three separate sentences. The sentences are correctly constructed using a combination of letters and punctuation.\n\nBased on these evaluations, the input meets all the requirements of the input specification without any violations.\n\nOK",

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output is formatted with multiple sentences wrapped in individual `<p>` tags, with embedded `<strong>` and `<em>` tags for emphasis, as per the description. Specifically, each paragraph contains one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags applied to various key words and phrases within each `<p>` tag.\n\nThe output contains at least three `<p>` tags, each encapsulating different sentences:\n1. First paragraph contains \"Perseverance\" in a `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags like \"character,\" \"determination,\" and \"steadfastness.\"\n2. Second paragraph emphasizes \"Strength\" in a `<strong>` tag and uses `<em>` tags around \"adversity,\" \"capabilities,\" and \"tenacity.\"\n3. Third paragraph highlights \"resilience\" with a `<strong>` tag and includes `<em>` tagged words such as \"struggle,\" \"ability,\" and \"undaunted.\"\n\nThis corresponds to the chatbot's description requirements: tagging sentences with HTML `<p>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>` as instructed. \n\nThus, based solely on the output and the guidelines provided, there is no violation of the described format rules in the chatbot description. All aspects align correctly with the description's requirements.\n\nOK",
