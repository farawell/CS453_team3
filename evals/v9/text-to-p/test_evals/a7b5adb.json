The input text must contain at least three separate sentences: The input contains three sentences: \"History teaches us valuable lessons.\", \"The present is a gift.\", and \"Future is unknown.\" Each sentence is clearly demarcated by a period, fulfilling this requirement.\n\n3. The input can include any combination of letters, numbers, symbols, and punctuation: The input uses letters and punctuation, complying with this rule.\n\n4.

  "coverageEvalText": "The output provided must be evaluated based on the description:\n\n1. The output contains three separate `<p>` tags, which complies with the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags. \n\n2. Each `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag, which is in compliance with the requirements.\n\n3. Each `<p>` tag includes multiple `<em>` tags; however, the second and third `<p>` tags each contain only one `<em>` tag. The description specifies multiple `<em>` tags, which implies two or more for each sentence, so these sentences do not comply fully with the description.\n\nTherefore, even though the first condition is met (at least three `<p>` tags), the last requirement of multiple `<em>` tags per `<p>` is not fully complied within the second and third paragraphs. \n\nThinking process: \n- I first verified the number of `<p>` tags to ensure there are at least three. \n- I then checked each paragraph to verify if there was one `<strong>` tag, which is a valid compliance.\n- The last step was to check for multiple `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag. The presence of one `<em>` tag for two of the paragraphs means it does not meet the requirement of multiple `<em>` tags.\n\nERR",
