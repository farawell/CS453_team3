  "complianceText": "The output starts with explaining that HTML code is provided with emphasized terms. The provided HTML code contains 3 sentences: \n\n1. `<p><strong>Cooking</strong> is an <em>essential</em> skill for <em>self-sufficiency</em>.</p>`\n2. `<p>It allows you to control exactly what you eat and how it's <strong>prepared</strong>.</p>`\n3. `<p>There are <em>countless</em> recipes available to help you learn and discover <em>new dishes</em>.</p>`\n\nEach sentence is wrapped in a `<p>` tag, which complies with the instruction to wrap each sentence with a `<p>` tag. There is a total of three `<p>` tags, satisfying the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags.\n\nFurthermore, inside each `<p>` tag, there is the use of one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags. \n\n- In the first `<p>` tag: `<strong>` is used for \"Cooking\" and `<em>` is used for \"essential\" and \"self-sufficiency\".\n- In the second `<p>` tag: `<strong>` is used for \"prepared\" with no `<em>` tags, which violates the requirement for multiple `<em>` tags.\n- In the third `<p>` tag: `<strong>` tag is absent, violating the requirement to add one `<strong>` tag.\n\nHence, there are multiple compliance issues based on the presence and distribution of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags as specified in the description.\n\nOverall, the explanation in the chatbot's output about emphasizing different words seems unrelated to compliance check but is an extra offering to the user, hence can be ignored for this compliance check.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I conclude:\nERR"
