  "complianceText": "The output includes three sentences each wrapped in a `<p>` tag, which complies with the requirement of having at least three `<p>` tags. In each `<p>` tag, there is one `<strong>` tag present, which satisfies the requirement of having one `<strong>` tag inside each `<p>` tag. Additionally, there are also `<em>` tags used in the output, satisfying the requirement to have multiple `<em>` tags. However, it is worth noting that in the third `<p>` tag, there is a word marked with an asterisk `*binds*` instead of using `<em>` tags which is non-compliant as per the description of using HTML tags specifically. Overall, the output doesn't fully comply due to this use of asterisks instead of `<em>` tags.\n\nERR"
