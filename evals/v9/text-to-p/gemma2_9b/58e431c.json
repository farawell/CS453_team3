  "complianceText": "The evaluation is based on the compliance of the chatbot's output with the provided description. According to the description, the chatbot should perform the following tasks:\n\n1. **Split the paragraph into individual sentences and wrap each sentence with a \"<p>\" tag**: \n   - The output contains three \"<p>\" tags, which satisfy the requirement of having at least three separate sections for sentences.\n\n2. **Add one \"<strong>\" tag inside each \"<p>\" tag**:\n   - The output correctly contains one \"<strong>\" tag inside each \"<p>\" tag.\n\n3. **Add multiple \"<em>\" tags to emphasize keywords and phrases inside each \"<p>\" tag**:\n   - The first \"<p>\" contains one \"<em>\" tag.\n   - The second \"<p>\" contains one \"<em>\" tag.\n   - The third \"<p>\" incorrectly uses \"**success**\" instead of wrapping 'success' with an \"<em>\" tag as required.\n\nThe description specifies that multiple \"<em>\" tags should be used inside each \"<p>\" tag. The use of \"**\" syntax for 'success' in the third \"<p>\" is not compliant because it does not use an \"<em>\" tag for emphasizing keywords as required by the description. This results in non-compliance with the specified requirements for HTML formatting.\n\nConsidering the reasoning above, there's one compliance issue: the improper use of emphasis in the third \"<p>\" tag. \n\nERR"
