Within each `<p>` tag, there is one `<strong>` tag and one `<em>` tag. The description requires at least one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags within each `<p>` tag to emphasize key words and phrases.\n\nThe violation here is that each `<p>` tag only contains one `<em>` tag, while the description specifies that there should be multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases.
