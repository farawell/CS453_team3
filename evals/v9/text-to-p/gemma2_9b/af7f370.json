  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the description for the following reasons:\n\n1. The description specifies that formatting should be done with a combination of `<strong>` tags and `<em>` tags. The output incorrectly uses underscores (_) and asterisks (**) around words, which are not valid HTML tags for emphasis.\n\n2. The description explicitly requires the use of one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags inside each `<p>` tag. Upon inspection:\n   - The first paragraph has only one `<em>` tag (around \"quick\") and does not comply with the requirement of using multiple `<em>` tags.\n   - The second and third paragraphs have neither `<strong>` nor `<em>` tags, failing to comply with the requirement.\n   - The use of both `<strong>` and `<em>` tags is incomplete in all `<p>` tags, violating the requirement to have both types of tags in each sentence.\n\n3. The description requires that the formatted output contains at least three `<p>` tags. The output does comply with this aspect since there are three `<p>` tags.\n\nOverall, despite having three `<p>` tags, the improper use of emphasis tags results in a non-compliance with the description. \n\nERR"
