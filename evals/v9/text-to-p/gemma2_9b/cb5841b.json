  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot contains three <p> tags, as per the requirement of the description, which specifies that there should be at least three <p> tags. Each of these <p> tags contains at least one <strong> tag and multiple <em> tags, fulfilling the requirement to emphasize key words and phrases inside each paragraph. The execution of splitting text into sentences and wrapping them in <p> tags, as well as the use of <strong> and <em> tags, appears to align with the given description without needing to evaluate correct splitting of the text into sentences or correct highlighting of key words, which is not possible without input.\n\nTherefore, there are no violations in terms of format as per the description guidelines. My conclusion, based solely on compliance with the description given, is that the output complies with the chatbot's requirements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
