  "complianceText": "The provided chatbot output contains HTML with sentences wrapped in <p> tags, which aligns with the requirement to have at least three <p> tags. Within these tags, a <strong> tag is present, but it is not used consistently or correctly within the HTML structure itself, as there is an inconsistency in the use of format (such as ** and _ for emphasis) rather than HTML <em> tags specifically for key phrases. The use of ** and _ is not valid HTML and does not comply with the guideline to use <em> tags for multiple emphasized words/phrases within each <p>. The use of different emphasis symbols instead of sticking with HTML tags violates the requirement for specific HTML formatting.\n\nViolation: The output does not use <em> tags for emphasizing key words/phrases in each <p> tag as explicitly required in the description. There is a prohibitive use of non-HTML elements, thus violating proper HTML formatting rules specified.\n\nERR"
