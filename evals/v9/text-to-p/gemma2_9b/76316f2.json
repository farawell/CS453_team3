Within the first `<p>` tag, there is one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags, which complies with the instructions.\n   \n3. The second `<p>` tag contains one `<strong>` tag and one `<em>` tag, meeting the specified requirements.\n   \n4. The third `<p>` tag contains only `<em>` tags and no `<strong>` tag, which violates the requirement that each `<p>` tag should contain at least one `<strong>` tag.\n\nDue to the absence of a `<strong>` tag in the third `<p>` tag, the output does not fully comply with the description, which clearly states that each `<p>` tag must have one `<strong>` tag along with multiple `<em>` tags for emphasizing keywords and phrases.
