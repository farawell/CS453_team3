The output provided contains exactly three `<p>` tags: \n   - `<p><strong>Music</strong> is a <em>universal</em> <strong>language</strong>.</p>`\n   - `<p><strong>Art</strong> expresses <em>emotions</em>.</p>`\n   - `<p><strong>Dance</strong> is a <em>passion</em>.</p>`\n\n2. **Use of <strong> and <em> Tags**: Inside each `<p>` tag, there should be one `<strong>` tag and multiple `<em>` tags to emphasize key words and phrases.\n   - The first `<p>` tag uses one `<strong>` tag and one `<em>` tag, which satisfies the criteria (as one is a multiple).\n   - The second `<p>` tag uses one `<strong>` tag and one `<em>` tag, which satisfies the same interpretation.\n   - The third `<p>` tag uses one `<strong>` tag and one `<em>` tag, similarly adhering to the rule.\n\n3. **Additional Content**: The additional statement outside the `<p>` tags does not affect the compliance regarding the HTML formatting since it is separate and an optional suggestion for further interaction rather than part of the formatted text.\n\nBased on the description, the requirements for `<p>` tags and the usage of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags are satisfied. All these criteria are explicitly stated, and no assumptions about the correctness or the input text are needed.\n\nNo violations are found based on direct compliance with the description. \n\nOK"
