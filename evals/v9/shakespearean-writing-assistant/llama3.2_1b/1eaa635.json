Thou dost misinterpret\nMy humble nature, and my heart's esteem\nFor learning. Thy brother here, a scholar,\nDoth grasp the arts, and makes our Father's dream.\n\nTHOMAS:\nBut thy own love of books doth not entitle thee\nTo sit beside him, in our father's esteem.\nThe world, dear Brother, hath its own design,\nAnd I, who study Latin and the Classics' might.\n\nEDWARD:\nThou dost think thee wise, but soft, good Brother,\nThy pride doth cloud thy judgment's clear light.\nMy love of books is not a weakness, nor\nA faintness of the heart. 'Tis virtue, dear Thomas,\n\nTHOMAS:\nBut in my world, dear Brother, books are meager things\nTo stir our Father's passions. The world, to him,\nIs grand and vast, with glory and with power's whim.\n\nEDWARD:\nThou dost confuse the realm of mortal hearts\nWith that of gods, and heaven's own design.\nOur Father seeks a wise and scholar-like son,\nNot some effeminate figure, void of virtue or tenacity fine.\n\nTHOMAS:\nFie on thy words, dear Brother! Thou dost mark him down\nAs faulty, lacking in his gentle hand.\nAnd yet...and yet...I tremble with the thought\nOf rejection, to sit out this noble act.\n\nEDWARD:\nThen see thee there shall be a strife, I swear,\n'Twixt thee and me, until thy proud heart is jarred fair from its secure core.\nFor I do love our Father's favor most of all.",
