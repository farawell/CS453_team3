The Parents have just returned from a long absence. Two younger Siblings, ELLEN and EDWARD, stand upon opposite sides of the Table, their Faces etched with Determination.)\n\nEllen: \"O, gracious Father! I do beseech thee, see once more how worthy am I to hold thy favor!\n\nEdward: \"Fie on't, dear sister! Thou shalt not thus persist in asking for my consent.\nI have, this day, received many presents from fairer girls, and can they compare\nTo thee? Thou art the fairest child of mine eyes!\"\n\nEllen: \"Alas, most unkindly words speak thou to me!\nCan any thing be more hateful than that I should not see\nThy smiling face, and feel thy loving hand entreat mine?\nPrithee, dear Father, have not those deeds been good enough for thee?\n\nEdward: \"Good sir! Do you know what I say? I call no father's praise false,\nIf from my words alone they cannot be won; but by my deeds to prove it.\nForsooth, thy charity is more than any man can hold.\n\nEllen: \"A pox upon thy virtue, Edward dear!\nI shall not hear one word from thee that thou dost say in scorn.\nWhat need have we of thy false flattery, which doth but serve\n\nTo stir up tempers and make bitter disputes,\nWhile calmness and fair words have been our best aid?\n\nEdward: \"Enough! Thou shalt behold the fate that will befall thee thus,\nFor I shall never be deceived by falsehood; nor can trust\nThy kindness and your love, now that they do lack:\nI'll have my own way of making thee see thy error!\"\n\n(The quarrel escalates until both Siblings shout and storm away in anger.)",
