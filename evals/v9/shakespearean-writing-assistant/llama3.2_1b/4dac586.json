  "output": "O, wouldst thou know the secrets of my troubled mind,\nHow oft I struggle with the forced design?\nLife doth defy the conventions of our art,\nAnd in its twistlessness, I am lost from start.\n\nNo linear tale, with heroes bold and bright,\nTo captivate the audience, or so 'tis told.\nA dance of choices, with each step unsure,\nLeaves me to ponder, whether I did strive.\n\nAmidst this labyrinthine existence, I roam,\nSeeking the narrative fire that doth make me home.\nBut like a will-o'-the-wisp, it fades away,\nLeaving me with naught but the dull grey of day.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output utilizes a Shakespearean style with elements such as the use of \"thou,\" \"doth,\" and a poetic form. The language is ornate and structured with a rhythm reminiscent of Shakespeareâ€™s work. It reflects Shakespearean themes, discussing fate, uncertainty, and the existential quest. The use of metaphor and classical language contributes to its compliance with the Shakespearean style. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
