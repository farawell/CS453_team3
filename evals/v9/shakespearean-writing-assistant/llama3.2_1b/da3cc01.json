Thou dost beg for a tale,\nA fleeting glimpse into the depths of our zeal\nFor mystery and intrigue, where truth doth play\nA subtle part, as veils are drawn to gray.\n\nIn this enchanted realm, we wander free,\nThrough gardens blooming with words, yet to be\nAppointed forth by fate, our fates do bind\nWith threads of meaning, that in whispers wind.\n\nOur hearts, aflutter like birds set free,\nDance on a wind that whispers secrets to thee,\nThat thou, dear Requester, wast not aware,\nOf the whispered promises we've made with care.\n\nSo I, a traveler in this world of dreams,\nSay thou hast wandered into a realm serene,\nWhere shadows play and meaning doth roam\nFree as a sprite that flits and flees his home.\n\nTherefore, I bid thee, dear Requester, farewell,\nMy story ends in this gentle, secret tale to dwell.\nMay Fortune smile upon thy journey's end.",
