  "output": "O, wouldst thou hear the tale of woe 'twixt mortal's might\nAnd Olympian power, in this most valiant fight?\n'Twas said 'twas Anzel, a hero bold and bright,\nWhose heart was keen with courage, and his soul alight.\n\nGods themselves did swear to challenge Anzel's fame,\nTo test the mettle of the mortal's name.\nAthena, Zeus' daughter, brought forth valor in array,\nTo slay the foe, whose legend would forever sway.\n\nThe battle raged 'neath Olympus' fiery skies,\nAs thunderbolts and shafts of divine fire drew nigh.\nAnzel stood tall, though fear did tremble within his breast,\nAnd with each blow, his armor shook and let its guard rest.\n\nBut gods are gods, and mortal's might is hard to break,\nYet still Anzel fought, his spirits unbroken and awake.\nHe struck the blow of Argos, son of Zeus' pride,\nThat laid him low, yet raised but his spirit inside.\n\nNow gods did snicker, jeer at mortal's might so bold,\nBut Anzel would not yield, for honor to unfold.\nAthena brought forth her sacred owl, a symbol true,\nOf wisdom and insight, to guide the mortal anew.\n\nThus Anzel proved, 'tis not the mighty who best\nIn valiant combat; but those who seek to do their best.\nAnd so the crowd did cheer, though doubt did whisper low,\n\"How can a mortal win against the gods below?\"\n\nBut then came fate's decree: the contest's final test,\nWould prove Anzel's worth, as gods' true love he should find rest.",
