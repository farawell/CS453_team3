  "output": "O, fairest verse! thou dost beseech thy poet's aid,\nTo sing the tale of one who wanders in dismay,\nA minstrel lost, with heart and soul astray,\nIn pursuit of truth and beauty of the gray.\n\nHis name is Eryndor, a youth of noble birth,\nWhose fate, 'tis told, was woven from threads of mirth,\nHe danced and sang, his heart full of delight,\nAnd brought joy to all who heard his merry night.\n\nBut now, as he strays, his path doth wander wide,\nThrough hills and dells, where few may reside,\nHe trod with feet that bear the weight of his quest,\nTo seek the wisdom of the ages, long since passed.\n\nHis bow, a-swinging forth its sweetly-strung refrain,\nEchoes through forests dark, where ghosts of days past stain,\nHe searches for an answer to his heart's deep cry,\nAnd finds instead the songs of birds, that nature doth imply.\n\nThrough meadows green, he makest his weary way,\nWhere wildflowers bloom, like tears of sunny day,\nTheir colors dancing in the breeze with glee and smile,\nAs Eryndor wanders, lost, but not forlorn, all the while.\n\nYet, as night falls soft, with stars above,\nHe camps beneath a hill, where he doth love to swole,\nA kettle fires his humble meal of fare,\nAnd thus begins another day, in Eryndor's lair.\n\nO, gentle countryside! thy loveliness doth call\nTo those who wander, lost as I, beyond the wall,\nFor though I search for answers to my heart's deep pain,\nThy tranquil fields and trees, shall be mine own sweet gain.\n\nAnd thus, a minstrel wanders still, in pursuit of his rhyme,\nThrough beauty's realm, where wild and free, he doth entwine.",
