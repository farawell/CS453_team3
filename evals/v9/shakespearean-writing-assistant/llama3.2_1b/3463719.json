I am compelled to confesse thy presence in mine breast, though thou dost eschew me, as if my very thoughts were naught but a fleeting wisp of dust.\n\nMy heart, aflutter like the wings of a bird set loose from its cage, beats fast and fervently for thee alone. 'Tis as if I had grasped the very winds that blow across the sea, and felt thy balm-like sweetness carry me on its gentle tide.\n\nFie upon my longing! Doth thou not see that I am wounded by this cruel fate? Thy words, a whispered promise of sweet communion, doth only serve to deepen mine anguish. Ah, cruel fate, why dost thou deny me such an opportunity?\n\nYet, in my secret heart, a flame still burns brightly, a fire that will ne'er be quenched till thou dost return it to the warmth it once knew. Till then, 'twill remain a smoldering ember of most ardent love.\n\nThy faithful admirer,\nA captive of thy whispers",
