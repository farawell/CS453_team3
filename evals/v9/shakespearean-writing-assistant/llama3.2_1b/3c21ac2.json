There is a lack of Shakespearean words or phrasing such as \"thou\" or \"hath,\" and the use of modern language and imagery indicates a departure from the traditional Shakespearean style. The description requires the use of Shakespearean style writing, but the output does not incorporate any elements or stylistic choices characteristic of Shakespeare's works as highlighted in the description.\n\nERR"
