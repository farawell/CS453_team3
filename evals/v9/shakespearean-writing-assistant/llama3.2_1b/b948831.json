  "output": "Fair sir or madam, thou dost request\nA poetic tribute to celestial gifts,\n'Twixt starry skies and ocean's gentle sway,\n\nWhen stars, like diamonds in the velvet night,\nDo twinkle, sparkle, and with gentle light\n Illuminate the sky, as pure and fair,\nAs waves, that on the ocean's breast do bear.\n\nThy wavelets, soft and rolling to the shore,\nLike moonbeams, glowing, calm, and evermore;\nTheir gentle motion doth bespeak a peace,\nThat in the heart, when troubles cease.\n\nThe stars, like sentinels of time and fate,\nWatching over worlds with steadfast might;\nWhile ocean's tides, an ebb and flow, do make\nA symphony of depths, where secrets sleep.\n\nAnd thus, fair friend, we're bound to compare\nThese two divine gifts, in wonder's lair.\nFor though each may seem a separate thing,\nBoth share a beauty that our souls can cling.",
