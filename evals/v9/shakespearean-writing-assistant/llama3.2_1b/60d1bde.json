Who doth he be?\n\nTHRUSBAND:\n'Tis he, dear Mercutio. O, he that shall descend\nInto the depths of human error and woe,\nWith flaws that shall enthrall his heart, his mind,\nAnd in thine eyes, a tragic fate shall sow.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nFie on him! Shall I write of one such dire plight?\nNot though 'twere my own dear friend, nor fate's most just.\nBut shall it be some fool, or noble knight?\nOr shall it be that wretched youth who bore\nA fatal flaw, a curse that would not pass.\n\nTHRUSBAND:\nAh, Mercutio, hast thou heard the words of old?\nWhat fortunes I, in ancient days, didst see written\nIn scrolls of parchment, yellowed with time's decay.\nThey spoke of heroes doomed, by flaws, to fall,\nTheir names etched in the annals of forgotten pain.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nAnd what of love? Shall not the greatest of hearts\nBe torn asunder by a fatal flaw?\nShall not the passion of great love be his demise?\n\nTHRUSBAND:\nLove looks not with the eyes, but with the mind; and\nTherefore is winged Cupid painted blind.\n(Aside) For though Cupid may be hidden from our sight,\nHis gaze doth scan the depths of human hearts, and find\n\nThe fatal flaws that will end all mortal lives.\nO, Mercutio, listen well to this verse, for\nIt shall be thine own fate, if thou dost not heed.\n\n(Mercutio's eyes gleam with excitement as Thrusband hands him a scroll.)\n\nLet them begin!",
