  "output": "O, fairest woods, thy harmony doth reign\nA symphony of silence, whisper'd sweetest refrain\nThe leaves, a gentle lovers' sigh, in rustling breath\nDo dance to secret melodies, beneath thy shaded depth\n\nThe wind, a zephyr's mournful voice, doth carry low\nThe whispers of the trees, as ancient secrets they bestow\nTheir trunks, like pillars steadfast, hear and keep\nThe music of the woodland creatures, wild and carefree\n\nA brook, a river of song, doth flow and glide\nThrough glades and clearings, where thy beauty doth reside\nIts gentle melody, a lullaby sweet\nEchoing through the forest, as the heart doth greet\n\nThe stars above, like diamonds in the night\nDo twinkle with a heavenly music, pure and bright\nThe world, in slumber deep, is lulled to sleep\nBy the enchanting serenade of the woodland's keep\n\nO, fairest woods, thy magic doth enthrall\nMy heart, my soul, my every waking call\nTo dance beneath thy boughs, and feel the music rise\nIn harmony with nature, where I come alive.",
