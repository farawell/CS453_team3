The swift wove finest tapestries in naught but minutes; their threads danced with haste, without the tender care that doth make fine art.\n\n\"Slow as did the second, his master told him to complete his work before day's break. 'Twas a task of great complexity, for a king's cloak required many layers and hues. The slow weaver toiled patiently all night long, whilst the swift dweller sought to hasten the process by cunning devices.\n\n\"One fateful evening, as both works neared completion, disaster struck! A mighty storm did rage near, threatening to unravel all their handiwork. Yet, when the winds did howl and rain did pour, the slow weaver's cloak remained steadfast, while the swift's tapestry lay rent asunder.\n\n\"The king, who had spent the evening attending to his own affairs, rose before dawn to inspect both weavings. Beholding slumbering threads of fate, which held promise yet unforeseen, he spake unto his first weaver: 'How wondrous thy patience hath preserved my cloak! But now, alas, I see how hastiness caused calamity.'\n\n\"The swift waverfied and confessed to folly; for in eagerness he had rushed past all due consideration's calmness. The king, wise and just, did heed his word: 'In times of need, the patient weaver doth prove himself the most virtuous.'",
