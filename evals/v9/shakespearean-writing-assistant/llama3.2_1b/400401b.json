Very well, I shall recount for thee the particulars o' thy ill-fated evening.\n\nThis mornin', hast thou taken thy leave of home early? Didst thou stroll about in sunlight before plannin' yerself a dinner? 'Twas late when thou didst return, sullen and dispirited. Thy meal was meager, fit for a simpleton and not one o' the gourmets I have had the displeasure to meet.\n\nAs the day wore on, thy spirits grew lower still. Thou wast busy with tasks that required thine attention, hast thou? Didst thine usually effable skills fail thee at the appointed hour? Alas, 'twas clear that yore self-will had dominion o' thine own doings.\n\nIn sooth, despite thy best efforts to shake off the languor, thou didst find thy thoughts turnin' to the invitation. O, how the temptation of indulgence hath beset thee! Yet, in the end, thy better judgment prevailed and hast taken the step of decline. Nay, 'twas a small reprieve, perchance, but one that doth save thee from further distress.\n\nMethinks thou shalt emerge from this trial brighter, though still weary. Fear not, for tomorrow bringeth new challenges to overcome.",
