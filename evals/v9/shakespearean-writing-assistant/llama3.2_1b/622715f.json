  "output": "O, woe is me! A soul adrift in fate's dark shroud,\nWith winds that howl like beasts and waves that wildly crowd\nThe fragile vessel I am bound to, cursed to roam,\nA prisoner of nothing more than sun's pale gloom.\n\nMethinks, my ship did set sail on a fairer tide,\nWith purpose guiding us towards safe harbor's side.\nBut now, alas! I am astray, lost in the vast sea's design,\nAbandoned by all that once gave hope and gentle sheen.\n\nOh, cruel Fortune, why dost thou play such spite?\nDidst I not heed the warnings, or o'ffered a prayer to Fate?\nYet still, this torment grips me like a deathly snare,\nA constant terror, gnawing at my heart's deep lair.\n\nMy mind doth reel with visions of life past and gone,\nOf loved ones left behind, and friends whose bonds had won\nMe strong and steadfast on the turbulent stream,\nNow broken as glass, where shards of hope did gleam.\n\nYet still I press on, driven by a madness dire,\nA morbid fascination with the black waves' dark fire.\nFor in their depths, some hidden secret I implore,\nSome mysterious truth that lies beyond mortal lore.\n\nOr perchance, dear Providence, thou art my sole guide,\nAnd in thy mercy dost ordain this tempest-tossed tide?\nNo, never say'd I would turn faithless to the skies above,\nBut now, where reason falters, and my senses rechoose\n\nA ship to sail no more? A man lost beyond recall?\nThe abyss yawns wide beneath me, void of peace or gentle fall.\nYet still I cling to life as fleeting thought doth swiftly flee.",
