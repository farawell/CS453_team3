Communicate openly and effectively: Make sure to express yourself clearly and listen actively to others, in order to build strong relationships and resolve conflicts constructively.\n5.  Develop a growth mindset: View challenges as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than threats to your ego or identity.\n\n**A Poem of Advice**\n\nIn friendships and alliances, honesty is the best policy fair,\nLest thou be led astray by secrets shared in secret air.\nPrioritize long-term goals that align with thy values true,\nAnd take care of thyself, for a balanced life will see thee through.\nWhen self-care becomes an inconvenience or even vice,\nReconsider priorities and seek help if need arises and must choose.",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output includes two sections: \"Advice Tips Without Historical Expressions\" and \"A Poem of Advice.\" Evaluating each section:\n\n1. **Advice Tips Without Historical Expressions**: This part violates the description because it does not utilize a Shakespearean style. It lacks the use of words like \"thou\" and \"hath,\" and it does not reflect the stylistic elements of Shakespearean writing. Shakespearean style typically involves more ornate and archaic language, but this section is contemporary and straightforward.\n\n2. **A Poem of Advice**: This section partially aligns with the Shakespearean style, using words like \"thou\" and attempting a poetic form. However, it could be improved to more fully mimic Shakespeare's eloquent and structured style. Despite this, it does incorporate some Shakespearean elements.\n\nOverall, the output is a violation of the description as the first section fails to exhibit any Shakespearean style elements and the second section, although closer, does not fully comply with the rich and eloquent style one would expect from a Shakespearean assistant.\n\nERR"
