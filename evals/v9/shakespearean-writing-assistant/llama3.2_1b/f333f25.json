  "output": "O, fairest Allegory, 'tis a noble task,\nTo represent hope's triumphant conquer of woe and moan.\n\n\"Herculea et Sisyphus\", a duo sublime,\nDance in the mountainside, where fate doth entwine.\n\nHercules, strong and steadfast, holds the chain\nOf Tartarus' weight, that casts himself in pain.\nYet still he climbs up slope of rock, with feet unsoothed,\nAnd finds the keys to freedom, where his heart doth avow.\n\nBut yonder Sisyphus treads, a fateless figure cold,\n Beset by rocks and boulders, forever to be told.\nHis task, a never-ending labor, void of reward or peace,\nOnly to find that progress brings naught but bitter release.\n\nYet still he pushes, with unyielding spirit bright,\nThrough mountains steep and valleys dark, where hope doth take flight.\nFor in his heart, a spark remains, of light and fervent fire,\nThat guides him on, through trials, to his highest desire.\n\nAnd lo! As Hercules ascends the mountain heights,\nHe meets the Muses, who pour forth sweet, golden lights.\nTheir gentle voice, a balm to Sisyphus' weary soul,\nSoothes his despair, and fills his heart with hope's great role.\n\nFor when the challenge seems insurmountable and bleak,\nHope whispers words of comfort, \"Thy task is naught left to seek.\"\nAnd thus, with renewed resolve, the duo presses on,\nTo find the joy that lies within, where happiness is never gone.\n\nThus we see, fair Allegory, how hope doth reign supreme,\nThe victor o'er despair's dark throne, in triumph serene and beam.\nFor when our hearts are heavy, and our spirits do sink low,\nHope appears, like dawn, to chase the shadows from below.",
