  "output": "Fair sir or madam, thou dost ask for a tale,\nOf fables bearing on the theme of sharing's frail,\n'Twixt cunning fox and swift hare, whose hearts were keen,\nTo grasp and hold with grasping hands, but not equally serene.\n\nA gentle brook, that flowed near their homes so fair,\nDidst serve as witness to their disputations rare,\nThe fox didst boast of plenty of his store,\nWhile hare, in quietude, his meager store explored.\n\nOne sunny morn, when morning's warmth didst shine so bright,\nThe fox and hare didst meet on that verdant plain,\nTheir eyes, like embers, glowed with envy's fierce desire\nTo claim the brook as treasure to their willing fire.\n\n\"Hark!\" exclaimed fox, \"this brook doth belong to none,\nBut mine own, where I shall swim, my paws alone!\"\n\"Thou dost have more land than fertile ground,\" replied hare,\n\"What share canst thou give me, if not the forest's sacred lair?\"\n\nThus argument didst escalate, till both in anger stood,\nAt each other's feet, their reason lost in shouting.\nYet, as they paused, the brook's calm waters flowed,\nReflecting their troubled souls with mirrored mood.\n\nA wise old badger, who watched from nearby vantage,\nDidst whisper to them: \"When thou dost share thy store and space,\nConsider friendship shared, a treasure beyond compare.\"\n\nThus, fox and hare, in mellowed tones, didst agree,\nTo divide their stores, fair waters, fields of meadow, and trees so free,\nTheir bond now strengthen'd, with understanding's gentle might,\nA lesson learned: that toilsome sharing doth not bring endless night.\n\nAnd thus the tale, a testament to wisdom's pure light,\nFor sharing, though hard to grasp, can lead to love's most gentle sight.",
