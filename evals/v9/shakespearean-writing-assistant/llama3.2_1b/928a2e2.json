  "output": "Fair patron, thou dost request another tale,\nOf cunning foxes or swift-horned hare, sharing their gale?\nVery well, I shall spin for thee a yarn most fine,\nA lesson learned from fox and hare, in kindness divine.\n\nA fox, with eyes of cunning, a heart afire with guile,\nDidst spy the hare's most prized store, his summer's golden pile.\nHe snuck within the night, with stealthy, silent pace,\nAnd stole away with all the victuals in a hidden space.\n\nThe hare, a creature wise, didst wake to find the theft,\nHis stores laid bare, and naught but empty defeat.\nHe gazed with sorrowful eyes, his heart doth ache,\n\"Why did I share my bounty with this cunning pack?\"\n\nA gentle voice didst whisper in his ear, so kind,\n\"Consider not the fox's actions, noble hare, unwind.\"\n\nThus spake a wise old owl, whose wisdom was renowned,\nAnd gently taught the hares that sharing was not unkind.\nFor though the fox had won at first, his prize now lost its might,\nThe lesson learned within didst warm their hearts to new light.\n\nThey shared among themselves, in an equal share,\nTheir stores replenished, and gratitude did show their care.\nFrom then on, no more did they plot or steal and hoard,\nTheir bond of friendship strengthened, as love and trust were poured.\n\nThus the moral stands, fair friends:\nTo lend thine hand to others, in this life we tread,\nIs to find joy and peace, for kindness is indeed fed.",
