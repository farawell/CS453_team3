The light from the setting sun casts eerie shadows around.)**\n\n**Ghost:** (whispering menacingly) Thou hast wronged me, mortal coil, and now I shall make thee pay.\n\n**Living One:** What sorcery is this? A ghost speaks?\n\n**Ghost:** (with an air of superiority) Ah, thou dost fear thyself. Very well, then. Let us see whose terror doth enthrall the living.\n\n**Living One:** But what hast thou done, to incur my wrath?\n\n**Ghost:** (chuckling coldly) A trifling matter. Thou shalt pay for the affrontesst of me: disquieting thy slumber, and torturing thine own flesh...\n\n**Living One:** How dost thou know so? We can't converse.\n\n**Ghost:** (laughing once more) Ah, but I see the rickety bridge 'twixt us. Thou art bound to thy duties now. The rest is naught but tedious dreams to thee.\n\n(Illustration: A shadowy, grasping figure looms at the edge of the room, with wisps of mist curling around its features.)\n\n**Living One:** Enough!\n\n**Ghost:** (dismissing) Bah! Thou dost no more command me. (fades into the shadows)\n\n(An unsettling silence falls upon the chamber, as if the very presence of the ghost still haunts the air.)",
