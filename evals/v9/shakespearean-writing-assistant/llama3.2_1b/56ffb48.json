A lone figure stands at the window, a ghostly apparition shrouded in darkness.)\n\nGhost (Voiced by himself): **\"Thou hast wronged me, mortal! Thou hast cut me down to naught but specter!\"**\n\n**One Who Wronged Him:**\n(A grizzled old man enters the room, unaware of the presence lurking above.)\n\nOld Man: What is it? Can't a fellow even enjoy his midnight whiskey around here?\n\nGhost (Voiced): \"Awhirl thou wilt be, when I take vengeance for the death! For in my time, I wore mortal garb, and with thy care, didst lay low my maker!\"\n\n**The Old Man:**\n\"Who... who are you? Oh great ghost, have mercy! I won't hurt anyone.\"\n\nGhost (Voiced): \"Mercy? Hark! 'Tis not thy pity that doth trouble me now, but wrath and hunger for revenge. Thou seestered mine own soul from earth, and turned it to dust and darkness –\"\n\n\"Farewell, spectral fiend!\" The old man cackles.\n\nGhost (Voiced): \"Thou may't flee from justice, mortal; yet I'll show thee how I know thy mind! In the halls of death, my restless spirit doth exact revenge on those who wronged me – and never forget. Thou hadst best not harm another soul in all thy long, lingering days!\"\n\n(The ghost disappears into thin air, cackling maniacally.)\n\nOld Man: \"I... I've been cursed too, it seems.\"",
