Hast thou seen him?\nO, cruel fate, I had thought to take him through flames\nAnd still, thy face doth make my heart ache anew.\n\nMARIANNE:\nAlas, dear Thomas, 'tis not the wars that bring\nMy weeping tears, but our love's sweet pain and sting.\nI've seen too many battles for my love true,\nTo fear or hope for him again, thus worn.\n\nTHOMAS:\nThen I shall sit by thee, and in thy love I'll stay,\nAnd hear thee tell the tale of his great deeds each day.\nI shall make amends, and with mine armor clean, return\nO'er borders fresh, with heart o' gold, and honor's golden sheen.\n\n**(The two entwine, sharing tender kisses)**\n\n(Marianne's words do now have a chance to be spoken)\n\nMARIANNE:\nO Thomas, love dost makest this harsh world so fair,\nYet on thy return, I shall see the truth that's rare -\nThy wounds, though deep, will heal with time and care.\nAnd in thine eyes, my heart for ever hath a place to share.\n\n**(Out come words of thanks from her)**\nMARIANNE:\nO loving Thomas, here we are at last,\nTogether, safe, our love forever made.\n\n---\n\nThou hast enjoyed this romantic scene within!",
