  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output aligns significantly with the Shakespearean style described. It uses classical phrases and structure consistent with Shakespearean writing, such as \"thou,\" \"doth,\" \"dost,\" and \"fairest sister dear.\" The style is reminiscent of Shakespeare's verse, with rich imagery and expressive language that embodies the theme of loss. The content flows with lyrical rhythm and uses metaphors, which are characteristic of Shakespeare's style. I do not see any violations, as the entire response adheres to the expected Shakespearean style.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
