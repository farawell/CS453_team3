You need a few time frames to detect what the majority trend is. Too often a reversal candle occurs at the same point as the new hourly or 4-hourly bar, which can nullify the effect of the reversal. The power of this approach is that instead of relying upon single time frame signals, you use the multi time frame to \"confirm\" accuracy. There can still be false reversals, it is not magic.... but it does greatly diminish negative expectancy trades with an overall improved...\n\nCould you comment on your chart setup?

System very interesting, but would have some file for us put many pairs (as price to 100 our tradescanv1.ex4 ) but with alerts on signal candle. Because I think most reports will involve in buysellsignal indicator and fractals. the alert would come out only once every asset .. it would be really good. Wait. Thank you my friend and all staff.\n\nHi everyone\n\nI have attached a template of what I do personally with THV in post 2 - link\n\nI use it a bit different than with THV and mainly check slightly HTF for direction together with divergence\n\nI have attached some pictures of different methods and see if you find it useful in your general THV trading.\n\nI also watch the supertrend indi on the chart to show possible trends and how strong/convincing they are and trade that way.\n\nI use the Heiken_Ashi_Smoothed.ex4 only for a change of direction being likely to go back behind the 15/30 minute 7sma which is default on chart\n\nLike I said before I have the pipsometer for each pair in a grid on one chart so i can change setting giving me HA closed and Stoch extreme alerts so I can quickly analyse the pair in detail on the THV chart\n\nHope this helps generate different ideas in the way you trade THV\n\nHere are the original THV templetes\n\nThen my Template are attached and follow in the pictures below.\nIf you have any questions please just ask . All indicators are here in the Nihilist file except the one i added in my zip\n\n\nHere you just wait for the HA close away from the 7sma and the reaction of the fast and the MTF stochtatics. For longer trades you want all the stochstics facing in your direction.\n\nMy exit on all trades is either take profit or a 20 pips or a recross of the 7sma (10 ema would probably also be fine but i like the 7 sma as its faster)\n\nStops on the EU are 15 pips. Normal target are 30 pips\n\nI always look for some sort of conformation on higher timeframes as to where the main S/R is\n\n\nThis is my agressive version which can also be effective depending on the market conditions.\n\nI removed the coral and HA for a faster signal\n\nTypically you pick a direction based on the HTF:this one has 15 / 60 / D1 for direction and only trade when they are all in direction.\n\nStop is 15 pips and target is 20 pips\n\nCheers\n\nRooi\n\n\n{quote} Of course i want to be carefull  Thx a lot for the information Rooi\n\nAnother thing I've found with indicators is that slightly different settings can give the same answer... well at least the same result. I have had trouble matching the settings sometimes but then realized there may be other factors and inputs in there. What happens if you change hull's length from 5 to 8? Or color from 1 to -4? You'll observe the same end result potentially occurring, but at differing moments, with different configurations. Think of it like rolling the dice. But in the end the winner takes profit.\n\nI am in the process of measuring the statistical efficiency of a single timeframe strategy, working towards getting the logic straightened out for multi time frame EA. If I can determine a filter that greatly reduces false signals, the EA will be much easier to finish. The fact is, once concept is coded it leads to more refinement.\n\nRooi, and All Please load this version of Cool Tech and please share your ideas: you prefer to hide hash-color or not...etc. Another thing: you can add an RSI for all TF, and completes your diagram. If you have further ideas as request of indicators to work directly in the indi (MultiTF), please raise your voice {file} PS: it will alert you by email and sound when a change occurs\n\nThanks for the work !\n\nI will try it out come London Open tomorrow and report back.\n\nI will have a look at RSI again instead of Stochs\n\nSee you all tomorrow\n\nRooi\n\n\nMorning guys\n\nTo be totally honest and blunt\nI am finding it to be a bit to messy to trade with the changing colors and displaying it on the chart at the same time.Having it as a separate window its no issues but the chart itself has become very busy that being said its good to have the option and certainly much better than repainting hash though.\n\nMy personal feeling might be a MTF macd instead of all those hash might be better solution if one wants to use that type of filter on the chart.\nAlso have the option to have just the arrow ( I have never used arrow so this is new for me and not sure its needed,it changes really often but I suppose having it on three tf's might really help if the settings are correct)\n\nGoing to go live at LO with the template as i uploaded as template1 in post 2 .Will try and post before I enter a trade.Live Trade Explorer will be up as always\n\nLets see what the day has to offer\n\nRooi\n:nerd:\n\nThanks, but I prefer longer period Alligator. Remember to be able to trade multi-tf with the main signals generated correctly you must link the MTF to signals on H4 or D1 timeframe.\n\nThe point is that the M5 shows many zig zags up and down, so it is hard to pickup both short trend following or reversals accurately... when you look at multiple timeframes you see gradual development. So we need to firm up some pending set of rules that takes care of noise so that we get trades that are not prone to high degree of falseness.\n\nA nice pull back to 7-10 pip profitable trade on M5 based on retest of zero level but had to wait for M1 to bottom out first\n\nThen become overbought before selling off and falling through the 7sma of the M1.\n\nAnother little trade and into bed for me\n\nRooi\n\n\nI have tested the new MTF version, it's working fully loaded with all options and it works great.

Can you explain how it works please many thanks. Rooi \n\nYes...It's very easy!\n\n1.- Retesting the \"zero lines\" of the indicators.... price will enter into a congestion area and then an explosive breakout could happen.\n2.- Waiting for a valid breakout/Scalping.\n3.- The idea of multi-frame is simple...If you have 30M green or red, accompanying with General Trend (GT0) indicator color the entry on 5 Min or 1M \"w\" initialy.\n4.- The re-entry w-line is the same.\n3.- Other option: Watch the color of 30M in a separated window with the Stochastic 50 and 100 to confirm some conditions for enter on 5 or 1? If this option enough, we can simplify the input signals to screen a chart window or template indicator (using the scrip that Rooi use to be in charge of all related currencies).\n5.- As more trader's testing, more inputs coded to share become possible.\n\nWe can put all together, or...by parts until the whole strategy appears to have more concretion.\n\nGood...and again very good day to traders.\n\nGreat that the indicators on the main chart has the option to be removed - Not for me as personal taste and in order to keep the chart clear and easy\n\nThis combined with V4 seems to be working well for me but really excited to trade it with some good news over the next few days adding the extra charts to confirm the smaller timeframes .\n\nAs always - Thanks for the effort to Nihilist and Hari\n\nHappy Friday\n\nRooi\n\n\nGreat that the indicators on the main chart has the option to be removed - Not for me as personal taste and in order to keep the chart clear and easy This combined with V4 seems to be working well for me but really excited to trade it with some good news over the next few days adding the extra charts to confirm the smaller timeframes .

I avoid trying to hog wild market consolidation and let the most recent direction of 1H and 30M define direction... nothing else, nothing fancy, and clear coloration makes decisions sound.\n\nUsing a stacked MAs approach such as alligator allows clear presentation of direction. This is slightly different to foregoing concept, since the aim here is precision of entries rather than chasing market. Coral here is redundant.\n\nIt's better to examine the approach of \"precision entries\" versus \"chasing market\". Both are valid approaches. However, the difference is: patience, accuracy, profit taking and stop strategy.\n\nI think the area you highlighted is good for textbook case, or heavy learning. Shows clear divergence, this alone with proper exit rule or separate indicator in opposite direction will be successful. As is every current signal. Pick what works for you.\n\nRooi I would suggest entering long on Friday at ~11:30am your chart Kenobi post #112 based on the m30 over sold. This will get you in on the initial upmove followed by pull back leading into next M30 bar candle which triggers.\n\nOf course this upcoming algorithm I hope to re-create should cover this scenario (global filter), composite strategy is paramount to distinguish true/false trending movement aspects.\n\n,,,,,,\n\nBottom line: M5 scalping is best treated reward wise at least 2:1.\n\nDear Nihilist, I want to say thank you for sharing your tools with traders here on FF.

I wish you many blessings and strength and guidance through difficult times!\n\nSo far I've added coolTF Alert and loaded the HolyGrail Matrix v7 (as attached). I'm an M15 and H1 addict....in the process of testing this setup and am still catching on to the process. But spinning hash thingy causing a headache \n\nI'm done for the week too, speaking in general I find to be quite unpredictable, and suits a contrary strategy....the week ahead looks very enticing with some good stuff to hit up, until then, take care\n\nD\n\nthx mate, the new version is yummy ^__^\nPerformance depends on imagination\nPlease take your time.

I believe it will be include in next EA version (Profitable almost very MT4).\n\nBe in touch Friends and... again\n\n{quote} The thin market can whipsaw a lot. Be careful about the multi time brokers. There is some second order effects, and I haven't integrated and measured that. Anyway, it should become clear that they all match sooner or later. I suggest being careful with reversal signals. Like cut losses after trend is clearly proven to be over. Otherwise posting good demo results can be done on this thread, but emulating it in real money (proper funding) is a whole order of difficulty harder. Remember the great golden...\n\nHi Harry,\n\nThanks for your feedback. You're absolutely right. I am just trying to use it's full potential of MTF just to test on demo at the moment but planning to apply it for live account. Will post my finding here.

What I meant RE: the hash was, I think, similar to Rooi's thoughts - looking at the MTF window. Just my opinion right now...\nHope whatever is going on, you have strength and support where needed\nTake care,\nDale\n\nHello all, have a good evening. Please use CoolTF v7 and Enjoy. The are options for display if you don't want to see the main indicator chart, you can think of it Whenever you go fishing and breaking a 300 level fib plays key role. Each fib can be a Tp or sl or both. Green fibs downtrend / Red fib uptrend See fractals at Round Levels for continuation in direction when broke, before next fib. This apply for all...\n\nhi rockypoint can you share template please thank you\n\nBro i say again my T.H.G version 2 is smoother because it is different coded, so it act like that, and i like the look.\n\ngreat job what is your settings please\nOn my Nirvana and Adx on the NihilistCoolTrend, I set iShift=1;\nIt will give the same colours fo both M1 and M5\n\nI have attached the files on Post 2 together with the template below\n\nI believe this is what Nihilist said we should look out for.One of the indicatores to be multi time frame and the others individual that have their own setting so we can see the possible OB/OS and divergence( if one trades it with divergence that is to say)\n\nRooi\n\n\nThx guys, I will be switching some of my time to timed trading starting this summer, at least for awhile, as this may consume some time.\n\nMy first goal will be automating a design for pre-defined time settings for each pair.\n\nI have a statistic sheet which came close to optimising hourly trends, which I referenced back to the BSN indicator for cycle trends, voila, 3 different things looking at the same point yet another factor...worth time ATM to build this element into a EA, will have time structures built-in...could take some effort.\n\nHave a nice weekend.\n\nKind Regards,\nHarry\n\nWho here want to test the MTF EA when I finish it? please let me know.\n\nI'm not really experienced but can help with testing if needed.\n\nSorry to hear about your problems Rooi \n\nI have tested the new MTF version, it's working fully loaded with all options and it works great.

Anyway...GOOD LUCK to those who want to improve this and are collaborating...to such people make us to continue hard working on projects. Best, TS {file} {file} {file} {file}\n\nHello Nihilist and harri,\n\nI have been looking to your system, trying to figure out how to apply to my chart. I am used to daily trading. So, the lowest time frame I use to trade on is the 1 hour chart. Can the system be applied that way, in case it was made for lower time frames(intervals)? Thanks.\nMy new way : How to catch 100 pips per swing with low risk high reward\n\nHere , i want to share you my new tool, which i am testing with my friend. one important thing this is not same as T.F.T. work differently. I have removed my older tool \"virgin Super Trend V1\" because this one is latest version of that indicator with improved formula and better alignment and coding too.\n\nUse it on 5 min TF to 1 hour chart with CSM_current_Weekly.\nThis combination is perfect.\n\nget exact alignment and ride trend, we are using it as a trend following strategy.\n\ngood luck\n\nPlease find the new attached here..... and use properly\n\n\nHI Nihilist Fantastic one. How to install or access the CFG file in the .ex4 indicator you gave you, debug not work without .mq4 file Just for you know, I am testing two cross alerts one on 1M aggregated and the other from 5M at zero-cross, I thing this. 1st was to truly enjoy what I have achieved thus far. Like you say, it seems we are always looking for something slightly different that we tell ourselves will help us more. It rarely really does. Key here is to mention the notion to be at peace with you current approach and simply experiment in small size with things to hone your edge. 2nd, keep up on spending time/analysis after market hours. Even if I do not see what I need immediately, I give my subconscious time to chew on things so potentially leads to important insights....\n\nIt is important to take a time away from desk to look the method from distance...then you can back whit clearer ideas...\nYou are welcome at any time.\n\nPoints:\nRemember the most easy way: The H (1,30,4) is the GT indicator and 5-time gives us entries and validation (+stochastic, low speed, alert when extreme only).\nMost of the days are similar kind of days...it will help us to clarify our daily goal.\n\nBest regards,\nTP\n1\n\nMy new way : How to catch 100 pips per swing with low risk high reward {image} {file} {file} {file} {file} {file} {file} {file}\n\nMany thanks Nihilist\n\nI will have a look and report back\n\n\n\nHi.many thanks for new improved indicators ,ihave some trades from tokyo with both thesystem, one as template 1 setting,second as my template.Happy green pips!!!\n\nWhen possible maybe someone can advise on looking on those trades,where i went Wrong? thank u  in advance\n\nAndre\n\nPS was not able to upload screenshots its in document not on meta trader 4 any suggestions? thanks\n\nHi.many thanks for new improved indicators ,ihave some trades from tokyo with both thesystem, one as template 1 setting,second as my template.Happy green pips!!!

Remember to be able to trade multi-tf with the main signals generated correctly you must link the MTF to signals on H4 or D1 timeframe. The point is that the M5 shows many zig zags up and down, so it is hard to pickup both short trend following or reversals accurately... when you look at multiple timeframes you see gradual development. So we need to firm up some pending set of rules that takes care of noise so that we get trades that are not prone to high degree of falseness.\n\nHello\n\nWould you mind sharing the settings for the alligator please.\n\nAlso am i right in saying(to sum up for noobs like me) we just follow the colors on the analyser on the HTF .Lets say the green for H1 on the left most square and enter on LTF,currently being M5,when we have a valid entry signal.\n\nThanks a lot\n\nRooi\n\nhi harri, i have tried the cooltpl with adx , i need to understand how the arrow( MTFFX in the indicator that represent the momentum) , it change every candle M1 or there is a specific setting on it too? because i noticed on M1 timeframe it give me sometimes a reasonable same direction trades, pls clarify that for us, you use The momentum or other indicator on dashes ( TF) in your main method? i have tested dashes indi/system morning, it interesting, just have to figure when u enter and when to exit.\n\nFor the EA i propose option of a maximum trade per hour in any currency!!!\nwhere could put take profit or only signal/stoptrade option on 15 or 20 pips\n\nCheers\n\nAndre \nROOI: hope you feelings are Ok.. Many thanks for your welcomed comments, we will try to clarify as much and quickly as we can.\nAndre: I'm using MTFFX signals/stochastic 50 or 100 from highertimeframes as direction. Keep testing...\nYour idea of a variable of max-trades it's ok so I will include into EA.\nH1 on smaller TF must be confirmed by the ADX (cross 0 line).. H1TF and ADX0 are GT and M5 alone the entry scalp.\nWill reply to all...what do you mean by spread rent-free trading on my chart during day\". I though maybe you want the know how the ultimate profit without sl stop trades works, or how you do it manually....what´s the rule you use exactly to exit with your gains....exits are more important than entrance as we know.. waiting for good ideas we will be coding it in the next MTFEA Version release.\n\nThanks to all. \nNihilist MA Below 60 - Setting (4,13,20 if i remember correctly)\n\n\nNo trades for me this morning and my question is exactly how do you guys use the dashboard?\n\nLook at my settings in post#110\n\nM1 is OB with Daily and H1\n\nRooi\n\n\nNihilist MA Below 60 - Setting (4,13,20 if i remember correctly)  {image} No trades for me this morning and my question is exactly how do you guys use the dashboard?

It can be placed directly on your metatrader code and also with template.
