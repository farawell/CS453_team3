Using indirect language to describe emotions and actions.\n2. Employing metaphors (e.g., \"lure me to shadows,\" \"phantom thread\"), which create a sense of ambiguity without explicit declaration.\n3. Building tension through imagery (e.g., \"whispered promise of delight,\" \"darkness we'll convene\").\n4. Leaving some details open to interpretation, allowing the listener's imagination to fill in the gaps.\n\nBy avoiding direct clarity in language, this song invites the listener to participate in the mystery, creating a sense of intrigue and excitement around the unknown emotions and desires at play.",
