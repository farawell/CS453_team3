My heart\nDoth ache with thoughts of love, that hath departed nigh.\nForgive me, fair one, for I have penned none this day.\n\nTHE MOUSE:\nThy words, poor poet, tell a tale of woe,\nAnd sorrow's sting doth pierce thy sensitive soul.\nI see the ravages of grief, the ache o'er thy brain,\nThe tears thou dost not dry, nor withered art in vain.\n\nPOET:\nO, gentle Muse, thou speakest true and kind. \nMy love didst flee before our vows were throned.\nNo solace came from words, but sorrow's sharp\nCut doth now pierce my heart, as winter's icy claw\n\nTHE MOUSE:\nThou hast not seen me here, nor heard what I say,\nYet in my whispers lie secrets of the day.\nIn dreams and madness, visions of our love didst play.\n\nPOET:\nFie on this wretched night! What ailed me to keep\nMy emotions locked within the heavy walls that dwell? \nHast thou seen when hearts do ache as these mine own?\n\nTHE MOUSE:\nNay, poet, sorrow's pangs may be severe,\nBut 'tis in thy art that solace dost retrieve.\nWhen words fail thee, then listen to my song,\nAnd let the melody of love be thine inspiration strong.\n\n(Exeunt)",
