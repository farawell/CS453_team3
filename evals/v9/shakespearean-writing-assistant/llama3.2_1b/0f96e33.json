  "output": "O fair youth, with heart aflame and mind so bright,\nThou art beset by fancies that doth take flight.\nLife's fleeting beauty doth entice thee to roam,\nYet in its swift departures, I do find it cold e'er home.\n\nLike summer's bloom, that waxes fast and fades away,\nOur moments sparkle brief as starlight of the day.\nA glance of love, a smile of joy, a whispered tale so fine,\nAll swiftly lost, as morning dew doth silently decline.\n\nThe whispering wind, that stirs our hearts' deep sighs,\nDoth borrow naught but whispers from the passing times.\nEach breath we take doth breathe, and in its fleeting frame,\nI find no lasting essence, save a shadow of thy name.\n\nAnd so I shall not yield to allurements of delight,\nFor life's great lessons lie within darkness' somber night.\nFor thou hast lived with joys and wounds of mortal strife,\nAnd in the end, thou must confront thy own sweet rife.",
