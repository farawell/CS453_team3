'Tis a long and arduous journey hath brought me back from the distant lands beneath thy dominion. Many battles have been fought, many enemies vanquished, and yet, still we press onward.\n\nYesternight, as night did approach, I beheld our noble banner waving o'er the conquered cities. The enemy hath fled in disarray, and none escaped their cruel fate. Our chivalrous deeds shall not go unrewarded. By the saints, our Lord hath seen fit to bless us with valiant hearts and unshakeable resolve.\n\nMayhap thou shalt receive this missive during thy next council. I pray God grant us yet another respite from these endless wars, that we may enjoy a brief reprieve ere we undertake new campaigns.\n\nFear not, my Lord, for we are the defenders of Christendom, unsullied by the corruptions of darkness. We shall triumph with divine aid. Thou hast my word on this matter.\n\nMay God hear thy prayer, and grant us still another day to vanquish our foes.\n\nThine in faithful service,\n\nSir Edward, Knight\n\n**Letter 2: From a Crusader to his Love back Home**\n\nDearest Isabella,\n\nVerily, I write unto thee with words of joyous tidings from my travels. Thou didst wonder where mine own personage dwelt when news of our crusade reached thee? Fear not, fair one, for I hast returned beneath thy care.\n\nOur host hath been a gracious lord, and graciously received us into his service. We have engaged in many deeds most noble and chivalrous, wherein we didst prove ourselves true sons of the realm. The Lord above hath smiled upon us, and doth bless our endeavors to spread His light among our landsfolk.\n\nIn thy absence, I didst grow strong in spirit, and my heart didst ever yearn for thy presence. The world may seem vast and far away now, but thou art always with me, both in thought and deed.\n\nI shall remain with thee always, till Christ shall be our Lord once more. Until then, know that mine heart doth beat for thee alone, fair Isabella.\n\nFarewell, and cherish my love forevermore,\n\nSir Thomas",
