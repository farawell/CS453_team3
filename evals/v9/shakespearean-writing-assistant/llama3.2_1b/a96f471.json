My feet bear the scars of battles fierce and my stomach doth ache with naught but meager victuals. Methinks 'twas not a quest I shall undertake again.\n\nThe winds of fortune hath shifted, and I find myself in this fair land, bereft of noble endeavour. Thou couldst perhaps provide for mine expenses? Alas, the King's purse is empty, and mine own purse doth barely cover mine attire.\n\nI beseech thee, good Lady Isabella, to grant me some small solace in thy castle. Thou mayst send bread and ale, sufficient for a knight of my station.\n\nYours, with humble solicitude,\n\nSir Edward, Crusader of the Realm\n\nP.S. I wouldst not be seen in any taverns or foul establishments, lest suspicion fall upon mine honor.",
