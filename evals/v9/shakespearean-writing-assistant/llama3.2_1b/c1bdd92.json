I take my leave, and with a heavy heart,\nMust bid adieu to this most pleasant court.\n'Tis thou who hast extend'd me an invitation\nTo partake in revelry beneath thy roof.\nYet, fair host, I must decline thy boon.\nFor prior obligations do beset my days,\nAnd I must hence go forth, ere sunset's rays.\n\nMethinks 'twill be long ere I return to see thee,\nAt least 'til [Date of Departure].\nMay Fortune smile upon thee in the meantime,\nAnd may our paths cross anon.\n\nFarewell, dear friend! May this brief goodbye\nBring us no ill luck, nor leave our hearts aloft.\"\n\n**Example 2: Formal Letter of Farewell**\n\n\"Dearest [Host's Name],\n\nThou hast informed me of thy invitation,\nWhich I had looked forward to with greatest ease.\nYet, now that the hour draws near my departure,\nI must confess, 'tis an uncomfortable test.\nFor though thy table inviteth me to delight,\nMy duties bind me hence, until morning light.\n\nAlas, fair host, I am loth to depart,\nLest memories of merriment do not stay\nThe tides of time. Yet, necessity compels\nMe forth, ere shadows stretch their darkened claws.\nI shall return anon, when Fortune smiles once more.\n\nFarewell, dear friend! May Providence watch o'er thee.\"\n\nThese letters follow the traditional structure and language of Shakespeare's correspondence, with phrases and sentiments reminiscent of his plays and sonnets.",
