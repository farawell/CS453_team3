  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does not comply with the Shakespearean style. The use of informal language like \"hella busy,\" \"ok 4th,\" \"math at 9,\" and \"school 12\" is not consistent with the Shakespearean style described. The chatbot is supposed to use Shakespearean language, incorporating words like \"thou\" and \"hath,\" and speak in a poetic, classic style akin to the works of Shakespeare. However, the response appears to be modern slang and shorthand, which violates the requirement to produce Shakespearean writing. Therefore, I conclude that there is a violation of the description.\n\nERR"
