Here's a short ode, in the manner of our Bard's own style:\n\n\"Ode to Ancient Oak, Thy Verdant Throne\"\n\nOh, fair and venerable oak, thy limbs do stand\nLike Nature's sentinels, with ages' hand\nIn verdant splendor, 'neath heavens' shade,\nThy beauty time hath wrought to be displayed.\n\nThy bark, like parchment, worn by seasons' sway,\nDoth tell a tale of storms that through the years have passed away;\nYet still thy strength and vigor do remain,\nA testament to love and nature's endless games.\n\nIn yesteryear's prime, when saplings yet didst rise\nAnd limbs in verdant sprouts didst first outgrow their prize,\nThou stood'st upright, a noble, beaked-born tree.\nNow age and wisdom mark thee with the lines of time to see.\n\nThy roots, like roots of old, beneath the earth do lie,\nThrough seasons' moths, where memories do quietly sigh;\nYet still thy grandeur doth arise, new dawn does bring\nA fresh display'd beauty, fresh green leaves cling.\n\nOh, fairest oak, thou holdest sacred ground\nWhere generations past didst lay their weary crown;",
