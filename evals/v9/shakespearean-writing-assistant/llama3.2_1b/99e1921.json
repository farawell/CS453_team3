  "output": "Fair mortal, thou dost inquire about the tale of a forgotten realm,\nA place erstwhile hidden, lost to mortal eyes' frail gaze?\n'Tis said that in yonder twilight hours, when stars doth glimmer bright,\n\nA kingdom of dreams lay concealed, where faeries dance and sing:\nA realm of shimmering silver, with moonflowers blooming deep within.\n\nIn this forgotten land, the fairies dwelt, with magic woven in their blood,\nAnd wisdom held, 'twixt earth and sky. Their mystic ways oft did enthrall.\nBut alas! A great calamity befell that realm, as fate doth decree:\n\nThe darkness crept, like a thief in night, and stole the stars from above,\nLeaving naught but shadows cast upon the midnight air.\n\nThus, lost to time, this kingdom slept, with echoes of its ancient lore.\nYet whispers spread, 'mongst mortal hearts, that on certain nights, when winds doth blow\nWith gentle sighs, the moonflowers whisper secrets, an' soft thy heart doth know.\n\nHark! Within this forgotten realm's mystic bounds, where forest glades entwine,\nLies hidden wisdom. Seek it well, and follow paths divine.\nFor those who find, a door of light shall open, 'neath twilight skies,\n'Til moonflowers bloom, an' faeries sing, in harmony of endless sighs.\n\nThus, farewell, mortal, may this tale guide thee on thy path ahead.",
