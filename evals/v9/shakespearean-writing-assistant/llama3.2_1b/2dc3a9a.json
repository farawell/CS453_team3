Two lovers stand facing each other, their arms entwined but their gazes fixed on some point beyond the horizon.]\n\nLover 1: (sighing) \"Farewell, fair maiden, may Fortune smile upon thy endeavors.\"\n\nLover 2: (with equal melancholy) \"Aye, fairest love, thou dost bid me adieu. May I behold thee again beneath this starry sky.\"\n\nLover 1: \"I care not what the future holds, nor what fate doth sow\nIn thee my heart doth sow its sweetest flowers,\nBut now, as night's dark veil doth shroud us here,\nThou must depart me to thy own desires.\"\n\nLover 2: \"O, why must I leave? My heart doth ache\nTo bask within thine radiant light and love.\nYet I know thou art bound by duties of another\nHeart that in my absence fawns in sorrow.\"\n\nLover 1: \"Thou dost mistake the burden of thy love. I too had thoughts,\nTo be with thee, to cherish every moment you bestowed on me.\nBut now 'tis done; and for mine own peace, I must away.\"\n\nLover 2: \"Stay true, my dearest, though we chanced not share\nA kiss beneath thine lips upon this lonely hill.\nFor in thy love, thou art my guiding star,\nThat shines no less brightly than the radiant morning's mirth.\"\n\nLover 1: \"Th'art hard to understand. Farewell, fair maid.\"\n\"May Fortune smile upon thee; and may Fortune favour\nThy heart which doth love beyond compare.\"\n\n[With those final words of affection and warning,\nThe two lovers part, each returning to their separate path,\nAs the moonlight casts its silvery glow on them both.]",
