Fie on these fears!\nBut how to shake them? Ah, how to tears!\nTo calm the tempest in my soul, and still\nThe stormy winds that rage, and whirl, and spill.\n\nO, time, how cruel art thou! Thou dost afflict me,\nA queen, a prisoner of life's dark strife.\nYet still I'll rise up, and face these pains,\nAnd for my kingdom, I shall wear this crown of shame.",
