A sudden gust didst whip through the air,\nAnd Tiberius' scepter flew from his hand, beyond repair.\nMarcellus seized upon the fallen crown,\nAnd held it high, as symbol of his victory to renown.\n\nTiberius, enraged, with wrath's dark fire,\nDidst vow for justice, and a kingdom to preserve.\n\"I shall have thee brought before this Council,\" he didst decree,\n\"And punished for your treachery!\"\n\nThe guards didst approach, with stern commands dire,\nAnd Marcellus stood tall, his heart with noble fire.\n\n\"Fie on thy sentence!\" he didst loudly cry,\n\"For justice shall be served, thou shalt not pass by!\"\n\nTiberius' temper flared like a royal flame,\nAs discord brews, and strife doth reign supreme in this palace game.\n\n---\n\nThou hast been presented with this dramatic scene. Mayhap 'twill inspire a stirring tale of ambition, pride, and power.",
