A secret alliance strong?\n\n\"A confederacy of nations, sworn in secret's bond,\nDoth aid thee, Queen Calantha, with foreign aid, unbound.\nThe mighty Roman legion, with their might and power,\nShall stand by thee, to crown our usurper's hour.\"\n\n\"Fie on this treachery!\" the queen didst exclaim,\n\"The weight of Rome's disdain doth heavy upon thy throne's bower in vain.\nFor what is power, short-lived, ere it's lost to fate?\nIs not a tyranny that with oppression waits.\"",
