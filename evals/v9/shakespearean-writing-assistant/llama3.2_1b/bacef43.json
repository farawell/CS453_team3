  "output": "When in days of yore, wherein honor's theme was played,\nA knight arose, with valor as his noble sway,\nHis steed, by Fortune's will, to trust in him did bring.\n'Twas named Galahad, stalwart, strong, and full of might.\n\nTheir bond, forged in battles fierce and far-off,\nDid grow, as seasons turned, and winter's chill was torn,\nThrough forests dark, where fearsome beasts did roam,\nGalahad stood, unwavering, to his knight's right home.\n\nIn verdant meadows, where wildflowers bloomed with pride,\nThe Knight and Galahad would ride, side by side,\nTheir footsteps quiet on the soft earth's decay,\nAs they explored realms uncharted, come what may.\n\nWith gentle care, the Knight tended Galahad's might,\nHe fed him sweet hay, and watered his eyes bright,\nAnd when he fell from pursuit, in weary fray,\nGalahad stood by him, through dawn's gray morning ray.\n\nTheir trust transcended time, as epochs went to naught,\nFor in each other's hearts, their friendship did enshroud,\nAs days of sunshine joined by ebon star above,\nDid symbolize the bond 'twixt mortal and a knight of love.\n\nWhen battles raged, and strife did shake the land,\nThe Knight would whisper calm, when Galahad's gentle head did stand,\nHe knew his steed was vigilant, strong as mountain stone,\nUnwavering loyalty in heart doth call him home.\n\nAnd so the quest continues, through triumphs and defeat,\nFor this unbreakable bond 'twixt knight and horse, to greet.\nThough fate may bring them near or far apart,\nTheir friendship endures, a beacon in the dark of night.",
