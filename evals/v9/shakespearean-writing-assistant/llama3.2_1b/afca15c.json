Here are two stanzas, penned in my Shakespearean style:\n\n**Stanza 1**\nMortal hands that hold the clock's dark tide,\nDo vainly grasp the passing hour inside,\nFor Time,\nLike Maelstrom's waves, do e'er recede and roar,\nNor can thy fleeting moments be denied.\nInconstant friend, 'tis gone, and we are left\nTo mourn its loss in endless night.\n\n**Stanza 2**\nWhen golden suns and lunar beams aloft,\nDo chase the shadows from the morning's heart,\nAnd mortal breath doth life and vigor bring,\nYet Time,\nLike thieves, do creep into our busy lives,\nStealing moments lost in restless sighs\nAnd leaving naught but empty, hollow space.",
