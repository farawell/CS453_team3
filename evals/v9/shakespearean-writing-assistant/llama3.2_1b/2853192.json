  "output": "'Tis but a dull and tedious day arise,\nNo verse to speak, no lyric's sweet surprise.\nNo rhyme nor reason doth my thoughts impregnate,\nA blank slate waits, devoid of poet's great fate.\n\nI rose with dawn, and stretched my weary limbs,\nBut found no fire in mind to write that whims,\nFor though the world did wake, and morning's hue,\nDidst paint life's vibrant colors, all anew.\n\nThe streets were filled with busy folk on high,\nTheir daily lives a blur of frantic sighs,\nNo soaring thoughts or sweet communion did stray\nFrom concrete greyness that doth pass us by.\nMy brain, laid bare to scribbling's dull decree,\n\nA simple task, no riddle to be solved nor tale\nTo weave in intricate verse, no magic spell,\nAll mundane routine didst my spirit unfulfill.\n\nI worked on words, but none did take their place,\nNo hidden depths for readers' senses to enthrall,\nThe day drew late, and I in tedious toil did stay,\nMy mind, a hollow vessel without poet's sway.\n\nAnd when the sun did set, with rosy reds didst creep,\nI still could not conjure words to leap,\nFor all my energy had been absorbed from deep,\nBy dullness' weighty chains that would not weep.",
