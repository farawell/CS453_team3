  "output": "Fair sir or fair madam, 'tis with great perturbation that I express my inclination to forgo the pleasure of dining with thee this eve. Regrettably, mine obligations do attend upon me with an unrelenting ferocity, compelling me to take up arms against the shadows that have beset my evening.\n\nAlas, fair hostess, thy invitation hath fallen upon mine ears like a sweet serenade, only to be promptly and hastily withdrawn from consideration. My own affairs do demand my full attention, and I must forthwith return to those that beckon me with all due haste.\n\nA hundredfold doth thy offer rankle in my breast, yet by the honor of our former acquaintance, I find myself bound to decline as is my wont when in such parlous employ.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The output provided by the chatbot adheres to the Shakespearean style as described in the chatbot's instructions. It utilizes typical Shakespearean language and constructs, such as \"thou,\" \"mine,\" \"hath,\" \"doth,\" \"tis,\" and phrases reminiscent of Shakespeare's texts. The text is also written in a formal and poetic manner, capturing the essence of the style required - much like a soliloquy or a letter one might find in a Shakespearean play. It addresses the recipient in a deferential and elaborate manner, consistent with the time period's language use. Additionally, it elegantly communicates the message of declining an invitation, which aligns with the example provided in the description. Since the evaluation strictly focuses on stylistic compliance and does not require knowledge of functional correctness or the input, this output satisfies all description requirements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
