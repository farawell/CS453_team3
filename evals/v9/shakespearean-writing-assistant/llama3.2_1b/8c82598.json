  "output": "Fair patron, thou seekest a fable writ,\nTo teach the virtues of patience, and make them sit.\n\nIn twilight's hush, where forest creatures roam,\nA youth didst wander, with heart full of disdain.\nHe spurned invitation from a goodly friend,\nWho sought his counsel, and a share of dinner's end.\n\n\"Marry, dear friend,\" quoth the youth, with scornful sneer,\n\"Thy feast is but a trifling matter; speed thee hence!\"\nBut soft! The wind didst whisper secrets in his ear,\nAnd wisdom whispered low: \"Patience, be thy peer.\"\n\nHe hearkened not, nor took heed of gentle words,\nAnd with each passing hour, his resolve didst impair.\nHe sought to hurry through the evening's delight,\nYet delay shone forth like a dark and foetid night.\n\nThe sun grew late, the stars didst appear,\nAnd in the guest chamber, cold candlelight didst peer;\nA kindly hostess waited, with a gentle face,\nTo join them for supper, and take their lonely place.\n\nBut when at last he came, his friend did say:\n\"Thy patience hath been lost; thy hunger doth decay;\nCome, eat with us, and let thy heart be light.\"\nAnd thus they dined upon sweetmeats, with mirth anew,\nTheir feast was ended swift, the day's long shadows flew.\n\nThe youth learned that night, in sorrow and regret,\nThat promptness were but folly; patience is best.\nFor though his hunger pangs didst cut like knife,\nHis hostess's warmth didst soothe his thirsty heart life.\n\nThus ended this fable, to teach us of virtue true:\nPatience waits the patient in all affairs anew.\nNow if thou wouldst decline my invitation to dine,\nAs I have done today, take heed: thy patience shall shine.",
