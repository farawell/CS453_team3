She typed out a reply, hoping Jack would get the message: \"Ugh, another one. Can't make it this evening. Traffic's a nightmare.\"\n\nJust then, her phone buzzed again with an invite from Jack. This time, he had included a few dodgy jokes to soften the blow: \"Hey, lighten up! No sense in stressing about things that are gonna be fine anyway.\"\n\nEmily rolled her eyes good-naturedly - she knew Jack wasn't trying to be cruel. But still, she felt a twinge of disappointment.\n\nAnd so, she ended up taking a few hours of overtime instead, barely making it home before the clock struck 10 PM.\n\nIn this draft, I've incorporated modern phrases and terminology into a story that still has a Shakespearean feel to it (via the use of contractions).",
