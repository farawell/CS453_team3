By night,\nI soar on eagle's wings, with armor bright,\nAnd vow to follow virtues' noble quest.\n\n(Suddenly, he is startled by the sound of horses' hooves)\nTHOMPSON:\nHark! What noise doth disturb my silent sleep?\nPrithee, good Sir Edward, bid thee kindly keep\nThy gentle voices from this troubled mind.\n\n(Sir Edward exits)\n\nTHOMPSON:\n( alone )\nAh, woe is me. Didst thou not tell the truth, dear master,\nThat I, a lowly squire, do toil and sweat\nFor honor's sake? Alas, my dreams are tainted bright\nBy worldly cares and doubts of power or wealth.",
