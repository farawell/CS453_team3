  "output": "**The Ballad of Folly's Shadow**\n\nIn days of yore, when honor stood tall,\nA noble heart did secretly enthrall\nTo forces that would bring downfall and woe,\nAnd in their grasp, the noble's soul bestowed.\n\n'Twixt [name] and [host], a bond of trust did form,\nBut cunning hands did plot each subtle norm.\nWith whispered words and hidden glance, they do conspire,\nAnd [name]'s heart, with heavy burden, did acquire.\n\nTheir schemes did blossom like a summer's night,\nWith promise of wealth and glory, shining bright.\nBut [host], deceived by [name]'s flattery's guile,\nDid see the truth, but too late, their trust did smile.\n\nNow [name], forsaken, doth wander alone,\nHis honor tarnished, his heart turned to stone.\nHe weeps for what is lost, and the love they shared,\nA bond of friendship broken, beyond repair.\n\nThus this tale tells, of folly's darkest night,\nWhen treachery doth creep, and love doth take flight.\n Beware, dear friends, of those who with deceit enthrall,\nFor in their shadows, loss doth silently call.\n\n[Your name]\nA bard, in sorrow, sing'st of woe and shame.",
