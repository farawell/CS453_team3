  "output": "Fair friend, thou seekest a description of the scene,\n\nWherein a prince, with heart beset by sorrows' sting,\nDidst find solace in that peaceful and serene clime.\n\n'Twas as he wandered through the garden's gates,\nA labyrinth of white flowers, softly swaying to fate;\nThe lilies, like sentinels of joy and love, didst stand,\nTheir cups of beauty blooming, with a tranquil shade.\n\nHe breathed the sweet perfume that wafted through the air,\nAs petals danced around him, with an ethereal snare;\nTheir pure and crystal fragrance brought to his sight,\nA symphony that calmed the tumults of his troubled night.\n\nThe sun, a ghostly galleon, sailed upon his brow,\nCasting no reflection in its silver glow below;\nYet the prince felt peace, like a dark rose within his breast,\nAs lilies wrapped their petals 'round him, and his sorrows' unrest.\n\nIn this fair garden, free from cares and troubles' weight,\nHe found his thoughts, like autumn leaves, were rent away;\nTheir fears and doubts didst wither, as the lily's strength didst show,\nAnd in that fleeting moment, he found solace to bestow.",
