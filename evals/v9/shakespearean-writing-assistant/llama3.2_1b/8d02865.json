  "output": "Fair sir, thou dost pose mine artful hand\nTo weave a tapestry of verse and scene.\n\n'Tis at morn, when dew doth gently lay\nUpon the grounds, as if to crown the day,\nThat I chanced upon this garden's might.\nA tranquil haven, bathed in silver light.\n\nThe flowers, like sentinels of greenance fair,\nDid stand, their beauty unaltered by the air.\nThou, lovely lily, with thy pure and snowy face,\nDidst steal my eye, a siren to a peaceful place.\n\nThe breeze, a whispered secret in mine ear,\nDid speak of peace and quiet, free from fear.\nIn thine ethereal beauty, I did find\nA respite from turmoil's tumultuous mind.\n\nAs I walked through the garden, bathed in sunlight clear,\nI felt my heart, like lilies, lifted and shed its tear.\nThe weight of crowns and duties, heavy as a chain,\nDid lift, as if release had fallen upon the plain.\n\nIn this sweet garden, where thou dost bloom so fair,\nI found solace from the trials that I bear.\nThy beauty, like a balm to my troubled soul,\nDid soothe my heart, and left me whole.\n\nThus in this tranquil spot, I rest from mine own care,\nAnd let my thoughts, like birds in lilies, scatter and share.",
