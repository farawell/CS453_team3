  "output": "Fair friend, thou seekest contemplation's hallowed shore\nTo mark the trials that beset thy soul once more?\n'Tis thus: In life's rugged labyrinth, we stray,\nWhere shadows dance and darkness doth ensnare our way.\nThe fiercest tempests rage, and waves of woe\nDo crash against our frail form, and oft do roll\n\nOur hearts, like autumn leaves, are torn asunder\nBy gusts of despair, that with wild force resound\nAnd as we journey on, amidst such bitter strife,\nWe find ourselves at crossroads, where choices come in life.\n\nSome roads do lead to solace, darkness and despair,\nYet still we choose the one that casts a troubled air\nFor in regret's cold grasp, we oft find thine own face\n Beside our own reflection, mirrored in a lonely place\n\nAnd so, dear friend, I balm thy wounded heart with cheer,\nIn whispers soft, as summer breezes whisper secrets clear.\nTo heal and mend the breaches of our wounded pride,\nLet us together hold each other's outstretched side.\n\n(Note: In this response, I've used words and phrases typical of Shakespearean writing. \"Thou seekest contemplation's hallowed shore\" is an example of metaphorical language. \"In life's rugged labyrinth\" describes the challenges we face as humans.)",
