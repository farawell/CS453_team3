  "output": "Fair patron, thou dost ask for a story anew,\nOf one who doth chase the whispers of the Lake's sweet hue.\n\nIn days of yore, when valorous knights would roam,\nTheir hearts afire with noble quests, they found their home.\nAmongst the forest depths, where reeds and rushes sway,\nA knight didst hear the ancient tales of a legendary way.\n\n'Twas said that Lady of the Lake, with magic's gentle might,\nDidst hold the secrets of the past, in her shimmering light.\nMany had attempted to find her, but none return'd alive,\nFor those who sought power and glory at her throne, didst start to thrive.\n\nThe knight, with determination burning bright as gold,\nDidst set forth on his journey, to prove his valor bold.\nThrough labyrinths of mist and moonlight's silver glow,\nHe rode, his steed beneath him steadfast, till the dawn began to grow.\n\nHis armor dented, worn, yet shining with a new-found might,\nThe knight didst venture forward, into the forest's darkest night.\nA thousand sounds didst assail his ears, as if the woods themselves\nDidst warn and whisper secrets, only he could hear.\n\nBut still he pressed on, undaunted by fear or doubt,\nFor in his heart, a fire burned, to prove his honor found.\nAt last, a glimmering light appeared, a beacon in the gloom,\nThe Lady of the Lake's chamber beckoned him, with secrets unbound.\n\n Inside, he found a pool of waters, calm and serene as night,\nA mirrored pool reflecting the stars, shining with a gentle delight.\nThe knight approached her throne, a crown on his noble head,\nAnd declared to the lake, \"I come in search of wisdom, rather than wealth or dead.\"\n\nLady of the Lake, with a gentle smile, didst listen and behold,\nThis knight's true intentions, as he sought the truth that all must unfold.\nShe spoke in ripples, soothing sounds within his heart,\n\"You seek not power, but wisdom. A noble quest, forever to part.\"",
