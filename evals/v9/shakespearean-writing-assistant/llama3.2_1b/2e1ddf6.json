  "output": "Fair sir or madam, thou dost pose a query most fair,\nA tale of adventure and fate, for thy heart's desire to share.\n\nIn days of yore, when chivalry's noble creed didst thrive,\nA knight most bold and valiant didst dare to strive.\n'Twas Sir Edward, stalwart and true of heart and sword,\nThat yearned to vanquish his own doubts and find the Lady's court.\n\nWith steed and armor shining bright as morning's dew,\nHe rode forth from village, where he had served many a day anew,\nThrough forest dark where whispers spread of eerie, witching might,\nAnd rivers wide where ancient secrets sang in endless night.\n\nHe packed a bedroll, bread, cheese, and waters for his passage fair,\nAnd set forth at dawn, seeking the Lady's mysterious lair.\nFor said she dwelt not 'neath mortal hills, nor by the stream so bright,\nBut deeper'd than realms of dreams, where waters flowed from mystic night.\n\nWith heart aflame with hope and valor unfeigned,\nSir Edward rode on, through mists that whispered truths unknown to gain.\nAt dusk he spotted ships upon a lake's still surface below,\nTheir lights like stars ascending from the darkness to bestow.\n\nThe Lady of the Lake, in beauty stern apart from gentle beam,\nInvited him ashore with magic whispers to make room for knightly dream.\n\"Come,\" she beckoned softly, as the forest birds took flight,\n\"I'll grant thee token: one gift of valor, thy name will echo through the night.\"\n\nA maiden's voice fair, with sorcery enchanting yet unclear,\nSummoned Sir Edward to follow closely through moonlight that doth appear.\nWith every step on rocky shores he faced untold fears and terrors' sway,\nYet heart afire with courage true, his spirit stood all unwary in disarray.\n\nUpon the lake's silent face a ring of shells did lie\nShining like tiny stars - four stones, inscribed to keep thine own reply.\n\"Who is thy knight, dear Lady?\" he asked, as he chose four and prayed them to tell,\nFor honor's sake, that name would echo on, as if 'neath thy lake's still spell.\n\nA hidden voice whispered: \"Thy heart shall wear it bright\nAs valor marks it true - the chosen one, without a single fight.\"\n\nWith those four stones thus chosen by silent voices of the night,\nSir Edward stood before yonder Lady, his heart beating with pure delight.\nHe took them in hand and knew that from this moment on would he be known as bold.",
