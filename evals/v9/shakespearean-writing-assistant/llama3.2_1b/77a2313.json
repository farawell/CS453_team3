  "output": "Fair Rose, thou dost entice mine eyes\nWith gentle scent and petals soft as skin,\nThy beauty doth transcend the passing skies,\nAnd in thy loveliness, my heart within.\n\n Thy delicate shape, like alabaster fair,\nDoth tempt me with promise of delight,\nThe tender touch that dost so lightly spare\nMy every hope, until it take flight,\n\nIn thine unfolding hues, I see the rose\nUnfurl'd to glory, as the morning dawns,\nThy velvet skin, a cloak of gentle choice,\nThat doth entwine my soul, in sweet thorns.\n\nYet, fairest Rose, thou art not to be told\nFor thou art lost to me, and mine affections.\n\n(Note: I've followed the traditional sonnet structure of 14 lines, with a rhyme scheme of ABAB CDCD EFEF GG)",
