She gazeth upon the FLOWERS)\n\nWONDERO:\nBy Jove, 'tis a strange affliction of mine,\nTo cherish memories that are now but ashes cold.\nYet soft, what light through yonder window breaks?\n'Tis love's remains, which still my heart doth ache.\n\n(As she speaks, her eyes fall upon a CUP or TWO, worn with age. She reaches forth and taketh them in her hands)\n\nWONDERO:\nA cup, thy beauty did I once behold,\nIn days of youth, when passions wild and free didst unfold.\nBut now, alas! 'Tis but a relic of love's warm fire,\nThat once didst burn within my breast like summer's desire.\n\n(Enter her LOVING COMPANION from yonder room)\n\nWONDERO:\nOh, gentle friend, thou dost behold the past,\nAnd with thee, memories that never shall pass.\nWhat say you to these tokens of love's sweet might?\nDoth't stir a fire within my heart's dark night?\n\nLOVING COMPANION:\nMy dear Wondero, thy eyes do shine so bright,\nAs if 'twere moonlight that the stars didst light.\nAh, fair one! Thou dost recall the joys we shared,\nThe laughter, tears, and whispers of our love unscarred.\n\nWONDERO:\nAy, gentle one, thou dost awaken memories old,\nThat bring me solace, though my heart doth grow cold.\nFor in these tokens, like a balm to soothe the pain,\nThou dost remind me of love's sweet refrain.\n\n(Exeunt)\n\nWONDERO: (sigheth)\nFarewell, dear Cup! Though thou art but old and grey,\nIn memory, thy beauty shall forever stay.\n\nACT II, SCENE I\n\n(We see our WONDERO, now seated on a couch, her eyes fixed upon some distant point)\n\nWONDERO:\nO, cruel fate, to cherish loves that are gone,\nYet in remembrance still my heart doth mourn.\nIn dreams, I relive the joy of yonder past,\nWhen sunshine danced within my home's warm glass.\n\n(Enter her daughter from yonder room, with a letter in hand)\n\nWONDERO:\nAh, daughter dear! Thy words have broken me\nWith tears that flow like summer's rain. What news brought thee?\n\nDAUGHTER:\nMy mother's heart doth break, for love lost long is done,\nAnd she doth recall the joy of yonder sun.\nShe speaks of Cup and of love that didst once burn bright.\n\nWONDERO:\nYet still she thinks, my child, that in remembrance lies\nA balm to soothe her pain. Shall I prevail with thee?\nPray tell me not thy mother's heart doth break?\n\nDAUGHTER:\nNot yet, dear mother...for though love lost seems gone,\nHope remains; some day thy daughter shall return.\n\nWONDERO:\nAh, blessed reunion! That sweet hope doth warm my breast!\nThy words revive the joy of yonder past, and I am whole\n\n(Exeunt)\n\nNote: The Shakespearean style, particularly the use of word choices, metaphors (such as \"memories that never shall pass\" or \"fire within my heart's dark night\") and phrasing with a touch of eloquence and poetry is included in this scene.",
