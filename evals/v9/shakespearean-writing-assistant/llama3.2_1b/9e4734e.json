'Tis an honor to assist thee in crafting scenes that doth capture the heart and soul of love, loss, and remembrance.\n\n**Scene: A Widow's Lament**\n\n(Enter WILLOW, a widow, sitting by a window, gazing out upon the passing seasons. She is surrounded by mementos of her past joys.)\n\nWILLOW:\n(by the gentle light that doth illume my chamber)\nO, cruel fate, why hast thou cruelly taken from me\nthe warmth of love and laughter? How I roam,\na widow, 'mongst memories of what once was mine.\n\n(Her eyes fall upon a faded rose, once pressed by her first lover. She smiles wistfully.)\n\nWILLOW:\nAlas, that fleeting flame hath gone out,\ndestroyed by time and fate's stern hand.\nYet still I hold the embers of that love,\nand with them, the memories of sweet repasts.\n\n(Her gaze shifts to a photo album, filled with pictures of her young family. Tears well up in her eyes.)\n\nWILLOW:\nAnd now, I find myself alone once more,\nwith naught but these tokens of what's been lost.\nMy children grown, their father absent and cold;\nmy husband long gone, leaving naught but gold.\n\n(Her voice cracks as she speaks of his passing.)\n\nWILLOW:\nHow oft hath grief for thee befell me?\nAs I do struggle to comprehend this new sea,\nwhere waves once calmed with gentle arms now roar,\nand I am left to navigate the dark some.\nShall I conceal myself in sorrow's dismal hold?\nOr shall I open my heart, and let the tears unfold?\n\n(Her eyes drift back to a statue of her late husband.)\n\nWILLOW:\nHis memory remains etched on marble stone,\na monument to love that once was mine to own.\nYet his absence leaves me desolate and bare.\nThe silence of his chamber is a heavy weight I bear.\n\n(Willow's reflection in the window becomes a blur as tears streaming down her cheek, she exclaims.)\n\nWILLOW:\nAh, cruel fate, how I do miss thee,\ntill thou hast gone, and left me weak.",
