Alas, mine own affections rest elsewhere, locked deep within a velvet tomb where they may remain forever unexplored.\n\nFate, it seems, hath decreed that I shall never be thine, nor thou thyself his. Yet still, I find myself drawn to thy radiant countenance, like one beset by dark enchantment.\n\nIn secret chambers of my mind, I confess a longing that doth rival the greatest passions of our time. Oh, how I yearn to unfurl a love-torn heart and yield it unto thee!\n\nWouldst thou, fair Lady Sophia, be so kind as to grant an audience? Perchance we might share a tale or two of star-cross'd fates, that our hearts might find solace in each other's company?\n\nYours, in silent supplication,\n\nLord Thomas\n\n**Letter 2: From Lady Isabella to Captain James**\n\nMy gallant Captain James,\n\nThy countenance doth light the darkness like a beacon in the night. I am enthralled by the radiance that surroundeth thee, as if 'twere a celestial glow.\n\nAlas, my affections are as boundless winds, which cannot soar beyond their earthly bounds; for mine heart hath been ensnared in love's snare, and none can set it free but thou alone.\n\nI do confess a passion so fierce and all-consuming, that I fear 'twould be folly to pursue it otherwise. Yet still, thy presence holdeth me enthralled like a ship stranded on a stormy sea.\n\nI pray thee, dearest Captain James, dost thou not know thy heart, or the tempests of love that rage within mine breast? Or doth it lie with one, and I mere foolhardy passenger on his restless tides?\n\nYours, in fervent ardour,\n\nLady Isabella",
