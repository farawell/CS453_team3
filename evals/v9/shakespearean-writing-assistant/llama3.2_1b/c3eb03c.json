I know not what I say!\nMy lips, they move to utter treason, yet some part of me doth stay\nTo hide from thee, dear friend, thy gaze, nay, 'tis thou that sees\nMine own naked truth, like candid sunbeams through the trees.\n\nForgive mine assent, for I am but a willing pawn.\nTake this my token, borne upon the winged hour's breath,\nA single coin of friendship, lost within mortal thrall.\nThus endeth part of our entwined cord and mystic pact born.\n\nThy faithful friend in riddles,\n[Whispers, then dashes to conceal his hand]",
