Fie upon it, say I!\n\nA thousand birds doth sing their sweet melodies to distract thee from the truth: \"the rose, not once nor twice, but thrice hath bloomed with beauty's might\". O, fairest guest! Why dost thou entreat me thus? Doth thy heart betray its allegiance?\n\nThe scent of rose petals on thy breath doth wafteth a promise divine. Yet I, a humble scribe, do discern the subtle whispers that thy words do utter: \"the secret's hidden in plain sight\", like so many riddles. Alas!\n\nIn this fleeting hour of fate, where shadows dance upon the wall, thou dost request my presence at thine feast-like assembly. Fear not, fair sir! For I shall play the part of fool to distract thee long enough that the truth doth remain concealed.\n\nYours in jest,\nA humble supplicant",
