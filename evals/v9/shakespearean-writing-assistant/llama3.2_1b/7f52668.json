  "output": "O, wicked friendship, thou that doth entwine\nMy heart with threads of golden loyalty,\nHow easily thou dost betray and leave\nThe tender shoots of trust to winter's gale.\n\nThy whispers, sweet and deceitful as summer's kiss,\nHath led me hither to this darkest night,\nWhen all thy warmth and kindness seemed to bless.\nBut now, alack! I see the fault in thine\n\nO, cruel fate, that doth afflict me thus!\nTo suffer loss of dear affections' fire,\nAnd so, in secret sorrow, I must rush\nTo leave thy bosom, and a tear to quench.\n\nHast thou forgot, or didst I but mistake?\nThy zeal for me, or was't just some ill wind that doth\nSweep through our quiet streets? Forgive my spite,\nAnd know'st thou that in this pain I see a truth.\n\nFor when the fire of friendship burns so bright,\nI thought thy love and loyalty were plain in sight;\nBut now, 'tis but a fleeting, foolish gleam.\nAh! O, how oft I've deceived myself on thee!\n\nYet still, I know not if my anger flows\nSo strong as mine disdain; for to thy kindness\nAnd trust I never gave. But nay, I'll swear:\nFrom henceforth, we shall part, and be no more.\n\nThus ends this soliloquy of a heart laid low,\nBy secrets kept and vows betrayed long ago...\n\n(Note: The tone of this soliloquy is one of hurt, anger, disappointment and sadness. It reflects the emotions of betrayal experienced by a character who feels their friendship has been broken.)",
