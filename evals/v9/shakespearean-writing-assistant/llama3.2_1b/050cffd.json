  "output": "Fair seeker of truth and contemplation's creed,\nWhat is't that doth stir within thy bosom cold?\nShall I, a humble monk, abandon all,\nAnd follow thou the path that leads to joy untold?\n\nMethinks 'tis written in great books of old,\nThe Scriptures, whereon wisdom is revealed to unfold.\nYet oftentimes, like a cryptic riddle, they doth pass\nBefore mine eyes, with words that cause my soul to dash.\n\nAmidst the whispers of a quiet night,\nI hear naught but doubts and troubled fright.\nWhat shadows creep within my chambered breast?\nDo faith's soft beams not illume the darkest unrest?\n\nO woe is me! My heart, a tempest-tossed sea,\nDoth toss with fears that none can calm by thee.\nYet still I tread the narrow path of doubt,\nAnd pray that gentle lightlessness may find its rout.\n\nAh, Faith, thou art a flame that shines in darkest night,\nA guiding star, that doth illume the troubled plight.\nBut dost thou truly hold this power to deliver me?\nOr am I but a feeble heart that's lost in thee?\n\n(Sighs) O, noble Spirit! What wilt thou have me know?\nShall I surrender all to thee, or shall I hold fast what's mine?",
