Fie upon this strife!\nThy nation's peace, thy people's love, are lost to thee,\nAs if the very gods did mock at thee.\n\nKING: (with heavy heart) Alas, fair maidens, I am old.\nMy youth and strength, like war's cold flame, doth grow cold.\n'Tis true, some still rage in foreign courts:\nYet shall they peace be lost, like autumn's faded role.\n\nLADY SECOND: Art thou not wiser than to yield thy hand?\nFor in this conflagration, many a life is planned\nTo be given up as sacrifices of war's dark land.\nWhat fruit is't that garners victory and fame?\n\nKING: (with sorrow) Ay, I have lived wars' bitter taste:\nAnd seen the destruction, with naught but pain at last.\nMy children weep, my friends do mourn, as in a shroud,\nTheir innocence lost to blood and slaughter's craft.\n\nLADY THIRD: Yet still we are invited forth from war-room\nTo courtly feasts, whereon our joy is spent.\nO, woe is us! As if the very fate didst smile\nUpon this hostilities, and in each passing night,\nA thousand reasons gave to rouse our cruel guile.\n\n(Exeunt, as THREE WISE WOMEN)\n\nLADY FIRST: Behold, fair king, that futility which doth creep?\nAnd see, alas! How nobility's virtues fade\n\nKING: (with tears) Indeed I weep, fair maidens! For to be\nIn endless clash and strife, a woeful fate is be\nFor ever hence, my honor shines no more.\n\n(Exeunt)",
