Here are two possible options, written in the grand style of the Bard himself:\n\n1. \"Hark, what mortal life doth pass, but memories stay,\nOf tail that wag'd and eyes that bright,\nThy loving presence here to stay.\nWith every morsel we did eat,\nA little piece of love was sweet.\"\n\n2. \"'Tis not the years, my dearest friend,\nThat shorten life, nor time's passing speed;\n' Tis our good fortune that doth offend\nThe fleeting hours that make it deed.\n\nThus let us cherish each dear day,\nLest future regrets we must convey.\nWith heartfelt thanks and love, I bid thee farewell,\nThy loyal hound, thy faithful self.\"\n\nMayhap one of these epitaphs shall capture the essence of thy beloved pet's spirit?",
