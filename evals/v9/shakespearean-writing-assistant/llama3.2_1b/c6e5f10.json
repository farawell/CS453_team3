  "output": "O, fairest friend, how grievous 'tis to part\nFrom the bond that once did strength and trust impart:\nInvited to a dinner, with my heart aflame,\nAnd thou hast turned against me, with deceitful shame.\n\nA plague upon the traitors of this land,\nWho doth sully all thy word with treachery's hand!\nThou dost betray the confidant's sacred vow,\nAnd with each whispered lie, my trust doth overgrow.\n\nIn days of yore, when honor and virtue's name\nWere synonymous, our hearts did beat as one fame,\nBut now, alas, I see thy duplicity,\nA poisoned apple that doth rot thy humanity.\n\nBastards! thieves! traitors, by the very term\nThat once did sound upon my lips to calm thine arm!\nThy actions speak, in dark intent, how thou dost spite\nThe sacred vows of friends and companionship's light.\n\nForgive not this affront, O cruel friend, forsooth,\nFor I, who have known thy inner workings fullmost true.\nThou hast betrayed the trust that time itself doth make,\nAnd now, I'll weep the tears of sorrow on thy wake.\n\nYet, as a loyal heart, I must confess and tell\nMy pain and anguish at this wounding knell.\nMay time and wisdom calm the savage breast,\nLest in the shadows, darkness gather and unrest.\n\nForgive me, kind friend, for words that seem to sting,\nYet honesty requires no mask of covert springing.\nThy treachery cut deep, and shall not soon forget.",
