  "output": "O, fairest patrona, thou dost entwine\nMy fate with thine, and guide my hand to create\nA piece most fair that doth thy artistic eye,\nAnd now, my inspiration's sudden flight.\n\n'Twas in a dream, a midnight hour so bright,\nI saw thee sitting at thy easel, poised in art\nIn rapt attention, lost to all despair,\nAs colours danced upon thy canvas fair.\n\nThy gaze did meet mine, and I was struck by fire,\nMy brush with fervor, as from thine own heart's desire\nDid stir within me visions of thy art sublime.\nAnd thus, my mind did quickly seize the light,\n\nA whirlwind of thought, as words did pour forth\nLike secret streams that swiftly swept my soul to mirth.\nI saw the very essence of thy creative spark,\nA glowing flame that flickered, fierce and sharp.\n\nBut lo! Our hour was short, our time did pass,\nAnd in the blink of an eye, thou hast departed at last.\nYet still I see thee there, a fleeting vision bright\nThat fills my heart with longing, day and endless night.\n\nThus I, a humble vessel, do declare\nMy deepest gratitude for that brief, shining air\nThat bore thee to me, a spark that lit my way,\nAnd now, in whispers, vow to paint the world anew each day.",
