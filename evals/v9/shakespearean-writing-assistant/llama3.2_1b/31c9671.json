Here's a poetic offering to express the yearning:\n\n\"O, for the sweet release from bondage's thrall,\nWhere chains that bound my heart do loudly fall!\nA prisoner of fate, I wander wide,\nLonging to break away from life's wild tide.\n\nMethinks 'tis cruelty, the pangs of pain\nThat in my breast do stir with restless strain.\nFor freedom's call, I've heard afar and sound\nThe siren song that beckons me to be unbound.\n\nBut time, impatient as the summer sun,\nDoth mock my yearning, hath not yet begun\nTo grant me liberty. Alas, forlorn!\nYet still my heart doth beat with fervent scorn\n\nFor chains that bind me, though they bring no rest.\nO, for the freedom of immortal thought!\"\n- (a soul in chains)",
