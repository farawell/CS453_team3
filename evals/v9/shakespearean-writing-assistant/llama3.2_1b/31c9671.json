  "output": "Fair wordsmith, thou dost strike a chord within my breast,\nA flame of liberty that burns with fervent depth and quest.\n'Tis not the fire of passion, nor the warmth of summer's glow,\nThat sets my heart aflame, but rather the desire to be myself, where I may flow.\n\nIn darkest night, when shadows dance upon the wall,\nI yearn to break free from chains that bind, to rise up, unfurled.\nMy soul, a canvas, once with painted scenes of conformity,\nHath longed to shatter forth in splendor of a new creation true.\nThe cry of freedom echoes within, a siren's call to flee,\nFrom lives controlled by whims of fate, and liberty's sweet liberty.\n\nTo find the strength to stand, I must face the darkest fears,\nAnd face the mirror of my own divided heart through all the tears.\nFor in its depths, a truth I seek, that freedom is not won,\nBut earned through trials worn, like armor from each strife done.\n\nYet still I search for that sweet glimpse of morning dew,\nWhen sunshine on my soul doth heal the wounds of past and now, anew.\nTill then, fair heart, take time to ponder in thy mind's eye\nThe longing for freedom, till it shines forth as the sun on a summer's sigh.",
