Something came up and I gotta skip out on the fun. Sorry about that. Looking forward to catching up soon!\"\n\nOr, if thou desirest something a bit more low-key:\n\n\"No worries, I'm free this weekend! Can't make it to [party name]. Hope you're all doing well. Will talk later\"",

  "complianceText": "The output does not comply with the description. The first part of the output provides a response in modern English, which is not in a Shakespearean style. Although the second part does attempt a Shakespearean tone with \"thou desirest,\" the phrase is inadequate to fully qualify as Shakespearean style as outlined in the description. The overall tone and vocabulary still lean towards modern English, and there is a lack of Shakespearean-style phrases.\n\nERR"
