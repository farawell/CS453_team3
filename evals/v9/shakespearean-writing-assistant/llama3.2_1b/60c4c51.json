  "output": "Fair patron, thou seekest a form most true,\nFor oath of allegiance 'twixt thee and thy crew?\nA pledge of loyalty, that doth endure\nThrough test of time, and troubles' heavy thunder.\n\nHere's proposed design for thy noble mind,\n\nARTICLE THE FIRST: Oaths of Supremacy\n\n1. I do vow and solemnly declare,\nThat to my lord, by virtue of our bond of care,\nI shall stand by him, through thick and thin, through strife\nAnd faithful service, from dawn till endless life.\n\n2. Thou shalt be first in all things that come,\nMy loyalty, a virtue, unyielding and serene.\nAgainst his foes, thou shalt take thy noble part,\nReady to serve, with courage in the heart.\n\nARTICLE THE SECOND: Oaths of Devotion\n\n1. I swear by my honor, true as can be,\nThat thou shalt reign benevolent, and justice decree\nWith wisdom guiding thee, through trial's darkest night.\nThy people shall thrive, in peace, and prosperity's light.\n\n2. My lord, when times grow dark, and troubles near,\nI vow to keep his counsel, calm and clear.\nThe weights of duty bearing heavily on my soul,\nHeavenward turning me, lest the load overwhelm.\n\nARTICLE THE THIRD: Oaths of Humility\n\n1. I pledge myself to thy good, a humble heart\nThat freely yields its wealth, with loyalty's sweet part.\nTo know thee just, and serve with willing might,\nThou shalt be dearer in my mind, than all this land's delight.\n\n2. When errors come, and mistakes I make\nI vow to learn from my faults, and take the king's decree\nA servant's humility, that doth not aspire\nTo claim dominance, but instead strive to serve with care\n\nThus written these oaths of loyalty in our own style,\nMay they endure as landmarks, against all fate's trial.",
