How little dost thou know\nThe joys that time shall bring to mortal thine.\nShall we not chase the shadows from our door?\nAnd dance in moonlight with love's sweet snare?\n\nBut I, thy faithful Sun, must make my flight.\nIn seventeen licks, my journey ends at night. 'Tis right.\n\nYet still thou dost thy beauty show,\nAnd in one hour, mortal men shall know\nThe magic of thy golden light, so bright,\nAs sun and day do blend in heavenly sight.\n\nFarewell, dear Day! May thy eclipse be brief.\nThy love for me, I now foreknow in birth.\nAnd when my burning coals begin to red,\nA new dawn'll rise, and thou shalt be nigh.",
