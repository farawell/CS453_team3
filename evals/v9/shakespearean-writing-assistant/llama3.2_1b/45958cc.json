Alas, I must confess that my haste doth beset me, and I fear I have but a moment's space to respond.\n\nMethinks, upon perusing the script above thy hand, \"Regretfully, I must decline thy invitation.\" Marry, what a candid phrase! Thou dost show thy true self, a man of candor and heart. My own experience doth echo these thoughts - when was I last invited to dinner, and didst thou accept? Nay, my stomach doth protest at the mere thought.\n\nVerily, the day before yesterday hath witnessed a most ardent conversation 'twixt us, in which our interests and passions were set aflame. I hast spoken of lost loves and unforgotten dreams; thou hast shared with me thy own tale of woe and resilience. Ah, dear hostess, what sorcery is this that binds us together? Our souls do dance beneath a ceiling not yet designed.\n\nForgive my digressiveness, but prithee, tell me more of the evening's pleasures! What delightful foods shall we partake in? Which songs shall we sing and laugh along with? In short, I covet to know the secrets hidden behind those benevolent words. But fear not, for in my haste, I hath forgot myself entirely.\n\nOh, blessed day! What wondrous coincidences 'twould bring these two souls together! Didst thou receive a letter or missive from afar, inviting us both to join hands and lips? Ah, but 'tis too late now - we stand here, sans entourage and without a clue as to how this unlikely convergence came about. Alas for that poor dinner party!\n\nForgive me, dear hostess, for I seem to find myself ensnared in idle chatter, a mad tangle of thoughts and words never meant to be joined. Fie upon it! I shall try again with greater haste - for if thou wouldst but condescend to share thy true intentions once more, all shall become clear as if by moonlight.\n\nPrithee, sayest thou enjoy the evening thus far, in company of friends and delights? Or dost thou desire some private moment with me, just that we might converse free from prying eyes?",
