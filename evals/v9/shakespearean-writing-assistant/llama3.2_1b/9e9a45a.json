Pray tell, what possessed thee so?\n\nEmily: (laughs) Nah, I just got lazy that day. Can't make up for an old plan, right?\n\nSarah: Ah, but thou see, our plans were forged in haste, without a full night to ponder how we'd spend our evening.\n\nEmily: Exactly! Which means you're making it way too hard to please me.\n\nSarah: Thou canst never be sure what tides my fancy doth hold.\n\nEmily: (chuckles) That's why I'm glad you said no and now a fresh plan can unfold like springtime.\n\nSarah: Indeed, but alas, 'tis not so easily made as summer's warmth or autumn's breeze. Can't just conjure something new willy-nilly!\n\nEmily: Maybe some other time we can tweak the old plans, re-imagine them anew, and see if thou dost feel more at ease.\n\nSarah: Oh? And when that day comes, I promise to be more thoughtful in my words, as well as my gestures.",
