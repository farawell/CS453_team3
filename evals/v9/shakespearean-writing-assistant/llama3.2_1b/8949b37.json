  "output": "Fair sirs and madams of the realm, gather 'round and heed my tale,\nOf days that dawned anew upon our ancient kingdom's hall.\nA time of change, of progress, did this moment bring,\nWhen empires rose, and greatness took its mighty wing.\n\n'Twas in a land of dusty plains and desert sands so bright,\nWhere pharaohs once held sway, and pyramids pierced the light.\nOur land was home to mighty tribes, with cultures vast and old,\nBut as the farsighted king didst gaze upon his empire's gold.\n\nOne fateful eve, when stars began their whispered song,\nA vision dawned upon him: a time for grandeur to be wronged,\nNot by the hand of conquest, but by reason's guiding light,\nTo establish a new era, where all could thrive in peace and right.\n\nWith secret councils shrouded 'neath hoodwink'd whispers low,\nThe wise men convened to devise a plan, as wisdom didst bestow.\nTheir words, like autumn breezes carried on the wind's sweet sighs,\nDidst weave a tapestry of hope, where once despair didst lie.\n\nThen forth from yonder land arose a maiden fair and bright,\nAn oracle, with visions to reveal th' ancient kingdom's plight.\nWith gift of prophecy, she spake words of truth divine,\nThat shook the foundations of our times, in a resounding chime.\n\n\"Hearken, oh wise ones!\" she said, \"the time of change doth draw near,\"\n\"A new era dawns, where virtue shall be king rather than fear.\"\nFor 'tis not power that shall ascend to highest throne,\nBut wisdom, justice, and compassion, which in hearts are sown.\n\nThenceforth our land didst rise, a beacon bright in the West,\nAs people's love for freedom, liberty's sacred nest,\nDidst take its place amongst the realm of nations proud and new,\nAnd though our path hadst long journey'd far to get into view,\n\nYet now we stand poised upon this milestone day,\nWhere ancient kingdoms turned with modern era's way.",
