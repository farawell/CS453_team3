  "output": "Fair slumberer, thou dost entice mine eyes\nTo gaze upon the realm of fancy's might,\nWhere vivid visions dance and softly sighs\nThe whispers of our soul's deepest night.\n\nIn this mystical world, thy mind doth roam\nAnd chases phantasms that fleeting thought\nDo bring forth in their wake a hollow home\nWhere anxieties and fears are caught\n\nBut soft! The stars above do twinkle bright\nAs if to guide thee through the winding way\nOf dreams, that labyrinthine and endless night\nThat beckons thee to follow thy heart's sway.\n\nYet, though we may not fully understand\nThe mysteries of this dreamworld to hand,\nWe find solace in its wondrous brand.",
