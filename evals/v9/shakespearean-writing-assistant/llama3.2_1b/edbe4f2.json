  "output": "O, fairest fields of green, that thou dost lie barren still,\nWhere sunbeams dance and night's dark shadows softly fill,\nI wander here, a lone and solitary man,\nA herder, lost in thought, with nary friend to gain.\n\nThe shepherd's cloak, that once did proudly wave,\nNow hangs in tatters, bare of festive sway,\nAs I my flocks do tend, with no gentle hand\nTo soothe their whispers, or to calm their wandering stand.\n\nOh, how thy fields, O Nature, dost entice me still!\nWith hidden streams and sweet perfume, they thrill\nMy heart and senses, in a deep, sad kiss,\nYet thou, alas! Art not there to share the bliss.\n\nIn distant towns and villages, I do hear\nNo murmurs of cheer, nor kindness that doth peer,\nUpon my face, with hospitality sincere;\nBut here, no welcome banners wave, nor gentle peerings clear.\n\nThus for thy joy and warmth, I long to roam, I know,\nThis solitary path, where shadows lie below.\nO, fairest field, would thou be kinder, grant me might\nTo join the circle of friends, who gather through the night.",
