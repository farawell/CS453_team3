  "output": "O, fairest vales where thou dost roam and reign,\nA solitary soul, I wander, lost in pain.\nThe sun doth shine on thy green meadow floor,\nYet none doth visit thee, nor hear thy gentle voice once more.\n\nMy flock, they gather 'neath the trees above,\nA hushed and peaceful crowd, without a gentle love;\nTheir moos, a melancholy dirge, that echoes through\nThe empty spaces, where thou dost wander, alone anew.\n\nOh, wouldst thou join me in this endless plight,\nAnd with thy presence, end the dark of night?\nBut alas, thou must not know my secret sighs,\nNor bear witness to my lonely, endless cries.\n\nYet still I hope that thou, dear shepherd, art awake,\nWaking to a dawn, when love might make amends for naught we'd leave;\nPerhaps 'tis in thy heart, where kindness doth lie deep,\nThat thou shalt see me here, and love shall not remain asleep.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output clearly adheres to the Shakespearean style of writing as described. The language incorporates words typical of Shakespearean English, such as \"thou,\" \"dost,\" \"doth,\" \"wouldst,\" and \"alas,\" which are directly compliant with the description's expectation of \"Shakespearean style\" using specific words like \"thou\" and \"hath.\" Furthermore, the thematic and lyrical nature, along with the structure of the lines, closely resemble the examples of Shakespeare's style provided in the description. The overall tone is poetic and utilizes a similar cadence and figurative language akin to that found in the works of Shakespeare. \n\nNo violation.\n\nOK"
