What hast thou made me know?\nThat all thy love, fair Amor, is but a memory to show?\n\n**(Verse 3)**\nThe wind doth whisper secrets in mine ear\nOf whispers 'gainst the dawn, of shadows drawing near\nI pray thee, Amor, grant thy servant peace\nLest I, like autumn leaves, be crushed beneath thy ceaseless release\n\n**(Chorus)**\nO, Amor, thou art Ereusis, lost to me\nA void that gapes with every fleeting breeze\nMy heart, a vessel once filled with thine own fire\nNow doth lie drained, a mere, forlorn desire\n\n**Note:** I've used words and phrases from Shakespeare's vocabulary to create a sense of longing and despair in the song. The musical notation is not included as it's a text-based format.",
