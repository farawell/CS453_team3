  "output": "Hark, little one, with slumber fraught so deep,\nWhy toss thy tiny limbs and wakeful weep?\nA restless night doth steal the gentle sleep,\nAnd shadows dance where dreams should safely creep.\n\nFear not, my child, nor let thy heart be weighed,\nFor I am here to calm the thoughts arrayed.\nClose thine eyelids soft, like petals gently swayed,\nAs slumber's arms thee in their embrace have laid.\n\nThe moon doth shine upon the silent land,\nAnd stars do twinkle, a celestial band.\nLet not thy worries grip thy little hand,\nBut drift away to dreams of silver sand.\n\nHush now, sweet babe, and rest your weary head,\nA gentle lullaby my words will thread.\nForget your troubles, fears now gently shed,\nAnd in the arms of sleep, find peace instead. \n\n\n\n",
