A melody of shadowed rhyme,\n\nA tale spun 'neath the veil of time,\n\nWhere whispers dance on frosted pane,\nAnd secrets breathe a spectral strain.\n\n\nThe raven's call upon the breeze,\n\nThrough tangled boughs and silver trees,\n\nA crescent moon doth gently gleam,\n\nReflecting dreams within a dream.\n\nBut naught is told, nor path appears,\nOnly silence drowns the waiting ears. \n\n\n\nLet fancy spin its web of might,\nAnd pierce the darkness with its light.\n\n\n\n",
