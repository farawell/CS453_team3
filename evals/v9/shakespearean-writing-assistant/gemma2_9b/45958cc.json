'Tis of a humble baker who dreamt he was crowned king, and when he awoke, he proclaimed himself ruler over all the loaves and pastries within his bakery! Alas, 'twas but a fleeting moment of grandeur, like a summer's day that melts away with haste. But hark! Where were we? Ah yes, the sun... A mighty force it be, turning the seasons, shaping the tides, influencing the very hearts of men!  And yet, I find myself pondering on... what are those strange creatures that scurry across the floorboards? Are they gnomes perchance, or mischievous sprites frolicking in the shadows? No matter, for all these things are but fleeting fancies, like the wisps of smoke that vanish upon the breeze. \n\n\n\n",
