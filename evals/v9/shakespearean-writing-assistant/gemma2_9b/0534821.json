A maiden, ELISABETH, sits upon a wooden bench, idly gazing towards the horizon. \n\n\n**(Enter Elisabeth)**\n\n**ELISABETH (To herself):**\nThe sun hath set, and yet he tarries still.\nIs war a cruel mistress, that holds him fast? \nEach passing hour doth chip away my will,\nLeaving me weary with this hope that lasts. \n\nHe promised me a rose, as red as fire,\nWhen he returned from battle's bloody ground.\nA promise whispered loud in love's desire,\nA sound I now recall, without a sound.\n\n**(Elisabeth rises and begins to pace)**\n\n\nMy heart doth ache with fear, yet still it yearns, \nFor his return, his touch upon my skin.\nDo angels watch him, as the journey burns?\nDoes heaven listen when I pray within?\n\nOh, love! Where art thou now? Come back to me,\nAnd end this waiting, filled with restless glee.\n\n\n**(Elisabeth collapses onto the bench, her head in her hands)**\n\n\n\n\n",
