  "output": "Hark, fair user,\n\nA tale I shall weave of realms long past,\nWhere shadows dance and memory doth fade fast. 'Twas Avalon, they called it, blessed and fair, \nAn isle of perpetual spring, beyond compare. \n\nThere, nymphs with laughter light as summer breeze,\nDanced 'midst flowers blooming 'neath ancient trees.\nThe very air did shimmer with enchantment's spell,\nWhere mortals once lived, stories whispered fell.\n\nBut time, a cruel thief, stole Avalon's might,\nForgotten by the world, sunk into endless night. \nSome say a curse it bore, brought on by pride, \nOthers whisper of dragons, wings of darkest tide.\n\nNow, naught remains but echoes in the breeze,\nA tapestry of dreams, veiled 'neath ancient seas.\nYet, if thou listen close, upon a starlit eve,\nThou mightst hear melodies from Avalon's heart still weave.\n\n\n",
