A caged bird doth sing its mournful plea, \nIts heart, it yearns to soar beyond the walls,\nTo taste the wind and touch the boundless free, \nYet chains of duty bind its feathered sprawls.  \n\nOh, cruel fate, that shackles such a soul!\nTo dream of skies unseen, yet never fly!\nThis restless spirit aches for its whole goal,\nAnd yearns to break from burdens held so nigh.\n\n\n\nLet me know  if thou wisheth another verse, or perchance a sonnet on the matter! \n",
