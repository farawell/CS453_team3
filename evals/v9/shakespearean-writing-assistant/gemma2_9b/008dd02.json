A thousand tapestries hang from these walls, yet none can mask the chill that creeps within my heart. My kingdom prospers, true, fields abound with bounty, and ships return laden with treasure untold. Yet is this all? Can silks and spice truly nourish a soul weighed down by endless cares?*\n\n*(She turns away from the mirror, looking out at her court below.) \n\n*I see them there, my subjects, bustling like ants beneath me. Each demanding their share, each seeking favor in this game of royal chess. But who sees *me*? Who knows the burdens that I bear, the fear that gnaws, the loneliness that sits like a shadow ever at my side?*\n\n*(She reaches out to the cold stone wall, as if seeking comfort from its unfeeling surface.) \n\n*To rule is no mere game of vanity, though the world doth perceive it so. It is a tapestry woven with threads of blood and sorrow, laced with joy and triumph. But oh, how fickle fortune can be! To build an empire only to watch it crumble, to raise champions only to see them fallâ€¦ Such is the cruel dance of life, and I, but a puppet dancing in its grasp.*\n\n\n",
