I see thee, knaves, who wrought \n          My end most foul, my life distraught! \n          Ye thought me naught but wind and dust,\n          But now I haunt ye, grimly just!\n\n**BRAVE THOMAS (trembling): **   She speaks! 'Tis Anna's Shade! But how? She's-- gone.\n                                    We laid her to rest, beneath the stone.\n\n**GHOSTLY ANNA:**     Beneath the stone? A hollow jest! \n                 My soul still burns, a vengeful crest!\n                 Ye stole my wealth, ye cast me down,\n       With lying words and smiles that crown'd \n       A serpent's heart, devoid of grace. \n\n**SNEERING RICHARD (shrugging):**   She spins tales now 'a hauntin' night.\n         Her fury fades, her spectral light\n          Will dim and vanish soon enough.\n\n**GHOSTLY ANNA:**    Silence! Ye tremble at my gaze? \n              The darkness bears me, through these days!\n              With icy breath and chilling touch,\n              I'll hound your steps, 'til vengeance much...\n\n*Anna raises a transparent hand, swirling mists gather around them.*\n\n\n **BRAVE THOMAS (terrified):**   Lord Richard, flee! It touches us!\n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like this scene to continue! ðŸŽ­ ðŸ’€",
