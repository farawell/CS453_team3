A tempest rages 'ithin my soul,\nA war betwixt the spirit and the flesh,\nWhere once was certainty, now doubt doth toll,\nAnd hollow echoes plague my sacred thresh.\n\nI vowed to God, to serve with heart and hand,\nTo cast aside the world's alluring call,\nYet shadows creep, across this barren land,\nWhispering tales that shake my faith's frail wall.\n\nDo angels watch us from yon starry sphere,\nOr are they but illusions in the night?\nDo prayers ascend, or merely fall, unclear?\nOh, torment me these thoughts with all their might!\n\nI search for solace in the scriptures old,\nBut now their words seem cryptic, cold, untamed.\nIs truth a whisper lost, a tale untold?\nBy doubt's sharp blade, my spirit is defamed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
