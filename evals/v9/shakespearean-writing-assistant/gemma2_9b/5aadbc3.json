  "output": "A merry jest he weaves with wit so bright,\nHis jingles fill the court with joyous light.\nYet 'neath the motley, deep within his soul,\nHe yearns for power, a royal goal.\n\nFor when he sees the crown upon its stand,\nAnd feels the weight within his lordly hand,\nA silent wish, unspoken yet sincere,\nTo trade his fools' cap for a king's attire clear. \n\n\n",
