Let us speak of Sir Gareth bold, renowned throughout the land,\n\nAnd Pegasus, his steed of purest white, forever at his hand.\n\nFrom sire to son they shared their bond, a kinship deep and true,\n\nThrough sunlit fields and shadowed wood, adventures ever new. \n\nGareth, upon that coat of mail, would whisper tales untold,\nOf battles won and dragons slain, with Pegasus as bold.\n\nHis ears would perk, his eyes would gleam, reflecting Gareth's spark,\n\nAnd through the valleys thick and green, they'd leave their trusty mark. \n\nWhen danger loomed, with fearsome might, Pegasus would charge ahead,\nA shield of steel, a wall of white, for Gareth bravely led.\n\nSo intertwined their destinies, that 'pon the field of war,  \n\nBoth knight and steed stood side by side, united evermore.\n\n\n",
