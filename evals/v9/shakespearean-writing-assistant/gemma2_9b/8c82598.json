I flit in sunlit days, a fleeting show; while thou dost stand, year after year, the same.”\n\nThe Oak, with wisdom born of ages told, replied, \"Fair bird, thy wings may fly through summer’s grace, but mine roots delve deep, and shape this earthly space. I yield not fruit without the patient sun, nor stand in height before my time is run.\"\n\n\n\"Though clouds of doubt may shroud thee 'midst thy quest,\" \nThe Oak did say, \"and winds may steal thy rest,  \nRemember well, dear sparrow, that true might comes from waiting, and embracing light.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe sparrow pondered this, then took to wing, a lesson learned on air so swiftly flung.\n\nThus doth patience hold a virtue strong, like roots that anchor us, where we belong! \n\n\n",
