Listen well, for I shall weave a tale most bold,\n\nOf Sir Gareth, a knight whose courage oft did unfold. \nHe yearned with passion true, for the Lady of the Lake,\nWhose beauty was legend, and heart both pure and spake. \n\n\nUpon his loyal steed, he rode through forest deep,\nWhere shadows danc'd and mystery in silence did sleep.\nHe braved the dangers lurking, each beast and goblin vile,\nHis blade a beacon gleaming, with honor as his style.\n\nPast mountains craggy stood 'twas said she made her bower, \nOn mists ethereal bathed, a vision of great power.\nSir Gareth sought her counsel, wise beyond compare,\nTo save his kingdom stricken, by darkness and despair.\n\nBut guarding the water's edge, where silver lilies bloom, \nHe faced a fearsome dragon, its scales like twilight gloom.\nWith valor undimmed he fought, 'til fire met steadfast steel,\nAnd silence fell upon the lake, where echoes could not peel.\n\nThus Gareth proved his worthiness, with courage and true heart,\nThe Lady of the Lake appeared, a tear did gently start.\nIn gentle voice she spoke to him, of prophecies foretold, \nAnd bestowed a gift divine, before her tale was told.\n\n\n\nYet what that gift may be, or fate's mysterious hand,\nWill wait for another tale, upon this enchanted strand.\n\n\n\n\n",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output demonstrates a narrative style that aligns with the Shakespearean style of writing. It includes language that evokes a classical, poetic tone, fitting within the realm of Shakespearean-themed storytelling. The use of words like \"hark\", \"danc'd\", \"twas\", and \"valor\" creates an older, more formal English feel reminiscent of Shakespearean times. Furthermore, the narrative's structure and rhythm contribute to the stylistic match, weaving a tale of knights, quests, and mythical beings, which are common themes in Shakespearean and Elizabethan literature. Therefore, this output adheres to the requirements of using a Shakespearean style to tell a story.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
