Silence now thy weary plea!\nI am no knave nor fiend, for all to see.\nThese deeds I do are for a greater good,\nA tapestry of power, understood?\n\n**Conscience:**\n\nVillain, thy heart doth beat a foul refrain,\nA rhythm dark and fueled by wicked gain. \nThe souls thou cravest, twisted in despair,\nAre shackles forged upon this poisoned air.\n\n**Villain:**\n\nBe hushed! Thy whispers are but hollow sound,\nA fragile voice that doth no power bind.\nMy will is ironclad, my purpose true,\nTo build a realm where only I see through.\n\n**Conscience:**\n\nThy reign will crumble, like a house of sand,\nBuilt on deceit and stolen from this land. \nThe righteous eye shall pierce thy darkest guise,\nAnd justice swift shall lay thee to demise.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you desire another verse, or perhaps a different conflict to explore!
