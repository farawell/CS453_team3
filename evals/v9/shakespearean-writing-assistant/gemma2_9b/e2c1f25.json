  "output": "Hark! As day doth yield to night's embrace, \nAnd golden light doth fade from heaven's sphere,\nA soft, ethereal hue paints time and space,\nWhere shadows dance, and silent wishes hear.\n\nThe gentle breeze doth whisper through the trees,\nCarrying scents of roses, loam, and dew.\nThe birdsong fades, replaced by murmuring seas,\nAnd stars begin to pierce the deepening blue.\n\nOh, twilight hours, a canvas so divine,\nA blend of peace and magic undefined.\nWhere worries sleep, and thoughts can gently twine,\nA solace sweet for weary souls confined. \n\nSo let us pause and drink this beauty in,\nBefore darkness falls, and day's bright light doth sin.   \n\n\n",
