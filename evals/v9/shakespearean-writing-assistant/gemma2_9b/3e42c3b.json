  "output": "Hark! A tale I weave, of grief and loss profound, \nA heirloom gone, its story unsounded.\n\nWithin an ancient chest, of oak so dark and strong,\nLay treasures passed, 'fore time's relentless throng.\nA ruby necklace, with each gem aglow,\nGift of a king, to love long, long ago.\n\nHeirloom it was, through generations kept, \nEach link a story, secrets softly slept.\nBut fate, alas, did play a cruel jest,\nThe chest, once safe, laid open to the guest.\n\nA thief, unseen, with fingers swift and sly,\nPurloined the gems, beneath a moonlit sky.\nNow silence hangs where laughter once did chime,\nThe empty box speaks of loss, of fleeting time.\n\nWho stole this treasure, 'neath that velvet night? \nWhat dark desire, consumed their heart and might?\nNo answer comes, for shadows hide their face,\nLeaving only grief, in sorrow's hollow space.\n\n\n\n",
