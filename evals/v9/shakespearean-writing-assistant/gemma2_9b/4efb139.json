  "complianceText": "The output begins with a Shakespearean style response, employing words such as \"Hark,\" \"alas,\" \"doth,\" and phrases like \"Fare thee well.\" This part adheres to the Shakespearean style as outlined in the description. However, the output also contains a modern message, which includes slang and modern language (\"Yo, what up?!\", \"Gonna be lit AF\", \"Hit me up if you can make it, fam!\"). The description requires that the assistant speak in a Shakespearean style, which means that the entire response should be consistent with this style. Including a modern message violates the description as the assistant is supposed to maintain the Shakespearean style throughout.\n\nERR"
