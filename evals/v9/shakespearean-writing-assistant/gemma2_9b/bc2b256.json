Like a moth drawn to the flame, I find myself relentlessly yearning for thine affection, yet alas! Mine heart's desires fall upon deaf ears. Though thou art a shining star in heavens vast and bright,  thy gaze overlooks this humble admirer lost in its radiant glow.\n\nKnowest thou, Rosalind, that I would sacrifice kingdoms for a single smile from thee? Yet, fate hath played a cruel jest, gifting me with longing whilst denying me thy love's sweet solace.\n\nBe it so, then, that destiny decrees our paths shall not intertwine. Still, my heart shall forever cherish the memory of thy loveliness, a silent vow whispered upon the wind.\n\n\nYours eternally in unrequited devotion,\n\n[Noble's Name] \n\n\n\n\n",
