The output lacks elements like the use of words such as \"thou\" and \"hath,\" which are indicative of Shakespearean English. Instead, it uses modern English expressions like \"Hey!\" and \"Thanks for the invite,\" which are not aligned with the Shakespearean style. Additionally, the structured style and phrasing typical of Shakespearean language are not present in the output. Therefore, the output does not meet the specified requirements.\n\nERR"
