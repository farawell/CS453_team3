My tongue doth tremble as I speak these words of woe, \nFor friendship's golden thread hath snapped, and severed from below.\nWhere erstwhile laughter rang, now silence doth reside,\nAnd trust, like fragile blossom, in winter's chill hath died.\n\nAlas, what cruel twist of fate has brought us to this pass?\nA chasm wide and deep hath grown, where friendship once did amass. \nOur bond, forged in the fires of youthful glee,\nNow lies in ashes cold, a mournful memory.\n\n\n",
