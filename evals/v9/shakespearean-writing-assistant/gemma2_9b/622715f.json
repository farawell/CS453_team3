  "output": "The sun beats down upon my brow, a cruel tormentor in this endless azure vast. \n\nMy throat doth parch like parched earth, and salt stings my eyes that search the horizon's rim for any sign – a speck, a sail, a wisp of land!\n\nOh, Ocean, fickle mistress, thou art both cradle and grave!  I who traversed thy depths with fearless heart, now knowest the despair of being swallowed whole. \n\nMy comrades… Their forms flit through my mind, like phantoms on the waves. Did I hear them cry out? Or doth that echo in the hollow chambers of my soul?\n\nDespair doth claw at me, a beast with talons sharp as coral. Yet, within this tempest of sorrow, a flicker! A spark of hope! For even though the world be dark around me,  I shall not surrender to the night. \n I will fight the tide, for life still clings to me like barnacles to a ship… and I am no fragile vessel to break upon thy shores, O Sea!\n\n\n",
