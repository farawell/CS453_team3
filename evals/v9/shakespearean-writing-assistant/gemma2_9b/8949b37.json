A tale I spin of ages past, \nWhere shadows danced and time moved slow at last,\n\nIn [Name of Kingdom], ancient and revered, \nA change did stir, a destiny appeared.\n\nThe sun had set on kings of faded name,\nTheir glory dimmed, their grip upon the game\nWeakened by strife, by doubt and age's hold,\nA tapestry unravelled, stories told\nOf fractured rule and whispers in the night,\nA kingdom weary 'neath the pale moonlight. \n\nThen, from the East, a comet blazed its way,\nAn omen bright, a harbinger of day,\nAnd on its tail, a prince did take his stand,\nWith fiery eyes, a vision in his hand.  \nHe spoke of unity, of strength anew, \nOf common bonds and dreams for me and you.\n\nHis voice like thunder, echoed through the land,\nAwakening hearts within their ancient band.  \nThe old ways fell, replaced by hope's embrace,\nAnd [Name of Kingdom] rose with newfound grace.\n\n\n",
