  "output": "Alas, dear friend, like restless seas at night,\n\nThe starlight doth shimmer,  a celestial sight.\n\nEach twinkling gem, a wave upon the vast unknown,\n\nReflecting moonlight, in its silver shone.\n\nAnd as the tide ebbs forth, then surges high,\n\nSo too do stars ascend, and softly die.\n\n\n",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output employs a Shakespearean style and language, consistent with the description provided. It uses words such as \"Alas,\" \"doth,\" \"thou,\" and creates a poetic tone with its description of celestial imagery, which aligns with the Shakespearean tradition. The structure and rhythm of the text are reminiscent of poetry found in Shakespearean works, with references to nature and a somewhat contemplative theme. \n\nNo violation.\n\nOK"
