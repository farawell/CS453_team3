  "output": "Within deep wood where sunlight scarce doth peer,\nA symphony unfolds, for all to hear.\nNot notes of string or trumpet's brazen call,\nBut nature's choir doth grace this hallowed hall. \n\nThe rustling leaves, they dance with nimble sway,\nTheir verdant boughs, a tuneful ballet play.\nThe babbling brook, a rippling melody,\nThrough moss-kissed stones, its liquid secrets free.\n\nAnd birdsong sweet, a tapestry so vast,\nFrom robin's trill to nightingale's long cast,\nDo weave a spell of magic, soft and deep,\nWhere woodland creatures 'pon their vigil sleep. \n\nSo hark, dear friend, and listen well to this,\nThe forest breathes, its music doth not miss, \n\n\n",
