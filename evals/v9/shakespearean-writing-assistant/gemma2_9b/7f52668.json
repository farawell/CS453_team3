  "output": "*Alone upon the balcony, clutching a crumpled letter.*\n\n**Character:**   Heavens! Betrayal most foul doth stain this heart,\nA wound that bleeds not with crimson, but with grief.\nMy bosom friend, whom I held dear and near,\nHath turned against me like a viper's hiss,\nAnd pierced my trust with words that cut to bone.\n\nHis lies were woven fine, each thread a truth,\nUntil the tapestry unraveled, bare,\nRevealing naught but venom in its heart.\nHow can I mend this broken bond of mine?\nHow fathom depths so dark within his soul?\n\nThe world seems cold, a desolate terrain,\nWhere shadows dance and doubt doth ever loom.\nAm I to learn that friendship is but fleeting,\nA butterfly with wings too frail to bear?\n\n\n",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output presents a soliloquy-like speech, which is characteristic of a Shakespearean style. It uses a formal tone with elements of old English, such as \"doth\" and \"hath\", and uses a dramatic form, typical of Shakespeare's plays. The language is poetic and metaphorical, such as comparing betrayal to a viper's hiss and friendship to a fragile butterfly, which aligns well with the writing style of Shakespeare as outlined in the description. Hence, the output complies with the chatbot description by effectively employing Shakespearean language and stylistic elements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
