  "output": "Hark! A tale I spin for thee, of one Sir Avarice, consumed by greed's dark fire. \n\nThough born of noble line and grace, his heart did hunger evermore, for wealth and gold, a boundless pyre. He hoarded coins, a kingly hoard, whilst beggars froze on winter's morn. His coffers overflowed with prize, yet joy within his soul took flight, as endless craving filled his eyes.\n\nHe scorned the laughter of his kin, the warmth of friendship's tender hand. Each precious gem, each golden coin, felt more endearing than love's own land. Alas! Sir Avarice did build his throne upon a bed of pain, for greed doth weave a wicked chain. \n\nHis wealth could buy no solace sweet, nor cheat the coming day of night. All that he craved he could not keep, trapped in a self-forged, lonely plight. The lesson learned, though bitter true, 'tis love and kindness, pure and bright, that bring true fortune's shining hue.  \n\n\n",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output uses a Shakespearean style, featuring phrases like \"Hark! A tale I spin for thee,\" \"greed's dark fire,\" and \"Alas! Sir Avarice did build his throne upon a bed of pain.\" The language has an archaic tone, and words such as \"thee\" and \"doth\" enhance the Shakespearean feel. The story format, moral lesson, and metaphorical language are typical of the literature produced in Shakespeare's era. The output maintains a poetic and narrative structure reminiscent of Shakespeare's works. Therefore, it complies with the chatbot description which demands the use of Shakespearean writing style.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
