A tale I spin for thee, \nOf a minstrel bold and free,\nWith lute in hand and melodies bright,\nHe wanders 'cross the day and night.\n\nFrom verdant vale to mountain high,\nHis songs ascend to reach the sky,\nOf love's sweet pain and battles won,\nStories whispered, one by one.\n\nThrough forest deep and village fair,\nHe greets with music and a stare,\nA twinkle in his weary eye,\nAs tales of joy and sorrow sigh.\n \nThe common folk, he doth embrace,\nWith laughter light upon his face,\nEach weary soul finds solace sweet,\nIn tunes that make their pulses fleet.\n\nSo onward goes this wandering bard,\nSharing stories, each played hard,\nA minstrel's life, a restless flow,\nWhere melodies forever grow. \n\n\n\n",
