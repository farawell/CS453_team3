  "output": "Alas, that youthful bloom so quickly fades!\nLike roses kissed by morn's first golden ray, \nThey wither 'fore the sun's all-cheering glades,\nAnd leave but petals scattered in decay.\n\nA fickle sprite, Time doth his swift course hold,\nStealing youth's sweet beauty, day by day. \nWhere once did laughter ring, and stories told,\nNow shadows dance, and sorrow holds its sway.\n\nThe mirror shows a visage lined and gray,\nWhere youthful fire hath flickered and grown dim.\nWe chase the ghost of yesterday, I say,\nAnd pine for what we cannot bring back again.\n\nYet though youth's fleeting grace doth leave us bare, \nLet wisdom's light our waning strength repair.  \n\n\n",
