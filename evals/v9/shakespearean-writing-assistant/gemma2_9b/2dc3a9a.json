Let us but linger still,\nIn this sweet night, where love itself doth dwell.\n\n\n**Lover 2:** Though I would stay, and hold thee ever near, \nThe rising sun demands a swift farewell. \n\n **Lover 1:**  Then let the stars our parting tears receive,\nAnd whisper tales of love that shall not grieve.\n\n **Lover 2:** Until we meet beneath this moonlit sky,\nWithin my soul, thy memory will fly.\n\n\n**Lover 1:** And though the distance may sever our embrace,\nMy heart shall beat with love for time and space.\n\n\n\n",
