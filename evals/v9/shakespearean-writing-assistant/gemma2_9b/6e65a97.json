The chatbot is supposed to provide responses in a Shakespearean style using words like \"thou\" and \"hath,\" but the output is in a casual contemporary style. Phrases such as \"Honestly? It was kind of all over the place\" and \"I wouldn't totally recommend it\" reflect modern, casual language and do not align with Shakespearean style. There is no use of Shakespearean vocabulary or sentence structure in the output. \n\nERR"
