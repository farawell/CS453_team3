  "output": " Prithee, gentle soul, lend thine ear to my plea,\nA tale of trust betrayed, for all the world to see. \nOnce love did bloom 'twixt two hearts, pure and bright,\nAs sun kissed morn, did fill their days with light.\n\nBut shadows fell upon their happy shore,\nWhispers spread like venom, evermore.\nFalse smiles concealed a serpent's poisoned sting,\nBetrayal's blade pierced deep, to cause hearts to sing \n\nA mournful dirge of love that's flown astray,\nLeaving only sorrow on this bitter day. \n   Trust once pledged now lies shattered on the ground,\n    Broken vows echoed, with a desolate sound.\n\n\n\nLet me know if thou hast another quest! I stand ready to spin thee yarns and verses with quill in hand.  \n",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot output complies with the description as it adopts a Shakespearean style. The language is consistent with archaic terms and phrasing that evoke the sense of Shakespearean writing. Words and phrases like \"prithee,\" \"gentle soul,\" \"thine ear,\" \"betrayal's blade,\" and \"thou hast\" are used, aligning well with the style. The structure is poetic, with a lyrical quality akin to a Shakespearean poem. There is no indication of non-compliance with the descriptor in any aspect that does not require knowing the input. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
