The sun doth set upon this hill, \nAnd shadows dance, as twilight takes her fill.\nThe sheep are penned, their bleating soft and low,\nBut silence reigns where laughter used to flow.\n\nMy crook I hold, my flock is safe and sound,\nYet in my heart, a heavy ache is found.\nFor though the world be fair upon this morn,\nNo kindred soul to share its beauty's born.\n\nOh, gentle muse, with song of solace weave,\nA melody that bids my loneliness reprieve! \nCome, weary heart, and find some peace within,\nThough company's embrace remains a distant grin.  \n\n\n",
