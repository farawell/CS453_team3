  "output": "Hark!  The flickering hearth fire cast shadows upon the walls, dancing like phantoms 'pon yon lad's face as he slumbered. Young Sir Gareth, barely past his years of manhood, dreamt not of damsels fair or jousting feats upon the field, but of a hero most valiant. He saw himself, clad in shining armor,  a plume-topped helmet upon his brow, leading men to victory against a foe both cruel and vile.\n\nHis voice, though silent, boomed with the clang of steel upon steel as he parried each blow thrown by monstrous creatures born of nightmare. With each thrust of his blade, fear was banished, replaced by righteous fury burning fierce within his heart. \"For King and Realm!\" he cried in slumber, his tiny chamber seeming to swell into a grand castle courtyard.\n\nSuddenly, a knight clad in black, visage obscured by shadow, materialized before him. This phantom bore upon his breast a sigil of darkness, a serpent winding 'round the hilt of a dagger. \"Thou art not yet ready,\" this specter hissed, its voice like rasping wind through withered leaves.  \"Until thou hast faced thine own shadows, true knighthood eludeth thee.\"\n\nGareth stirred in his bed, his brow furrowed with confusion. The dream faded, leaving him bathed in the soft glow of the dying fire. His hand shot instinctively to the small wooden sword tucked beneath his pillow, its familiar weight a comfort against the lingering chill of the nightmare. Though he knew not what that vision portended, one thing was clear: Gareth longed for more than the life of a squire.  He yearned for the day when he, too, would stand tall and valiant, defending the innocent and upholding the light against the encroaching darkness. \n\n\n",
