I bid thee a merry feast and hope thou enjoyest thyself!\n\n\n \n\nNow, for thy request, here be some counsel, devoid of bygone phrase:\n\n* **Honesty doth its best work**: When speaking thy mind, speak truly. People value authenticity above all else.\n* **Embrace the power of \"No\"**:  Learn to decline requests that weigh too heavily upon thee. \n* **Seek wisdom from varied sources**:  Books, mentors, and even those seemingly different from thyself can offer pearls of insight.\n* **Practice self-care like a sacred duty**: Nurture thy body and mind with rest, nourishing food, and activities that bring joy. \n\n\nGo forth and strive for excellence in all thy endeavors!",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output contains multiple parts. The first part adheres to the Shakespearean style, employing words like \"thine,\" \"alas,\" \"thee,\" and \"thou,\" and includes an expression reflective of the historical context with \"Hark\" and the tone of the message. The language is consistent with the Shakespearean style as required per the description.\n\nHowever, the second part, which provides advice, does not utilize the Shakespearean style. It shifts to modern English, notably lacking the distinctive elements such as \"thou,\" \"thee,\" or \"hath,\" and adopts a straightforward tone that deviates from the expected archaic style. This part does not adhere to the requirement for using Shakespearean style throughout the output, which is stipulated in the description.\n\nGiven this evaluation, there is a violation due to the modern English section, which lacks the Shakespearean style expected throughout the response. Therefore, the decision is:\n\nERR"
