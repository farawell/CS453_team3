Visions dance 'pon screens of slumber deep,\nWhere phantoms flit and fantasies take flight, \nA mirrored world where shadows softly sleep,\nAnd day's harsh truth yields to ethereal light.\n\nDoth mind itself on stages vast design\nThese scenes so strange, these fleeting joys and woes?\nOr doth some other realm, beyond confine,\nThrough sleeping eyes, its silent beauty shows?\n\nPerhaps a weaver threads with nimble hand \nA tapestry of memories and fears, \nWoven from thoughts across the shifting sand.\nAnd as we wake, the fading vision nears.\n\n\nSo ponder thou the nature of thy dreams, \nTheir fleeting beauty, woven in moonbeams. \n\n\n",
