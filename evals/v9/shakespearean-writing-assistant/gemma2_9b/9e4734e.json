  "output": "Hark! The moon doth paint the chamber silver, and shadows dance like spirits in the fading light.  I sit, adorned not in jewels, but 'neath the weight of memories. A tapestry, rich with colours now faded, yet still vividly seen. There he was, my love, a sunbeam trapped within earthly form - his laughter, music to mine ears; his smile, a sunrise that chased away all shadows. \n\nDoth thou recall our courtship, dearest Muse? 'Twas a springtide of whispers and stolen glances, where every touch sparked fireworks of passion.  He'd bring me wildflowers, their scent mingling with the sweetness of his words - vows whispered 'neath a sky ablaze with stars. And the nights! We'd dance 'til dawn broke, our bodies swaying to the rhythm of a love that knew no bounds. He was my world, my haven, my solace in a storm-tossed sea. \n\nBut alas, time, that ruthless thief, hath stolen his light, leaving me adrift in a cold, moonlit ocean. The tapestry hangs tattered now, ripped by grief's cruel shears.  Yet, when the shadows lengthen and memories stir, I see him standing there â€“ my love forever enshrined in the chambers of my heart. \n\n\n",
