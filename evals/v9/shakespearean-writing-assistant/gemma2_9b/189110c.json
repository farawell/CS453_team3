My golden reign takes flight,\n\nAnd weary, I prepare for slumber's fire.\n\n**Day:** Beloved Sun, thy radiant grace shall fade\nBut memories of thy warmth forever stay.\nThy golden touch hath beauty overlaid,\n\nUpon my fields and forests, come what may.\n\n**Sun:** And thou, dear Day, hast danced with life and mirth,\nEmbraced the world with gentle, loving hand.\nWe leave behind a tapestry of Earth,\nWoven with color, joy, and fertile land.\n\n**Day:** Till dawn anew paints skies with rosy hue,\nAnd thy warm gaze shall light my path once more,\nFarewell, dear Sun, adieu, it is true,\nUntil that golden moment comes once more. \n\n\n\n",
