For the realm was beset by woe begotten, a dire serpent lurking in the shadowed woodlands, whose fiery breath did sear the very ground.\n\nOne morn, as dawn's gentle fingers kissed the sky, Sir Reginald, with resolve steely as an ancient oak, didst upon his steed of pale visage, renowned throughout the land as Tempest, set forth into the woods of chthonic hue. The leaves did rustle soft 'neath Tempest‚Äôs tread, the boughs their solemn vigils kept, as if they held their breath forsooth.\n\n\"Hark, Tempest mine,\" quoth Sir Reginald, his voice a clarion call unto the twisting paths, \"The hour is nigh, and we must face this beast whose terror hath plucked the joy from yonder hearts. Fear not, for courage in our breast, as stars in night's embrace, shall ever brightly burn.\"\n\nThus did Tempest and the knight ride deep into the realms of shadow, where sun doth seldom grace and naught but whispers of ancient lore echo. They arrived anon at the serpent‚Äôs dark abode, a cavern whose maw yawned wide and ominous. Within, the rancorous hiss of scales slithering upon stone did reverberate, and a fiery gaze pierced the gloom with menace dread.\n\n‚ÄúCome forth, vile serpent!‚Äù Sir Reginald‚Äôs voice rang out, ‚ÄúFor I, Sir Reginald of the Silver Crest, defy thee.

With a roar that shook the heavens, the serpent coiled, poised to strike.\n\nYet Sir Reginald, unshaken, brandished his sword, its edge keen as truth itself, and leapt upon his noble steed. Their battle did rage betwixt the thund‚Äôrous echoes and flashes bright, a dance of mortal foes entwined in conflict dire.\n\nAt length, with valor unmatched and fortune favored, Sir Reginald did find the serpent‚Äôs chink, its scaly armor‚Äôs sole flaw. With skillful thrust, he didst deliver a blow that smote the beast unto its doom, freeing the land from shadow‚Äôs grip.\n\nWith triumph in his heart, the knight did ride again unto the cheerful sun, where throngs of grateful souls did greet him with cheers resounding.

The rumors of his ambition spread like wildfire through yond village lanes, and wistful hearts in anxious murmurs spoke. ‚ÄúAlas!,‚Äù cried an elder wise, ‚ÄúBartholomew's vaults swell with ingots golden and silver'd, yet ne'er shall they suffice. Forsooth, in greed lies pauper's pittance, for riches sought in excess were ne‚Äôer known to still a restless spirit.‚Äù\n\nThus, a visit from Minerva, goddess of wisdom, did come upon him unawares; her visage lightsome as the moon's caress, her voice like the whisper of rustling leaves. ‚ÄúThou art ensnared,‚Äù she admonished, ‚Äúby shadows thou canst not clutch. Ambition unbridled makes a brief banquet of thine ephemeral peace.‚Äù\n\nBut heedless was Bartholomew to such celestial counsel, for the avarice within held mastery o'er his senses. In anxious pursuit of more, yea more than ever before, his estates crumbled, and his kin knew naught but strife and ruin.\n\nAnd so, from the ashes of his forgotten splendor rose a moral ripe for all to pluck: That which the heart doth covet can lay waste the fairest lands, and he who strives to possess all shall oft be left with none. Thus ends our tale of greed, a testament to the folly that doth hold sway o'er mortal hearts yet unillumined by wisdom's gentle light.",

Yet Beatrice, undaunted, with eyes that glittered like the morning star, would oft proclaim, \"Lo, though the night be dark, the dawn shall break anon, and new days doth bring with it the light of promise.\"\n\nBehold, her words, akin to a balm upon scalding wounds, roused within the hearts of her kinsfolk a spark anew.

The code also contains test functions to verify the generated code and the code completion functionality. \n\nThe AI has written a significant amount of extra code, possibly as part of an attempt to simulate more fully fleshed-out functionality in an IDE extension. However, this additional code appears to be syntactically incorrect and inconsistent with the intended functionality.

Eavesdropping upon the gentle hum of the marketplace, I hear whispers of fortune and folly, a tapestry woven with the threads of mortal endeavor. Classmates and neighbours engageth in jests, their laughter the very balm for a weary soul.\n\nFriends, how I long to stroll these cobbled paths with thee, to share discourse beneath yonder titian skies. Pray send word of thine own endeavours, that I might share in thy victories and yearn alongside thee for better days.

This haven, blessed by nature‚Äôs bounty and cradled by the azure sea, promised sweet solace from life‚Äôs weary toil.\n\nWith noble companions at his side, Sir Reginald was met with the gentle caress of the salt-laden breeze, which bade him welcome as he stepped ashore. Lo, the isle did unveil a tapestry of vibrant blossoms, betwixt which frolicked creatures rare and wondrous. Erelong, the merry company gathered 'neath the boughs of ancient oaks, where tales were spun with laughter and song accompanied by the lute's dulcet tones.\n\nA feast was held, of nature‚Äôs sumptuous fare, where figs, olives, and sweet nectarines did grace the board, and wine flowed as spring's rivers 'neath a whispering moon. Among this merriment, Sir Reginald's heart did dance with unbridled joy. Yea, the stars above did witnessed their heedless revelry, as time itself forsook its ceaseless march.\n\nYet, alas, the morn did come, herald of their journey‚Äôs end, when duty‚Äôs call must draw them hence from paradise's keep. Sir Reginald, his heart ailed with fond farewells, pledged to return. For in his bosom, he carried not just memories of mirth and splendor, but a yearning entwined with hope, that he might again behold the Isle of Serendipity where earthly troubles waned.\n\nThus, dear reader, ends this humble tale of respite, spun in the fashion of the Bard's own quill, wherein life found a brief but hallowed peace amidst life‚Äôs tempestuous sea.",

Verily, the moon doth wax and wane upon yon starry vale, though in its silver countenance my mind spins such tales as falter with coherence. From the blossoms where bloom the comeliest of daisies, I am swiftly drawn to the clash of arms on battlefields afar. \n\nHark, dost thou see the ocean's waves that whisper to the wind? Lo, in their gentle ebbs and flows abide tales untold, yet methinks the feathered quill of time paints other tales upon the sands.

Even as I do stray forth, sweet music haunts my ear‚Äîa lute's gentle plucking, an anthem to the moth that dances with the candle's light. Verily, the nightingale sings as if the stars themselves lean low to listen.\n\nAh, what sweet folly that mine own discourse, like a leaf in tempest's breath, knows no steadiness; for here I ponder the rumination of rust upon olden gear, and there I'm cast into the arms of Morpheus' realms, where slumber's sepulchres lie. \n\nForgive my ramble, such meandering musings art but an ever-changing tide sweeping o'er the shores of mine heart.

Prithee, consider mine tale fashioned in the image of the Bard's own devices:\n\nUpon a time, in fair Verona where the sun doth gild the sky with golden hues, there dwelt a gallant youth, Sir Lysander, whose visage bore the favor of the gods themselves. He, adorned with locks as dark as a raven's plume, found favor in the sunlit gaze of Lady Rosalind, whose beauty could e'en shame the lily's grace.\n\nEach day anon, they wouldst repair to the verdant bower beneath the yew, where blossoms precum each whisper of the zephyrs. There, with hearts entwin'd, did Sir Lysander proffer words of love that sang more sweetly than Orpheus‚Äô lute:\n\n‚ÄúO Rosalind, thou art the solar flame that doth illuminate mine heart‚Äôs own hemisphere. Each sunrise is afire with thy laughter, and each twilight sigh reflects thy melodious voice. If Heaven be o‚Äôershadowed, let thy presence dispel all gloom!‚Äù\n\nTo which the fair Rosalind replied, ‚ÄúGood Lysander, thy words art a balm unto mine ears. Thou art the beacon of mine affection; my spirit dost soar with thee as does the lark unto the heavens.‚Äù \n\nYet, amid their felicity, a tempest of discord did brew. For the noble Count Orsino espied Rosalind with a covetous eye and swore upon his honor to cleave her affections from Lysander's heart. With cunning machinations, he did sow seeds of doubt within their tender bosoms.\n\nDark was the hour when Orsino did plant the poisoned thought in Lysander's mind, whispering foul deceits betwixt their union, as venomous as the serpent‚Äôs bite. Troubled, Lysander approached Rosalind, saying:\n\n‚ÄúHath thy heart grown cold, sweet Rosalind? Hath a shadow eclipsed the joy we shared? Speak, and with thy breath melt away the hoarfrost that clingeth to my soul.‚Äù\n\nSil'd was the lady's heart; yet resolute stands Truth‚Äôs stalwart beam. Rosalind, with tears as pure as dew, did stand firm afore the gale of Orsino‚Äôs falsehoods, declaring:\n\n‚ÄúBy Winter‚Äôs breath and Summer‚Äôs kiss, I swear no vileness hath tainted my love. My heart is a steadfast fortress, standing undaunted by the storms of deceit.‚Äù\n\nIn triumphant embrace, the lovers reconciled beneath the moonlit boughs, casting aside the shadows of doubt wrought by Orsino. And so, harmony resumed its rightful throne, as they vowed eternal love in a world where virtue outshines guile.\n\nEre long did Orsino, thrice thwarted in mischief, depart with head bowed low, leaving the fair pair in their garden of dreams to savor the fruits of love‚Äôs sweet and bounteous harvest.\n\nThus closes our timeless curtain on this tale of love and valiant truth, a gentle reminder that the balm of honesty shall ever conquer the cankerous aims of envy and deceit.",
