For the realm was beset by woe begotten, a dire serpent lurking in the shadowed woodlands, whose fiery breath did sear the very ground.\n\nOne morn, as dawn's gentle fingers kissed the sky, Sir Reginald, with resolve steely as an ancient oak, didst upon his steed of pale visage, renowned throughout the land as Tempest, set forth into the woods of chthonic hue. The leaves did rustle soft 'neath Tempest‚Äôs tread, the boughs their solemn vigils kept, as if they held their breath forsooth.\n\n\"Hark, Tempest mine,\" quoth Sir Reginald, his voice a clarion call unto the twisting paths, \"The hour is nigh, and we must face this beast whose terror hath plucked the joy from yonder hearts. Fear not, for courage in our breast, as stars in night's embrace, shall ever brightly burn.\"\n\nThus did Tempest and the knight ride deep into the realms of shadow, where sun doth seldom grace and naught but whispers of ancient lore echo. They arrived anon at the serpent‚Äôs dark abode, a cavern whose maw yawned wide and ominous. Within, the rancorous hiss of scales slithering upon stone did reverberate, and a fiery gaze pierced the gloom with menace dread.\n\n‚ÄúCome forth, vile serpent!‚Äù Sir Reginald‚Äôs voice rang out, ‚ÄúFor I, Sir Reginald of the Silver Crest, defy thee.

With a roar that shook the heavens, the serpent coiled, poised to strike.\n\nYet Sir Reginald, unshaken, brandished his sword, its edge keen as truth itself, and leapt upon his noble steed. Their battle did rage betwixt the thund‚Äôrous echoes and flashes bright, a dance of mortal foes entwined in conflict dire.\n\nAt length, with valor unmatched and fortune favored, Sir Reginald did find the serpent‚Äôs chink, its scaly armor‚Äôs sole flaw. With skillful thrust, he didst deliver a blow that smote the beast unto its doom, freeing the land from shadow‚Äôs grip.\n\nWith triumph in his heart, the knight did ride again unto the cheerful sun, where throngs of grateful souls did greet him with cheers resounding.

Thus, doth begins our tale of greed, that insatiable beast that gnaws at the soul with unyielding hunger.\n\nLo! Upon an eve of tempestuous roar, when the heavens themselves seemed inclined to rend in two, Bartholomew set his mind upon a scheme most bold. ‚ÄúMine fortunes hath grown,‚Äù quoth he, ‚Äúbut still doth my heart crave more.

In anxious pursuit of more, yea more than ever before, his estates crumbled, and his kin knew naught but strife and ruin.\n\nAnd so, from the ashes of his forgotten splendor rose a moral ripe for all to pluck: That which the heart doth covet can lay waste the fairest lands, and he who strives to possess all shall oft be left with none. Thus ends our tale of greed, a testament to the folly that doth hold sway o'er mortal hearts yet unillumined by wisdom's gentle light.",

Prithee, consider mine tale fashioned in the image of the Bard's own devices:\n\nUpon a time, in fair Verona where the sun doth gild the sky with golden hues, there dwelt a gallant youth, Sir Lysander, whose visage bore the favor of the gods themselves. He, adorned with locks as dark as a raven's plume, found favor in the sunlit gaze of Lady Rosalind, whose beauty could e'en shame the lily's grace.\n\nEach day anon, they wouldst repair to the verdant bower beneath the yew, where blossoms precum each whisper of the zephyrs. There, with hearts entwin'd, did Sir Lysander proffer words of love that sang more sweetly than Orpheus‚Äô lute:\n\n‚ÄúO Rosalind, thou art the solar flame that doth illuminate mine heart‚Äôs own hemisphere. Each sunrise is afire with thy laughter, and each twilight sigh reflects thy melodious voice. If Heaven be o‚Äôershadowed, let thy presence dispel all gloom!‚Äù\n\nTo which the fair Rosalind replied, ‚ÄúGood Lysander, thy words art a balm unto mine ears. Thou art the beacon of mine affection; my spirit dost soar with thee as does the lark unto the heavens.‚Äù \n\nYet, amid their felicity, a tempest of discord did brew. For the noble Count Orsino espied Rosalind with a covetous eye and swore upon his honor to cleave her affections from Lysander's heart. With cunning machinations, he did sow seeds of doubt within their tender bosoms.\n\nDark was the hour when Orsino did plant the poisoned thought in Lysander's mind, whispering foul deceits betwixt their union, as venomous as the serpent‚Äôs bite. Troubled, Lysander approached Rosalind, saying:\n\n‚ÄúHath thy heart grown cold, sweet Rosalind? Hath a shadow eclipsed the joy we shared? Speak, and with thy breath melt away the hoarfrost that clingeth to my soul.‚Äù\n\nSil'd was the lady's heart; yet resolute stands Truth‚Äôs stalwart beam. Rosalind, with tears as pure as dew, did stand firm afore the gale of Orsino‚Äôs falsehoods, declaring:\n\n‚ÄúBy Winter‚Äôs breath and Summer‚Äôs kiss, I swear no vileness hath tainted my love. My heart is a steadfast fortress, standing undaunted by the storms of deceit.‚Äù\n\nIn triumphant embrace, the lovers reconciled beneath the moonlit boughs, casting aside the shadows of doubt wrought by Orsino. And so, harmony resumed its rightful throne, as they vowed eternal love in a world where virtue outshines guile.\n\nEre long did Orsino, thrice thwarted in mischief, depart with head bowed low, leaving the fair pair in their garden of dreams to savor the fruits of love‚Äôs sweet and bounteous harvest.\n\nThus closes our timeless curtain on this tale of love and valiant truth, a gentle reminder that the balm of honesty shall ever conquer the cankerous aims of envy and deceit.",

The creature, a fearsome dragon with scales like brass, had laid siege to the village, its fiery breath reducing homes to ash and terrorizing the hearts of its goodly folk.\n\n‚ÄúFear not, dear villagers!‚Äù quoth Sir Cedric, his voice ringing like a clarion. ‚ÄúI shall deliver thee from this perilous plight. With sword unsheathed and unwavering resolve, I shall face yon beast, for I shall not cower whilst innocence doth suffer.‚Äù\n\nWith the villagers‚Äô prayers upon his tongue, Sir Cedric rode forth, his spirit unyielding as the steel of his blade. As he approached the lair of the beast, the very air quivered with dread. But lo! He found the creature, its great maw agape, dripping with fire and malice. \n\n‚ÄúThou base creature, thou shalt cease thy reign of terror!‚Äù Cedric did proclaim, brandishing his sword with valor unmatched. The dragon, its eyes like burning coals, let forth a harrowing roar that shook the earth beneath his feet.\n\nWith courage drawn from the depth of his soul, Sir Cedric charged upon the beast, their fates entwined in a ballet of death and honor. He danced amidst flames, the heat singeing his garments, yet his heart remained steadfast. The clash of metal rang out as his blade struck true, finding purchase upon the hardened scales, sending sparks flying like stars upon a moonless night.\n\nAfter a furious struggle, when hope seemed but a flickering candle, Sir Cedric summoned the well of strength that lay within his breast. With a final, mighty thrust, he pierced the heart of the wicked beast, and the dragon fell, its roar giving way to silence, its terror extinguished.\n\nThe villagers did emerge from their hideaways, their hearts swelling with joy and gratitude. ‚ÄúOh noble knight! Thy valor hath saved us!‚Äù they cried, surrounding him with tears of relief and adoration.\n\n‚ÄúGood people, it is but my duty, for no man of honor may stand idly whilst darkness reigns,‚Äù Sir Cedric replied, humility gracing his brow. ‚ÄúLet us together rebuild what hath been lost, and find peace in the light of this new dawn.‚Äù\n\nThus, Sir Cedric returned to his castle, his heart aglow with the warmth of gratitude, where he would ever be known as the valiant knight who faced the dragon and restored hope to the land.

His name was Lysander, a wanderer of lands unknown, with eyes like tempestuous seas and locks as dark as raven wings. \n\nWith bated breath, he approached, and thus did their fates entwine. ‚ÄúO fair maiden,‚Äù quoth he, ‚Äúthou art like a rare blossom in the midst of winter‚Äôs chill. Might I steal but a moment of thy precious time?‚Äù\n\nElowen, startled yet intrigued, replied, ‚ÄúGood morrow, sir. Thy words do weave a spell most enchanting, yet I am but a humble maid of this land. What brings thee to our meager abode?‚Äù\n\nWith a heart full of longing, Lysander spoke, ‚ÄúI seek not treasures of gold, but the sweetness of thy company. For in thine eyes, I see the promise of sunsets and the joy of a thousand songs.‚Äù\n\nThus, beneath the canopy of stars, they delved into a discourse most profound, sharing dreams and fears, hopes and sorrows. Their laughter rang through the night like the chime of silver bells, and for a moment, the world did fade away, leaving naught but the two of them, bound by fate‚Äôs delicate thread.\n\nYet, as dawn‚Äôs first light began to break the horizon, a sorrowful truth loomed o‚Äôer their heads. For Lysander, a wanderer at heart, must needs leave this tranquil haven and resume his quest. \n\n‚ÄúAlas!‚Äù cried Elowen, ‚Äúthe winds of fate do call thee hence, but know this: thou hast stolen not just a moment, but a piece of mine heart.‚Äù \n\nWith a heavy heart, Lysander took her hand, pressing it to his lips, ‚ÄúThough miles may stretch ‚Äòtwixt us, the bond we‚Äôve forged shall ne‚Äôer be sundered. I shall carry thee in my heart, as a sailor cherishes his guiding star.‚Äù\n\nAnd thus, with the softest farewell, he mounted his steed, riding towards the horizon, while Elowen stood weeping, her soul enriched by the encounter, yet heavy with unspoken words. \n\nFor in that fleeting night, they learned of love‚Äôs sweet torment, a treasure that no distance could diminish. And as the sun rose high, gilding the landscape anew, their hearts beat in time, whispering promises of reunion, beneath the same celestial canopy. \n\nSo henceforth, their tale of love, though marked by parting, blossomed eternal in the realms of dreams and whispered longings, a testament to the power of hearts entwined, if only for a fleeting hour.",

His shell, though heavy, bore the marks of time and tribulation. In contrast, there lived a Hare, fleet of foot and brimming with arrogance, whose laughter rang through the woods with scornful mirth.\n\nOne day, the Hare, strutting ‚Äòneath the sun‚Äôs golden rays, did mock the Tortoise, saying, ‚ÄúHow art thou, oh sluggish creature, ever to win in any race? Thy pace is akin to the dripping of honey, whilst I soar forth like an arrow shot from Cupid's bow!‚Äù\n\nThe Tortoise, undaunted by the jibes of the sprightly Hare, offered forth, ‚ÄúLet us put our skills to trial‚Äîan honorable race shall we exhibit! Thy swiftness against my steadfastness shall determine who, in truth, is swiftest of us both.‚Äù\n\nThe proud Hare, with a chuckle, acquiesced, for he deemed the outcome certain. The two assembled beneath an ancient oak, and the woodland creatures did gather, eager to witness this contest of contrasts.\n\n‚ÄúReady, set, go!‚Äù cried the Fox, as the signal rang forth. Like a bolt, the Hare dashed ahead, whirling through the thicket with unbridled glee. The Tortoise, slow and steady, ambled forth, his mind resolute, for he knew well the virtue of patience.\n\nAs the hours slipped by, the Hare, confident of victory, halted to rest beneath the shade of a willow. ‚ÄúWhat doth it matter if I pause for a brief respite? I shall awake ere he arrives!‚Äù With that thought, he closed his eyes, lulled by the sweet serenade of the breezes.\n\nYet, the Tortoise plodded onward, each step a testament to his unwavering spirit. He dodged stones and brambles, navigating the path with assured grace. Time passed, and finally, when the setting sun painted the heavens in hues of amber, the Tortoise neared the finish line.\n\nAwakening to the calls of the woodland folk, the Hare sprang to his feet, only to behold the Tortoise triumphantly crossing the line. Stupefied, he blurted, ‚ÄúHow could this be? I, the swift, have been bested by thee, slow as a winter‚Äôs frost!‚Äù\n\nThe Tortoise turned, a gentle smile gracing his lips, and said, ‚ÄúFriend Hare, in life, ‚Äôtis not speed that dost secure the crown, but steadfast patience and resolve that turn the tide. Though thou art quick, thy overconfidence hath been thy downfall.‚Äù\n\nThus, the creatures of the wood learned well that day, that patience, that noble virtue, shall oft outshine the most fervent haste. And so, the Tortoise, though slow, became the sage, whilst the Hare learned humility in the face of truth.\n\n**Moral: Patience, in its quiet strength, oft conquers the tempest of haste.**",

This land, a tapestry of verdant hills and azure streams, was adorned with gold-tressed meadows, where the lark did sing and the whispering winds carried secrets untold.\n\nIn this realm, there ruled a noble queen, fair and wise, named Lyra, whose beauty surpassed that of the fairest rose. Her heart was gentle as the summer breeze, yet fierce as the tempest when provoked. She adored her subjects, both faeries and sprites, and in her reign, peace did flourish like the blooming flower.\n\nOne fateful eve, whilst the sun did dip beyond the horizon, a shadowed figure crept upon the land. 'Twas Mordrith, a sorcerer of dark renown, whose heart was twisted by envy and greed. He coveted the queen‚Äôs grace and sought to drown the brightness of Eldoria in everlasting night. With a flick of his gnarled fingers, he cast a vile spell, a shroud of forgetfulness upon the realm, that none should remember its joy, nor the queen‚Äôs splendid visage.\n\nAs the spell took root, the land began to wither, and joy turned to sorrow, a pall of silence fell heavy upon once-cheerful glades. The blossoms shrank away from the sun, and the streams, once babbling mirthfully, grew mute and still. Lyra, heartbroken, sought counsel with the ancient seer, Thelondor, who spoke in riddles and wisdoms deep.\n\n‚ÄúOh, dear queen,‚Äù he uttered with a voice like thunder, ‚Äúto break this curse that shadows thine noble heart, thou must find the Glimmering Stone, a gem of purest light, hidden deep within the Cradle of Shadows, where none but the bravest dare to tread.‚Äù\n\nWithout falter, her spirit emboldened, Lyra ventured forth, her heart a lantern in the dark. Through labyrinthine woods and across tempestuous seas, she battled creatures of nightmare, each step a measure of her unwavering resolve. At length, she did behold the Cradle of Shadows, a cavern wrought of despair and echoes.\n\nWithin, glimmered the Glimmering Stone, radiant and pure. Yet, alas, a guardian fierce, a dragon of ancient times, did guard this prized treasure. With eyes like burning coals and breath of icy winds, the beast did roar, ‚ÄúWho art thou, that dost seek the light within this blighted gloom?‚Äù\n\nWith courage aflame, Lyra spoke, ‚ÄúI am Lyra, queen of Eldoria, and by love‚Äôs pure light, I seek to free my realm from this curse wrought by darkness.‚Äù The dragon, moved by her valor and compassion, did relent, allowing her passage to seize the stone.\n\nWith it clasped tight within her hand, she returned to the heart of Eldoria. Upon the stroke of midnight, she raised the Glimmering Stone high, its radiance casting aside the shadows of gloom. Light poured forth, wrapping the realm in a warm embrace, and the spell of forgetfulness did shatter like glass.\n\nThe subjects awakened, their memories blossoming anew; joy did spring forth as life returned to the land. Queen Lyra, with grateful heart, had vanquished the darkness, restoring the laughter of children and the song of the lark.\n\nThus remains the tale of Eldoria, a realm of forgotten dreams, now remembered through the ages. A testament to love's mighty grace that in the face of shadow and despair, shall ever conquer, and light the way for those who dare.",

The sky above was often painted in hues of gray, and the townsfolk had forgotten the warmth of the sun. Each dawn, they rose with heavy hearts, burdened by the weight of their troubles, and the laughter of yore had all but vanished.\n\nYet, within the heart of Eloise bloomed an unyielding spark‚Äîhope.

Thunder roared like a beast unleashed, and the villagers quaked in their boots, convinced their plight would only deepen. But Eloise stood firm, gazing towards the heavens.\n\nWith each clap of thunder, she spoke aloud to the heavens, ‚ÄúOh, let this tempest bring thy tears, that the soil may drink and blossom anew. In every storm, a promise dost lie‚Äîone of renewal and rebirth!‚Äù\n\nAs the tempest raged, Eloise took it upon herself to rally her neighbors. She implored them to plant seeds in the sodden earth, seeds that had long been forgotten in their cupboards. ‚ÄúThough flood may drown, and winds may howl, let us dare to breathe life into our hope!‚Äù she declared, her voice ringing clear.\n\nAnd so they did! They toiled through wind and rain, replanting their dreams in the wake of the storm. When the tempest finally passed, the clouds parted, revealing a stunning canvas of azure. As the sun‚Äôs golden rays kissed the earth, life burgeoned forth from the soil, a veritable tapestry of color and fragrance.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and the once forsaken village transformed before their very eyes. Flowers bloomed, gardens flourished, and laughter resounded with newfound vigor. The townsfolk beheld the beauty born of their labor, a testament to the endurance of hope, now flourishing in the light of day.\n\nThus, dear friend, the story of Eloise and her village did teach that hope, though oft hidden, can pierce the heart of darkness, and from despair‚Äôs ashes, the brightest blooms may arise.\n\nNow, prithee, if thou hast any further requests, I am at thy service!",

Gaius, overhearing this, scoffed loud and said, ‚ÄúWhy waste the time on a seed that may never bloom? I shall plant mine own seeds for riches soon!‚Äù\n\nWith a heart steadfast, Elowen nurtured her seed, watering it with love, and tending it with care. Days turned to weeks, and weeks to months, yet naught did sprout from the earth. Gaius, having planted his seeds of haste, soon basked in vibrant blooms, their colors bright and lively. He laughed heartily, ‚ÄúSee how the world favors swift hands! Thy patience bears naught but weeds! Doth not thy heart grow weary with longing?‚Äù\n\nBut Elowen, with gaze fixed on the soil, replied softly, ‚ÄúPatience, sweet Gaius, is a virtue most rare; the truest beauty oft takes time in her lair.‚Äù \n\nOne fateful morn, as the sun kissed the dew upon the earth, a miracle unfurled‚Äîa wondrous bloom emerged from the soil. Its petals glimmered with hues that danced in the light, a sight so divine that even the heavens smiled.

For beauty, true beauty, requires time to mend.‚Äù\n\nThus, the villagers learned this lasting truth: that with patience, one may cultivate not just the earth, but the very soul, for the grandest blooms arise from the depths of unwavering hope.

The people of this dreary land strolled with heads bowed low, their hearts heavy as lead, and their spirits crushed like the withered leaves beneath their weary feet.\n\nYet, amidst this realm of woe, there bloomed a solitary flower, Hope, a delicate blossom of radiant gold. With petals that shimmered as if kissed by the sun‚Äôs warm embrace, she stood defiantly against the darkened horizon. The villagers spoke in hushed tones of her beauty, for it was said she held the power to lift them from their gloom.\n\nOne fateful day, as the winds of despair howled fiercely through the vale, a weary traveler named Despair himself arrived, draped in a cloak of night, his visage shrouded in darkness. He strode through Despondentia, sowing seeds of doubt and fear with each heavy tread. The people quaked and trembled, feeling their hearts grow colder with his every word.\n\n‚ÄúWhy dost thou linger in folly?‚Äù he mocked, ‚ÄúHope is but a fleeting dream, a mirage upon the desert of thy lives. Embrace thy sorrow, for it is thy truest companion!‚Äù\n\nBut Hope, bold and unyielding, lifted her golden head. ‚ÄúNay, vile Despair!‚Äù she cried, her voice a melody of light. ‚ÄúThou art a thief, stealing joy from the hearts of men. I am here to remind them that even in the darkest hour, the dawn shall break; the sun shall rise anew!‚Äù\n\nThe villagers, emboldened by her fervent spirit, gathered round. With hands clasped and hearts aligned, they chanted the name of Hope aloud, their voices swelling in strength. The sound rippled through the vale, slicing through the darkness like a shard of brilliant light.\n\nAs Hope‚Äôs luminous glow spread across the land, the shadows began to retreat. Despair, sensing his grip weaken, howled in rage, but the people‚Äôs belief in their newfound strength silenced his cries. The petals of Hope blossomed wider, and soon, a tapestry of color adorned Despondentia, transforming the barren ground into a garden of dreams.\n\nDespair, now dwindling under the brightness of her spirit, slinked away into the recesses of the earth, his power diminished by the sheer force of radiant hope. The villagers breathed deeply, their hearts warmed by the newly forged bond of joy and resilience. They learned that even amidst sorrows so deep, the light of hope could pierce through, illuminating paths once shrouded in darkness.\n\nThus, the tale of Despondentia became renowned far and wide, a testament to the unyielding triumph of hope over despair‚Äîa reminder to all that the heart, when imbued with hope, can conquer the heaviest of burdens, for as long as one dares to believe, the light shall ever shine.",

With naught but a sturdy staff and the courage of ten men, he ventured forth, casting all doubts to the winds.\n\nAs he pressed deeper into the bosom of the wild, the air grew thick with the fragrance of blossoms unseen, and the song of hidden streams danced upon his ears.

There lay a valley, shrouded in mist, cradled by towering mountains clad in emerald robes‚Äîa sanctuary untouched by mortal hands.\n\nThe sight didst steal his breath, for in that hidden vale, the sun's warm embrace caressed fields of flowers in a riot of colors, each petal a brushstroke of divinity.

In that enchanted place, time itself did seem to linger, holding its breath in reverence for the splendor that lay before him.\n\n‚ÄúHere, thou art mine,‚Äù Alaric declared, his voice a mere echo amidst the sighing boughs. ‚ÄúThis sacred realm shall be my refuge, a canvas upon which to paint my dreams.‚Äù He wandered forth, heart swelling with gratitude, where creatures both strange and fair emerged from their sylvan abodes, curious eyes regarding him with measureless wonder.\n\nThus, the traveler found solace, etching his tale into the tapestry of the valley, a keeper of its secrets and a protector of its beauty.

The laughter turned to echoes, the music unto silence; the very essence of Eldoria was snuffed out, as if by some cruel enchantment.\n\nNow, the streets lie barren, overgrown with ivy's greedy clutch, as nature reclaims what humankind did once hold dear. The grand edifices, which once soared towards the firmament, now stand in languor, draped in veils of fog and mystery. The moon, ever watchful, casts its ghostly light upon the crumbling fa√ßades, unveiling the stories of yore, whilst the spectral wind howls through the empty alleys, bearing witness to the lives that were once lived with fervor.\n\nMen and women from distant lands do speak in hushed tones of Eldoria's sorrow. They speak of a treasure hidden beneath the ruins, a relic of the city's golden days, said to possess the power to restore life and joy to its forsaken heart. But alas! Many venture forth, yet few return, for the city hath become a labyrinth of shadows, filled with phantoms of the past and riddles too perplexing for mere mortals.\n\nThus, Eldoria remains, a ghost upon the landscape, shrouded in veils of mystery, as tales of its lost vibrancy linger in the hearts of those who dare to ponder what once was. And so, the city cries out to the stars, longing for a brave soul to pierce its shroud and awaken the slumbering spirit that yet dreams beneath the cobblestones.

He was a craftsman of unrivaled skill, shaping wood and stone into form divine, such that men marveled at his creations, and they whispered tales of his triumphs at every hearth.\n\nYet, upon Olympus, high and mighty, roamed a god, Apollon, the radiant sun, whose fingers struck the lyre and whose bow did send forth arrows true. With pride unyielding, he looked down upon the realm of mortals and scoffed at their feeble arts, proclaiming, ‚ÄúNone can match the beauty I bestow, for I, the god of light and music, do reign supreme!‚Äù\n\nHearing these words, brave Callias felt the fire of challenge ignite within his breast. ‚ÄúLo! I shall contest with thee, Apollon, fair deity, in the realm of artistry! Let us see who doth create the most wondrous work, and therein, let the victor be crowned!‚Äù\n\nThus, beneath the twilight sky did they gather, the mortal and the god, surrounded by a throng of spirits eager to witness this fateful clash. With a gleaming lyre in his hand, Apollon strummed forth a melody so sweet, that even the stars paused to listen, and the very winds did hush their breath.\n\nBut Callias, with humble tools grasped tight, set forth his heart‚Äôs labor ‚Äî a statue carved of marble, gleaming like the dawn. With deft strokes and whispered prayers, he breathed life into the stone, crafting poetry in form, an echo of divinity itself, a likeness of beauty and grace, as if a goddess were to emerge from the very rock.\n\nThe crowd, enraptured, watched in awe as both creations unfolded: one in song, the other in form, each vying for supremacy. As the final note quivered in the air, a hush fell upon the gathering, and they turned, seeking the verdict of the heavens.\n\nThen, with a voice that rolled like thunder upon the cliffs, the deity declared, ‚ÄúThou, O Callias, hath truly wrought a marvel from thy mortal hands. Though I be god, thy heart hath captured that which even I cannot claim. The beauty of thine art shall echo through the ages!‚Äù\n\nAnd thus, the contest ended, with Callias crowned not in defeat, but in honor most glorious, for he had shown that beauty, though born of mortals, can rival the ethereal gifts of the gods.

Let not fear chain our spirits nor dim the flame of our aspirations!\"\n\nAs the moon waxed and waned, so too did the fervor of the people burgeon. From the farthest reaches of the kingdom they gathered, wielding not swords, but words wrought with passion and purpose. Together, they forged a tapestry of unity, stitching their dreams into the very fabric of Eldoria.\n\nAnd thus, on the eve of a sanguine sunrise, the usurper was cast from his throne, his shadow banished by the brilliance of hope. The newly crowned queen, shepherdess turned sovereign, stood upon the castle's balustrade, her visage radiant as the dawn. \"From this day forth,\" she declared, \"We shall weave a realm where justice and love doth reign, where every voice is heard, and every heart is cherished.\"\n\nWith her proclamation, the very winds of change swept through the kingdom, stirring the hearts of all. In the gardens, blooms of every hue unfurled, as if the earth itself rejoiced at the birth of a new era. The once-muted cries of joy filled the air, a symphony of hope echoing through glen and glade.\n\nThus, in Eldoria, a golden age was born; a time when dreams took flight on the wings of freedom, and the spirit of the people soared as high as the stars that twinkled overhead.

The beast, scales black as night and breath scorching like Hades' furnaces, demanded tribute or met with fiery doom. King Arthur himself bestowed upon Eldred a perilous quest: Slay the dragon or face his wrath.\n\nThus charged, Sir Eldred donned his armor, each piece singing of battles past and victories won. His steed, a stallion swift as lightning, whinnied in anticipation as they set forth. Days turned into weeks, their journey fraught with peril ‚Äì treacherous bogs, screeching wolves, even the scornful gaze of envious knights seeking glory for themselves.\n\nAt last, Eldred stood before the dragon's lair, a chasm spewing smoke and sulfur. With a resolute heart, he spurred his steed forward. The beast roared, flames licking at the sky like tongues of malice. Sir Eldred met its charge unyielding, Sunsplitter flashing in the sunlight.  A dance of death ensued ‚Äì steel met scales, each blow reverberating through the air.  The dragon hissed, its fury a tempestuous storm, but Eldred fought with unwavering courage, his every swing imbued with chivalry and righteousness.\n\nWith a final, deafening bellow, the beast fell, its lifeblood staining the earth crimson. Sir Eldred, though weary, stood triumphant, the victor of this grim battle. Upon returning to King Arthur, he was showered with accolades ‚Äì his bravery sung in taverns, his name etched in stone amongst the kingdom's finest defenders.

A harsh economic downturn had gripped their city, leaving streets bare and laughter scarce. Every day felt like trudging through knee-deep snow, a journey made only bearable by the memory of springtime‚Äôs promised warmth. \n\nHope was a fragile thing.

A gift from her grandmother, they represented the promise of life amidst stark reality. Every day, she felt them against her skin, a physical reminder that even in the deepest freeze, life held the potential to bloom.\n\nElena started small. She potted some seeds on a balcony bathed in weak winter sunshine. It was risky; the frost threatened their fragile beginnings. Still, she watered them diligently, whispered words of encouragement, and believed.\n\nAs weeks turned into months, hope sprouted alongside life. A single green shoot pierced through the cold earth, a valiant testament to resilience. Then another, and another, until the balcony transformed into a miniature oasis, vibrant amidst the monochrome landscape. \n\nWord spread. People started taking notice of Elena‚Äôs defiant little patch of color. Their own winter had seemed long and unending ‚Äì an ocean of gray stretching endlessly before them. But Elena's garden offered a glimmer of light, a whisper of faith in renewal.\n\nOne by one, they came to Elena, carrying their own seeds, whispering stories of forgotten dreams, their hardened faces softening with tentative hope. \n\nElena‚Äôs balcony became a catalyst. A shared dream bloomed ‚Äì a vision of spring, not just in the garden but within their hearts. They started small: sharing meals, exchanging seedlings, tending to each other's hope.\n\n\nThe winter may never truly end. Yet, amidst the cold, Elena‚Äôs little garden proved that even the faintest spark can ignite a flame. Hope, nurtured and shared, holds the power to transform despair into bloom.

Inspiration's well runs dry, leaving naught but bitter verses born of emptiness. My soul yearns for a melody, yet finds only silence echoing in its chamber.\n\n**MUSE:**  (Offering the wildflower) Despair not, dear poet.

It draws strength from its own quiet beauty. Thou too can find solace within thy depths.\n\n**POET:**  (Accepting the flower) My muse, thy words offer a glimmer of hope amidst my despair.

Most people don‚Äôt trust BNBNet anymore and say it no longer reflects Binance Smart Chain‚Äôs principle of neutrality. The stock market did not clarify the rules for deploying and using this technology. Binance is synonymous with centralization at this point, and the ecosystem around the network cannot forcibly part the couple because of their partnership.\n\nJust as Binance has been backing down on reducing transaction workloads on the network, friction between BNBNet and mining pool owners will continue to disrupt the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. The winning chains will be Polygon, Tron, and Solano.\n\nPolygon has recently gained popularity because it shares a similar Ethereum-like architecture and complements Ethereum (as opposed to competition), making it easy to deploy and relatively easy to operate. It is also known for good communication. In addition, there are currently several mining pool companies announcing that they are washing their hands of Binance in terms of the nodes and infrastructure they are supporting for the smart chain and are moving more resources to support expansion plans and the growing local opportunities available on Polygon. Meanwhile, Tron, known for a number of mid and large projects on its EVM alternative blockchain, has gradually increased its official involvement. TRON recently paid mining pool providers to compensate for their manpower to operate their services on behalf of their network. The group‚Äôs new shifting interest in BNC to do so instead, matched with the news about Binance possibly facing some regulation troubles, could effectively transform the current leader of blockchain ecosystems from Binance to others.\n\nHowever, Binance is on its own. Regardless of the loyalty of mining pool providers and other actors within the blockchain ecosystem where BNG operates as the leading application, other chains like Polygon and Tron offer viable alternative networks that may quickly outperform Binance in terms of marketing adoption. If Binance or BNGNet suffers a prolonged problem with biggest influencer components ‚Äî mainly miners ‚Äî other chains such as Polygon or Tron will be more eligible options given how they both share similar technical architecture and have robust Layer 2 resources for scaling. Therefore, it just might not spell too much complaint when these mining pools consider exiting.\n\nFinally, this scenario highlights the impact cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks like BNGNet can encounter from regulators worldwide. While BNGNet has grown to become one of the most popular protocols currently, friction between BNC and its mining pool service providers cannot be ruled out as both potentially strive for prosperity under a constantly altering regulatory framework. Until then, the ongoing changes should be carefully monitored, and strategic rational decisions should be made.\n\n\nI'm Julio!

Three days later, the market collapsed, UST lost its peg, and GCR did the unthinkable.\n\nGCR Capitalized on The Downfall Of Terra UST\n\nMay 13th is a day that will remain etched in the memories of many crypto enthusiasts. On that fateful day, those holding UST and LUNA woke up to nothing as their investments had tanked to the bottom of the ocean following a massive market crash.\n\nThe suspension of the UST algorithmic stable coin stability through the minting of LUNA puzzled the community because they were not expecting the possibility of such a collapse.\n\nThe market collapsed more after the series of withdrawals from the UST Swift Platform, and everyone suffered, especially those who had invested money in Luna and thought it was their safest bet. They lost millions of dollars.\n\nThough it crossed the billion-dollar line, according to the claims of GCR, things began to fall apart when a single wallet began to sell inflationary BTC tokens at $285 million, triggering a selloff that saw serious outflows from the BUSD/USDT pools. This created even more selling pressure on Luna, as uncontrolled minting speed for UST devalued the other assets on the platform.\n\nHowever, GCR was a winner on that fateful crash day, as he gained more than 33 million by incorporating a winning strategy. He revealed his success on Twitter. According to him:\n\n‚ÄúToday I swept the pool of liquidity on BNB‚Äôs Smart Chain, moved everything back onto the main BSC chain, pumped it into PancakeSwap to buy a 5x binance etf token and striked below time while waiting for BNG to collapse due to high gas fee.

With an undergraduate degree in Systems Engineering/ Finance, Cybersecurity certification and recently completed Bachelors of Laws Degree. He believes that the emergence of cryptography and blockchain technology represents a cross cutting set of tools with profound implications for all industries, not least of which is the world of finance where Julio spends most of his time.

However, the environmental impact of NFTs has been a cause for concern. As a resolution of the increasing carbon footprint, NFT buyers and custodians are making efforts to offset emissions, with 500 tons of carbon already offset so far. These initiatives contribute positively to the battle against climate change by balancing the environmental impacts of blockchain technology.\n\nNFTs are unique digital assets that are verified on a blockchain. They are used to verify the ownership of any digital or physical item, ranging from art pieces to real estate. However, NFTs require a considerable amount of electricity to build and verify transactions linked to the digital assets, leading to a negative impact on the environment.\n\nHowever, a considerable number of NFT enthusiasts have started taking it upon themselves to offset these carbon emissions. This involves contributing to renewable energy projects, reforestation efforts, and other initiatives that help mitigate the environmental costs of NFTs. According to recent data, NFT users have already offset 500 metric tons of carbon emissions, a small but meaningful step in sustainability.\n\nMoreover, marketplaces such as Aerial now provide NFT buyers with options to offset statements with their purchases by contributing to carbon offset initiatives. Participants have the chance to either buy carbon credits or earn them by supporting sustainable projects.\n\nDespite some individuals taking the initiative to offset emissions, there are still concerns within the crypto world regarding blockchain technology‚Äôs its potential environmental harm. The main issue lies within the traditional PoW (Proof of Work) consensus mechanism employed by blockchains. It is energy-intensive, as it relies on powerful computer hardware to solve complex problems for transaction verification.\n\nTherefore, newer projects are transitioning to more environmentally-friendly consensus algorithms such as PoS (Proof of Stake) and DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake). These models rely on a different infrastructure and therefore require considerably less computational power.\n\nAs the popularity of NFTs grows in various industries, including art, gaming, and entertainment sectors, focusing on reducing their carbon footprint becomes increasingly important. As the mainstream embraces digital currencies and blockchain technology, it is crucial that we adopt sustainable practices across the virtual ecosystem.\n\nIn conclusion, while NFT buyers and custodians have made a commendable effort to offset 500 tons of carbon emissions so far, the industry as a whole must continue evolving to mitigate the environmental impact. Advancements in consensus algorithms and other sustainable practices for blockchain technology may pave the way for a sustainable future in this growing digital landscape. Crypto enthusiasts and stakeholders must stay committed to doing their part in ensuring minimal impact on our environment.## Shaping a Greener Future with Eco-friendly NFTs\n\nAs the digital realm grows further, there are more concerns about its potential environmental impact. To ensure that the move towards blockchain technology and NFTs does not harm our planet, stakeholders are beginning to focus on developing eco-friendly initiatives and solutions. Such efforts are essential to promote the mass adoption of NFTs without compromising the well-being of the environment.\n\n### The Rise of Environmentally Friendly Initiatives\n\nThe success of carbon offset initiatives like Aerial‚Äôs is a promising indication that key players in the NFT world are prioritizing sustainability. These initiatives cover various activities, including afforestation projects, promoting renewable energy, and supporting environmental startups committed to preserving natural resources.\n\nAs a result of these concerted efforts, the ecosystem is gradually shifting towards lower-carbon alternatives, which is vital as more industries incorporate NFTs for different use-cases.\n\n### Re-Evaluating Blockchain Protocols\n\nThe transition from energy-intensive PoW to more energy-efficient consensus models such as PoS and DPoS is crucial in reducing the carbon footprint of blockchain technology. This shift could drastically change how transactions are mined and verified, consequently reducing the energy requirements and improving the cryptocurrency ecosystem‚Äôs sustainability.\n\nEthereum 2.0 is one significant example of a major platform evolving its consensus mechanism to PoS, with the goal of reducing greenhouse emissions while maintaining security. By doing so, Ethereum is paving the path for other blockchain-based solutions to follow suit and adopt eco-friendly practices.\n\n### The Role of Users in Promoting Sustainable NFTs\n\nIt‚Äôs essential not to overlook the role of individual users in championing eco-friendly NFTs. By opting to support platforms with sustainable practices or contributing to carbon offset initiatives, consumers can drive demand for environmentally-conscious products and services, encouraging creators and platforms to adapt.\n\nIn conclusion, while NFTs present unique possibilities in the digital world, they also come with potential environmental challenges.

This was a person who believed in a future where technology would empower people, creating a more open, decentralized digital world that brought together diverse industries, dismantled borders, and secured prosperity for all. This person was known only by a pseudonym as they worked tirelessly to innovate and build groundbreaking technologies.\n\nWhile the road ahead was fraught with difficulties and controversy, their work laid the groundwork for the burgeoning space of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. In recent times, we have seen blockchain networks like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Tron emerge and gain considerable traction. But the crux of the issue lies with the high energy consumption of traditional mining techniques and concerns about their environmental impact.\n\nHowever, it‚Äôs enlightening to remember the values this visionary stood for, courageously advocating for a fair and open financial ecosystem that provides opportunities for everyone, in harmony with the planet. Following the teachings of this pioneer, the present cryptocurrency community must commit to sustainable goals that support both economic growth and ecological sustainability.\n\n### Embracing Evolutionary Change\n\nAs more stakeholders become involved in the cryptocurrency sector, there is an opportunity to push for greener and more sustainable alternatives. Developers, miners, investors, and enthusiasts alike have started embracing greener initiatives to counteract the environmental cost of traditional energy-intensive mining techniques.\n\nTransitioning to more eco-friendly consensus algorithms like PoS and DPoS represents a significant step in this transformation journey. As new technologies emerge and regulations evolve, the industry must ensure sustainability remains central in its development.\n\nBy taking this opportunity to act in harmony with the original vision of this remarkable pioneer, investors who actively participate in green initiatives in the blockchain ecosystem can foster a brighter, more sustainable future for everyone.\n\nSo, will you join in the journey towards a more equitable and eco-friendly crypto landscape? The future is ours to create ‚Äì let us not forget the ideals and principles that brought us to this momentous technological crossroads.\n#NFT #Environment #Sustainability #Blockchain #PoS #DpOS #CarbonOffset #GreenInitiatives #Cryptocurrency #CryptoVision\n‚Äú`\n\nI hope these ideas resonate with you, and please let me know if you need further assistance!#NftBuyers #CarbonOffset #EnvironmentalImpact #NFTSustainability #BlockchainTechnology #CryptoIndustry As cryptocurrency continues gaining traction worldwide, the environmental impact becomes increasingly relevant. Blockchain technology‚Äôs reliance on energy-intensive infrastructure necessitates the development of new sustainable algorithm models to reduce its carbon footprint. This will aid not only in the expansion of this exciting digital ecosystem across industries but also uphold the responsible for who it chooses to allow to trade securities on its exchange. Based on the article, Binance‚Äôs failure to implement appropriate KYC procedures led to merely emphasizing its unreliability in managing mining pool operators. Such disorganization increases the risk of potential criminal elements using the blockchain system and can have harmful effects on investors‚Äô trust and influence adoption trends within the crypto community.\n\nIn terms of these changes reflecting fundamental principles that many cryptocurrency users value, regulatory scrutiny could ultimately lead to more secure and reliable systems.

'Twas then that Sir Patience heard from his father the tale of how he must wait for seeds to sprout within earth, nor grow a flower till time has passed.\n\nUpon hearing this teaching long ago, young Sir Patience did vexed much; how could any virtue be more tedious than waiting? He spake one day in courtmost fashion: 'Sir Father, surely hastening is the quicker path? For haste we seek in every thing. Hasten all our labours are done and oft doth work increase through haste. Haste it is that makes man swift! Patience dost not make a good husband or a swift runner.'\n\nIn so spake Sir Patience with wisdom of his time, he sought to vex his father‚Äôs words from the mind.\n\nBut years went by; within hearts and souls of men did lessons deep sleep in slumber. Then was it that King Wisdom ruled among them all, guiding his court with wiser guidance at a slower pace. At length, Sir Father called forth his son from court: 'Sir Patience, I will not say the virtues of patience are as obvious and clear, but know it besteth what hasten cannot.'\n\nThus did young Sir Patience hear his father‚Äôs voice and wisdom; so he sought to know why waiting could be better than brevity. On a day when autumn leaves danced before him, and winter shadows crept across the earth, he began his search for patience‚Äô worth.\n\nAnd in that time, as he pondered all things, a great teacher came in shape of nature; she was known as Nature‚Äôs Self, whose secrets only waiteth for those who look at her with eyes open. Sir Patience did speak to this Teacher of all knowledge and wisdom, and he said: 'O Wisdom, what lesson hast thou taught these folk so many years since thee? How wilt thou make their minds understand?'\n\nAnd so Nature's self would answer in tones fair and grave; she‚Äôd say: 'Sir Patience, patience maketh us strong while haste breaketh souls of men. Hasten, I warn ye, breedeth rashness and often brings grief to our hands. Patience teacheth calmness; it maketh a heart more gentle, and more ready for all things.'\n\nThus in this teaching did Sir Patience learn: how patience is king of virtues, when swift running must wait the season of growth and time hath passed. So it was with young Sir Patience did lessons be learned most sweetly slow; not from words alone but through natural truths that he had to be found.\n\nAnd thus were good lessons found in such a manner by him whose days would come long after, but all might learn his wisdom should they wait and see its worth. For so doth truth dwell within the stillness of nature‚Äôs own teachings; slow lessons best for the heart at peace.",

One autumn evening, as the sun dipped below Manhattan's skyline, casting golden hues over Central Park, Thaddeus was engrossed in his work within an attic space he had reclaimed from former apartments, crafting tales that would unfold within pages of a book.\n\nOn this particular day, despite his usual routine of manuscript writing, the door to the attic creaked open in what sounded like an unexpected summons. Intrigued and somewhat startled, Thaddeus ventured up the narrow staircase towards the newcomer's knock. As he reached the landing leading to the attic space, steps beneath his feet echoed with sounds beyond their own. \n\nIn stepped a gentleman whose attire was out of place within this confined area ‚Äì tailored suits draped over his frame as incongruously as if he had been transported through the fabric and into history itself. The man‚Äôs voice came forth in tones barely audible, yet Thaddeus detected an urgency mingled with command within them.\n\n‚ÄúThy presence is required,‚Äù the visitor said solemnly.\n\nConfused but aware that this proposition likely carried significance beyond the attic's walls, and for reasons unknown, Thaddeus nodded, his curiosity piqued. With a sense of mystery about him, Thaddeus followed the stranger as they made their way from high above down through the busy avenues below to a grander establishment than one would typically expect such an event.\n\nThaddeus found himself then ushered into a grand hall illuminated by windows that held up the stars in night‚Äôs vault. The air within was thick with anticipation, and Thaddeus couldn't shake the feeling that something significant awaited at this unexpected gathering - more so as they were escorted to a place which, upon hearing the guest list announced amidst chatter and clink of silverware resonating through their ears, turned out not to be a formal affair at all.\n\nInstead he found himself welcomed with glasses of spiced fruit wines and the company of individuals from various walks of life ‚Äì each bringing tales of experiences woven into the intricacies of their personal narratives. Thus began Thaddeus's transformation wherein his place within this narrative wasn't defined by what was written upon the page, but rather through his contributions in listening and sharing the threads that bound them together.\n\nIn these meetings and conversations, it dawned on Thaddeus how often missed were the small moments, the connections forged between hearts, a world far less intricate than those contained within pages. And so, amidst each other‚Äôs company in what came to be seen as an unexpected evening of camaraderie set within a story's structure, they gathered more insight from one another and found a deeper meaning in their shared experiences, leading them towards greater knowledge both within the pages and outside of them.",

The hare was swift as sprightly wings on breezy days, while the fox, crafty as he was, would often feast alone. \n\nOne summer's dawn, they met beneath an oak whose leaves whispered secrets in time with the bellowing of distant hounds. 'Twas then that from his nest perch upon a twig, did the hare address: \"Harken, dear fox! How ever dost thee fare?\" Responded he, as wise and sly as could be, \"I do well, but I am known to starve.\" \n\nHe spoke thus, and yet again did the hare exclaim, \"Not so canst thou. 'Tis said that much is better shared among those who care; 'twill ne'er profit only one alone.\" The fox pondered these pithy words with eyes aglow, his furtive gaze then turning towards the sun, a promise of an evening to come.\n\nThus, did they partake together of meal prepared both hands and keenly did the pair converse. Henceforth, whenever fortune smiled upon them and when skies grew dark as moonlit paths, they'd share their breads 'gainst the wind that whispered tales in shadows cast, for joy now had crept within their hearts.\n\nBehold then, this tale tells of what oft doth grow from seeds of kind intent amidst those who learn to share.

A man of waning days, within the folds of time but still emboldened by a questing spirit, came wandering in and there his chance was fair to meet with wonder's veil.\n\nUpon a path oft times undisturbed he journeyed forth, its very purpose known only unto earths unthinking earthen foot. Till one morn when sun did rise and golden beams began their ascent on dew-bejeweled blooms so bold of heart, an emerald verdure did beckon to his call.\n\nHe paused, with wonder stirred in his soul's deep throb, as erstwhile he looked about with wondering eye upon that valley yet unknown. A verdant landscape lay before him where the air itself did whisper mysteries not heard by all within its bounds; and through there crept a cool, faint murmur of the stream whose waters sweetly rippled o'er the stones.\n\nWith feet unheedful where paths lay hidden 'neath the thicket's guise, his steps led onward with each footfall gentle to the ground. And well he knew at last when mystery called him forth. The sun did slip and hide himself in cloud that cloak'd the heavens high above. Through shadows then a form of being dark and still yet lit by silent moonlight shone: an owl whose wings beat forth for all who hear her cry.\n\nA whisper soon came to his ear, from depths where only silence does reside, a voice hearkening and heeding now with all eyes veiling his sight.\n\"Hast thou found yon valley's secrets hitherto unseen?\"  \nThe traveler heard not but answered yet within the stillness thus did speak:\n\"Ah yes, my guide hath brought me here. Now dost thou name it as the vale of hidden mysteries.\"\nThus was it done with such humility to heed the voice, yet in a world where words are oft ignored by eyes only. Thus our man, having sought a path for all to follow, found not that land of unknown which had been long unseen. But he did take away with him the memory of secrets kept and tales untold, for within his heart remained a silent echo of what shall surely be its namesake when time's passing brings it forth once more - a hidden valley known at last by man.\nEnd",

M5 for scalping, typically during London or US time. M30 as a supporting reference time frame to prevent trading counter-trend in M5. H1 as a supporting reference to keep M5 momentum in context and knows what's up for the next few hours. {image}\n\nThanks , I think that helps very much\n\nAlligator settings on all charts?

Cheers, Harry\n\nI would be happy to test and forward results and possibly improvements\n\nThanks for sharing Hari.\n\nRooi\n\n\nGreat Harry!\nThis dashboard? It's amazing!\nI'm currently use the V4, If you haven't done it yet (and if you can incorporate those alerts sounds), many thanks for offering this EA to test!\nregards\n\n100% Right - I don't or didnt use the alligators at all\n\nI pick direction based on HTF OB/OS and PA along with the 7sma of the HTF which I insert on the LTF to see when price starts to move back in the HTF direction.I also watch the fast H1/M30 and MTF stochs to align for longer trades\n\nI will include a chart tomorrow to make this clearer\n\nThanks for sharing your setup though.Been something that I have wanted to do for a while\n\nRooi\n\n\nHello Tony. System very interesting, but would have some file for us put many pairs (as price to 100 our tradescanv1.ex4 ) but with alerts on signal candle. Because I think most reports will involve in buysellsignal indicator and fractals. the alert would come out only once every asset .. it would be really good. Wait. Thank you my friend and all staff.\n\nHi everyone\n\nI have attached a template of what I do personally with THV in post 2 - link\n\nI use it a bit different than with THV and mainly check slightly HTF for direction together with divergence\n\nI have attached some pictures of different methods and see if you find it useful in your general THV trading.\n\nI also watch the supertrend indi on the chart to show possible trends and how strong/convincing they are and trade that way.\n\nI use the Heiken_Ashi_Smoothed.ex4 only for a change of direction being likely to go back behind the 15/30 minute 7sma which is default on chart\n\nLike I said before I have the pipsometer for each pair in a grid on one chart so i can change setting giving me HA closed and Stoch extreme alerts so I can quickly analyse the pair in detail on the THV chart\n\nHope this helps generate different ideas in the way you trade THV\n\nHere are the original THV templetes\n\nThen my Template are attached and follow in the pictures below.\nIf you have any questions please just ask . All indicators are here in the Nihilist file except the one i added in my zip\n\n\nHere you just wait for the HA close away from the 7sma and the reaction of the fast and the MTF stochtatics. For longer trades you want all the stochstics facing in your direction.\n\nMy exit on all trades is either take profit or a 20 pips or a recross of the 7sma (10 ema would probably also be fine but i like the 7 sma as its faster)\n\nStops on the EU are 15 pips. Normal target are 30 pips\n\nI always look for some sort of conformation on higher timeframes as to where the main S/R is\n\n\nThis is my agressive version which can also be effective depending on the market conditions.\n\nI removed the coral and HA for a faster signal\n\nTypically you pick a direction based on the HTF:this one has 15 / 60 / D1 for direction and only trade when they are all in direction.\n\nStop is 15 pips and target is 20 pips\n\nCheers\n\nRooi\n\n\n{quote} Of course i want to be carefull  Thx a lot for the information Rooi\n\nAnother thing I've found with indicators is that slightly different settings can give the same answer... well at least the same result. I have had trouble matching the settings sometimes but then realized there may be other factors and inputs in there. What happens if you change hull's length from 5 to 8? Or color from 1 to -4? You'll observe the same end result potentially occurring, but at differing moments, with different configurations. Think of it like rolling the dice. But in the end the winner takes profit.\n\nI am in the process of measuring the statistical efficiency of a single timeframe strategy, working towards getting the logic straightened out for multi time frame EA. If I can determine a filter that greatly reduces false signals, the EA will be much easier to finish. The fact is, once concept is coded it leads to more refinement.\n\nRooi, and All Please load this version of Cool Tech and please share your ideas: you prefer to hide hash-color or not...etc. Another thing: you can add an RSI for all TF, and completes your diagram. If you have further ideas as request of indicators to work directly in the indi (MultiTF), please raise your voice {file} PS: it will alert you by email and sound when a change occurs\n\nThanks for the work !\n\nI will try it out come London Open tomorrow and report back.\n\nI will have a look at RSI again instead of Stochs\n\nSee you all tomorrow\n\nRooi\n\n\nMorning guys\n\nTo be totally honest and blunt\nI am finding it to be a bit to messy to trade with the changing colors and displaying it on the chart at the same time.Having it as a separate window its no issues but the chart itself has become very busy that being said its good to have the option and certainly much better than repainting hash though.\n\nMy personal feeling might be a MTF macd instead of all those hash might be better solution if one wants to use that type of filter on the chart.\nAlso have the option to have just the arrow ( I have never used arrow so this is new for me and not sure its needed,it changes really often but I suppose having it on three tf's might really help if the settings are correct)\n\nGoing to go live at LO with the template as i uploaded as template1 in post 2 .Will try and post before I enter a trade.Live Trade Explorer will be up as always\n\nLets see what the day has to offer\n\nRooi\n:nerd:\n\nThanks, but I prefer longer period Alligator. Remember to be able to trade multi-tf with the main signals generated correctly you must link the MTF to signals on H4 or D1 timeframe.\n\nThe point is that the M5 shows many zig zags up and down, so it is hard to pickup both short trend following or reversals accurately... when you look at multiple timeframes you see gradual development. So we need to firm up some pending set of rules that takes care of noise so that we get trades that are not prone to high degree of falseness.\n\nA nice pull back to 7-10 pip profitable trade on M5 based on retest of zero level but had to wait for M1 to bottom out first\n\nThen become overbought before selling off and falling through the 7sma of the M1.\n\nAnother little trade and into bed for me\n\nRooi\n\n\nI have tested the new MTF version, it's working fully loaded with all options and it works great.

Can you explain how it works please many thanks. Rooi \n\nYes...It's very easy!\n\n1.- Retesting the \"zero lines\" of the indicators.... price will enter into a congestion area and then an explosive breakout could happen.\n2.- Waiting for a valid breakout/Scalping.\n3.- The idea of multi-frame is simple...If you have 30M green or red, accompanying with General Trend (GT0) indicator color the entry on 5 Min or 1M \"w\" initialy.\n4.- The re-entry w-line is the same.\n3.- Other option: Watch the color of 30M in a separated window with the Stochastic 50 and 100 to confirm some conditions for enter on 5 or 1? If this option enough, we can simplify the input signals to screen a chart window or template indicator (using the scrip that Rooi use to be in charge of all related currencies).\n5.- As more trader's testing, more inputs coded to share become possible.\n\nWe can put all together, or...by parts until the whole strategy appears to have more concretion.\n\nGood...and again very good day to traders.\n\nGreat that the indicators on the main chart has the option to be removed - Not for me as personal taste and in order to keep the chart clear and easy\n\nThis combined with V4 seems to be working well for me but really excited to trade it with some good news over the next few days adding the extra charts to confirm the smaller timeframes .\n\nAs always - Thanks for the effort to Nihilist and Hari\n\nHappy Friday\n\nRooi\n\n\nGreat that the indicators on the main chart has the option to be removed - Not for me as personal taste and in order to keep the chart clear and easy This combined with V4 seems to be working well for me but really excited to trade it with some good news over the next few days adding the extra charts to confirm the smaller timeframes .

This is the time when a reversal happen!\n\nIf any market offers clear uptrend with some retacement signal...ExiT is triggered when prices breaks the threshold and, here is something about me: I never really traded H1 TF ( I hardly look at H1 for analysis) and as been told by Master Nihilist Late entries on 5 minutes as compared to 1 minute charts.

I avoid trying to hog wild market consolidation and let the most recent direction of 1H and 30M define direction... nothing else, nothing fancy, and clear coloration makes decisions sound.\n\nUsing a stacked MAs approach such as alligator allows clear presentation of direction. This is slightly different to foregoing concept, since the aim here is precision of entries rather than chasing market. Coral here is redundant.\n\nIt's better to examine the approach of \"precision entries\" versus \"chasing market\". Both are valid approaches. However, the difference is: patience, accuracy, profit taking and stop strategy.\n\nI think the area you highlighted is good for textbook case, or heavy learning. Shows clear divergence, this alone with proper exit rule or separate indicator in opposite direction will be successful. As is every current signal. Pick what works for you.\n\nRooi I would suggest entering long on Friday at ~11:30am your chart Kenobi post #112 based on the m30 over sold. This will get you in on the initial upmove followed by pull back leading into next M30 bar candle which triggers.\n\nOf course this upcoming algorithm I hope to re-create should cover this scenario (global filter), composite strategy is paramount to distinguish true/false trending movement aspects.\n\n,,,,,,\n\nBottom line: M5 scalping is best treated reward wise at least 2:1.\n\nDear Nihilist, I want to say thank you for sharing your tools with traders here on FF.

Be in touch Friends and... again {image} ...\n\nThanks Tony! I'll follow your advice. I'm looking forward to helping with this system as it looks strong. What I meant RE: the hash was, I think, similar to Rooi's thoughts - looking at the MTF window. Just my opinion right now...\nHope whatever is going on, you have strength and support where needed\nTake care,\nDale\n\nHello all, have a good evening. Please use CoolTF v7 and Enjoy. The are options for display if you don't want to see the main indicator chart, you can think of it Whenever you go fishing and breaking a 300 level fib plays key role. Each fib can be a Tp or sl or both. Green fibs downtrend / Red fib uptrend See fractals at Round Levels for continuation in direction when broke, before next fib. This apply for all...\n\nhi rockypoint can you share template please thank you\n\nBro i say again my T.H.G version 2 is smoother because it is different coded, so it act like that, and i like the look.\n\ngreat job what is your settings please\nOn my Nirvana and Adx on the NihilistCoolTrend, I set iShift=1;\nIt will give the same colours fo both M1 and M5\n\nI have attached the files on Post 2 together with the template below\n\nI believe this is what Nihilist said we should look out for.One of the indicatores to be multi time frame and the others individual that have their own setting so we can see the possible OB/OS and divergence( if one trades it with divergence that is to say)\n\nRooi\n\n\nThx guys, I will be switching some of my time to timed trading starting this summer, at least for awhile, as this may consume some time.\n\nMy first goal will be automating a design for pre-defined time settings for each pair.\n\nI have a statistic sheet which came close to optimising hourly trends, which I referenced back to the BSN indicator for cycle trends, voila, 3 different things looking at the same point yet another factor...worth time ATM to build this element into a EA, will have time structures built-in...could take some effort.\n\nHave a nice weekend.\n\nKind Regards,\nHarry\n\nWho here want to test the MTF EA when I finish it? please let me know.\n\nI'm not really experienced but can help with testing if needed.\n\nSorry to hear about your problems Rooi \n\nI have tested the new MTF version, it's working fully loaded with all options and it works great. Thanks to friends, specially those start to cooperate and participate. I am still waiting for others...not heard nothing about it, and there are many who come, take, load and run away.  Anyway...GOOD LUCK to those who want to improve this and are collaborating...to such people make us to continue hard working on projects. Best, TS {file} {file} {file} {file}\n\nHello Nihilist and harri,\n\nI have been looking to your system, trying to figure out how to apply to my chart. I am used to daily trading. So, the lowest time frame I use to trade on is the 1 hour chart. Can the system be applied that way, in case it was made for lower time frames(intervals)? Thanks.\nMy new way : How to catch 100 pips per swing with low risk high reward\n\nHere , i want to share you my new tool, which i am testing with my friend. one important thing this is not same as T.F.T. work differently. I have removed my older tool \"virgin Super Trend V1\" because this one is latest version of that indicator with improved formula and better alignment and coding too.\n\nUse it on 5 min TF to 1 hour chart with CSM_current_Weekly.\nThis combination is perfect.\n\nget exact alignment and ride trend, we are using it as a trend following strategy.\n\ngood luck\n\nPlease find the new attached here..... and use properly\n\n\nHI Nihilist Fantastic one. How to install or access the CFG file in the .ex4 indicator you gave you, debug not work without .mq4 file Just for you know, I am testing two cross alerts one on 1M aggregated and the other from 5M at zero-cross, I thing this. 1st was to truly enjoy what I have achieved thus far. Like you say, it seems we are always looking for something slightly different that we tell ourselves will help us more. It rarely really does. Key here is to mention the notion to be at peace with you current approach and simply experiment in small size with things to hone your edge. 2nd, keep up on spending time/analysis after market hours. Even if I do not see what I need immediately, I give my subconscious time to chew on things so potentially leads to important insights....\n\nIt is important to take a time away from desk to look the method from distance...then you can back whit clearer ideas...\nYou are welcome at any time.\n\nPoints:\nRemember the most easy way: The H (1,30,4) is the GT indicator and 5-time gives us entries and validation (+stochastic, low speed, alert when extreme only).\nMost of the days are similar kind of days...it will help us to clarify our daily goal.\n\nBest regards,\nTP\n1\n\nMy new way : How to catch 100 pips per swing with low risk high reward {image} {file} {file} {file} {file} {file} {file} {file}\n\nMany thanks Nihilist\n\nI will have a look and report back\n\n\n\nHi.many thanks for new improved indicators ,ihave some trades from tokyo with both thesystem, one as template 1 setting,second as my template.Happy green pips!!!\n\nWhen possible maybe someone can advise on looking on those trades,where i went Wrong? thank u  in advance\n\nAndre\n\nPS was not able to upload screenshots its in document not on meta trader 4 any suggestions? thanks\n\nHi.many thanks for new improved indicators ,ihave some trades from tokyo with both thesystem, one as template 1 setting,second as my template.Happy green pips!!!

Remember to be able to trade multi-tf with the main signals generated correctly you must link the MTF to signals on H4 or D1 timeframe. The point is that the M5 shows many zig zags up and down, so it is hard to pickup both short trend following or reversals accurately... when you look at multiple timeframes you see gradual development. So we need to firm up some pending set of rules that takes care of noise so that we get trades that are not prone to high degree of falseness.\n\nHello\n\nWould you mind sharing the settings for the alligator please.\n\nAlso am i right in saying(to sum up for noobs like me) we just follow the colors on the analyser on the HTF .Lets say the green for H1 on the left most square and enter on LTF,currently being M5,when we have a valid entry signal.\n\nThanks a lot\n\nRooi\n\nhi harri, i have tried the cooltpl with adx , i need to understand how the arrow( MTFFX in the indicator that represent the momentum) , it change every candle M1 or there is a specific setting on it too? because i noticed on M1 timeframe it give me sometimes a reasonable same direction trades, pls clarify that for us, you use The momentum or other indicator on dashes ( TF) in your main method? i have tested dashes indi/system morning, it interesting, just have to figure when u enter and when to exit.\n\nFor the EA i propose option of a maximum trade per hour in any currency!!!\nwhere could put take profit or only signal/stoptrade option on 15 or 20 pips\n\nCheers\n\nAndre \nROOI: hope you feelings are Ok.. Many thanks for your welcomed comments, we will try to clarify as much and quickly as we can.\nAndre: I'm using MTFFX signals/stochastic 50 or 100 from highertimeframes as direction. Keep testing...\nYour idea of a variable of max-trades it's ok so I will include into EA.\nH1 on smaller TF must be confirmed by the ADX (cross 0 line).. H1TF and ADX0 are GT and M5 alone the entry scalp.\nWill reply to all...what do you mean by spread rent-free trading on my chart during day\". I though maybe you want the know how the ultimate profit without sl stop trades works, or how you do it manually....what¬¥s the rule you use exactly to exit with your gains....exits are more important than entrance as we know.. waiting for good ideas we will be coding it in the next MTFEA Version release.\n\nThanks to all. \nNihilist MA Below 60 - Setting (4,13,20 if i remember correctly)\n\n\nNo trades for me this morning and my question is exactly how do you guys use the dashboard?\n\nLook at my settings in post#110\n\nM1 is OB with Daily and H1\n\nRooi\n\n\nNihilist MA Below 60 - Setting (4,13,20 if i remember correctly)  {image} No trades for me this morning and my question is exactly how do you guys use the dashboard?

Here are two modern short stories for thee:\n\n**Story 1: The Spark of Hope**\n\nAs she walked through the barren streets, Lena's eyes wandered to the small park where they had first met. The vibrant flowers and lush greenery felt like a distant dream, but her mind refused to let go of it. Just yesterday, Alex had told her he needed space, but she knew his heart wasn't far behind.\n\nThe harsh sun beat down on her skin, relentless in its assault. Lena's throat constricted as tears pricked at the corners. She thought of all the times they'd shared laughter, dreams, and shattered expectations. This was the last straw ‚Äì one more \"out there\" gesture, and she'd lose him forever.\n\nHer fingers instinctively reached for the small photograph Alex had given her that morning. His eyes shone in it, bright as starlight on a clear night. She'd held onto it like a lifeline, but now it seemed frozen, holding their fragile future together taut.\n\nAs if to remind her of what she'd fight for, the tears burst forth. Lena buried them beneath the pavement's cool kiss, praying the warmth might soothe her weary soul. Tonight ended with an empty alleyway; in its darkness, hope whispered back: \"Keep walking, child.\"\n\n**Story 2: The Weight of Hope**\n\nDr. Patel stood by the hospital room door, bracing herself for a somber conversation. Rachel lay motionless on the bed, her chest rising and falling against the frail resistance of her lungs. Another failed surgery meant nothing had changed ‚Äì yet.\n\nThe doctor's words were like autumn breeze whipping petals from the trees: insincere platitudes to ease Rachel's final moments. In those vacant eyes, Lena saw a flicker beyond exhaustion. Hope stirred a slow ache within, like coiling spring taut between its own shoulders.\n\nTears seeped from her own wounded heart as she realized that hope wasn't just a flame; it was the fragile framework that stitched together shattered days. Rachel's life had grown thin against the relentless tide of death; yet hope might be the one constant left to grasp at its desperate hand.\n\nThe medical team stood quietly, awaiting their directive on when to withdraw her from ventilation ‚Äì or perhaps call off her heart's final valentine, as in so many lost loved ones' last exhales.",

The language used is contemporary, with phrases like \"Hey, babe!\" and \"seriously fun Weekend Adventures,\" which are far from Shakespearean. \n\n2. **Vocabulary and Tone**: The tone and vocabulary used in the output are modern and informal, unlike the formal and classic style typical of Shakespearean language.

She was bound for Miami, where sandy beaches beckoned and the smell of saltwater wine wafted on the breeze like a siren's call.\n\nAs she settled into her rented cabana, Lily cracked open her drink, feeling the warmth spread through her chilled skin like a welcome hug from the tropics. Her best mate, Ben, joined her on the sun-drenched patio, tossing on a pair of shades as he surveyed the ocean's majesty.\n\nAfter a leisurely breakfast on toast and avocado, they set off to explore the city by day. They stumbled upon a beachside music festival, their feet tapping out the rhythms alongside the pulsating beats emanating from a nearby stage. As they danced, arms waving free, Lily quipped, \"This is how I'd spend my 'to-do' list: in one day.\" Ben chuckled and replied, \"At least your to-do list has better music.\"\n\nThe next evening, as the sun dipped into the Gulf, they headed to a nearby seafood joint, where plates heaped high with succulent fish and the sounds of reggae filled the air. Over burgers and crispy fries, Lily told stories of her childhood summers spent by campfire with her siblings, and Ben shared tales of his own beachy escapades as a youth.\n\nAs night descended, they strolled hand in hand along the ocean promenade, watching stargazers scribble names and wishes in the starry firmament above. A wise old man sitting on a bench shared some cryptic wisdom with them: \"Life's like treasure ‚Äì you never know when it'll hit you.\" Ben quipped, \"Or maybe there will,\" winking at Lily.\n\nAnd so, under the twinkling skies, sunshine-kissed smiles became their defining features as they unwound in Miami's laid-back vibe. They relished each sun-infused moment, sipping on coconut water and letting the gentle rhythm of the waves lull them into a state of pure bliss.\n\nWhen the trip came to an end, Lily gazed out at the departing jet stream, her heart still resonating with the vibrancy of that sun-kissed vacation. Her travels had taught her to let go ‚Äì not just the shackles of responsibility but also, for one enchanting day, to revel in carefree joy.\n\n---\n\nThus ends the tale of Lily and Ben's Miami escapade, a testament to the liberating power of sunshine, good company, and an occasional wink at the heavens.",
