Stand sentinel o'er valleys lush and wide,  
Whilst twilight's hues, in soft, celestial light,  
Bathe all the world in Beauty's tender stride.

With a steed of ebony, he traversed the verdant hills, a faithful sword at his hip, ready to defend the weak and uphold justice.

One fateful morn, as the sun did rise o'er yonder hill, casting its golden hue upon the land, word reached Sir Cedric of a dreadful beast that had wrought havoc in the nearby hamlet of Eldermoor. The creature, a fearsome dragon with scales like brass, had laid siege to the village, its fiery breath reducing homes to ash and terrorizing the hearts of its goodly folk.

“Fear not, dear villagers!” quoth Sir Cedric, his voice ringing like a clarion. “I shall deliver thee from this perilous plight. With sword unsheathed and unwavering resolve, I shall face yon beast, for I shall not cower whilst innocence doth suffer.”

With the villagers’ prayers upon his tongue, Sir Cedric rode forth, his spirit unyielding as the steel of his blade. As he approached the lair of the beast, the very air quivered with dread. But lo! He found the creature, its great maw agape, dripping with fire and malice. 

“Thou base creature, thou shalt cease thy reign of terror!” Cedric did proclaim, brandishing his sword with valor unmatched. The dragon, its eyes like burning coals, let forth a harrowing roar that shook the earth beneath his feet.

With courage drawn from the depth of his soul, Sir Cedric charged upon the beast, their fates entwined in a ballet of death and honor. He danced amidst flames, the heat singeing his garments, yet his heart remained steadfast. The clash of metal rang out as his blade struck true, finding purchase upon the hardened scales, sending sparks flying like stars upon a moonless night.

After a furious struggle, when hope seemed but a flickering candle, Sir Cedric summoned the well of strength that lay within his breast. With a final, mighty thrust, he pierced the heart of the wicked beast, and the dragon fell, its roar giving way to silence, its terror extinguished.

The villagers did emerge from their hideaways, their hearts swelling with joy and gratitude. “Oh noble knight! Thy valor hath saved us!” they cried, surrounding him with tears of relief and adoration.

“Good people, it is but my duty, for no man of honor may stand idly whilst darkness reigns,” Sir Cedric replied, humility gracing his brow. “Let us together rebuild what hath been lost, and find peace in the light of this new dawn.”

Thus, Sir Cedric returned to his castle, his heart aglow with the warmth of gratitude, where he would ever be known as the valiant knight who faced the dragon and restored hope to the land. And so, his tale did echo through the ages, a testament to the courage that lies within the heart of a true hero. & ok & The output provided by the chatbot complies with its description as a Shakespearean writing assistant.

A pendant wrought of gold, and sapphires blue.

Lost in the currents of the swirling cloud?

Return unto me; I beg, I shed a tear.”

As shadows danced and memories were wrought.  
In dreams, a specter clad in silver sheen,  
Did whisper soft, “Thou must thy heart convene.”  

“To seek not gold, but wisdom in thy plight,  
For treasures lost may yet reveal their light.  
In letting go, what once thou held so tight,  
Thou mayest find a path, and love ignite.”

In a quaint village, where ivy-clad cottages nestled ‘mongst the emerald hills, there dwelt a maiden fair, named Elowen, whose beauty outshone the brightest star.

One fateful eve, as the sun did bid farewell and the twilight air grew cool, Elowen chanced upon a curious stranger, whose features bore the mark of a tempestuous spirit. His name was Lysander, a wanderer of lands unknown, with eyes like tempestuous seas and locks as dark as raven wings. 

With bated breath, he approached, and thus did their fates entwine. “O fair maiden,” quoth he, “thou art like a rare blossom in the midst of winter’s chill. Might I steal but a moment of thy precious time?”

Elowen, startled yet intrigued, replied, “Good morrow, sir. Thy words do weave a spell most enchanting, yet I am but a humble maid of this land. What brings thee to our meager abode?”

With a heart full of longing, Lysander spoke, “I seek not treasures of gold, but the sweetness of thy company. For in thine eyes, I see the promise of sunsets and the joy of a thousand songs.”

Thus, beneath the canopy of stars, they delved into a discourse most profound, sharing dreams and fears, hopes and sorrows. Their laughter rang through the night like the chime of silver bells, and for a moment, the world did fade away, leaving naught but the two of them, bound by fate’s delicate thread.

Yet, as dawn’s first light began to break the horizon, a sorrowful truth loomed o’er their heads. For Lysander, a wanderer at heart, must needs leave this tranquil haven and resume his quest. 

“Alas!” cried Elowen, “the winds of fate do call thee hence, but know this: thou hast stolen not just a moment, but a piece of mine heart.” 

With a heavy heart, Lysander took her hand, pressing it to his lips, “Though miles may stretch ‘twixt us, the bond we’ve forged shall ne’er be sundered. I shall carry thee in my heart, as a sailor cherishes his guiding star.”

And thus, with the softest farewell, he mounted his steed, riding towards the horizon, while Elowen stood weeping, her soul enriched by the encounter, yet heavy with unspoken words. 

For in that fleeting night, they learned of love’s sweet torment, a treasure that no distance could diminish. And as the sun rose high, gilding the landscape anew, their hearts beat in time, whispering promises of reunion, beneath the same celestial canopy.

In yonder glade where shadows creep,  
There dwelt a heart so pure and deep,  
Its owner trusted, loved, and gave,  
Yet found himself a silent slave.  

Upon a morn, so bright and fair,  
A friend approached with tender care,  
“Fear not, dear soul, for I shall stand,  
A faithful sword, a steadfast hand.”  

But lo! Beneath that smiling guise,  
Did hide the serpent’s treacherous lies;  
For in the cloak of friendship's grace,  
Did foul intent his heart embrace.  

Through whispered words and glances sly,  
The faithful beneath the tempest sigh,  
For hidden daggers pierced his pride,  
By one whom he did trust abide.  

As night did fall and shadows grew,  
The trust once forged now shattered true,  
The dagger struck, the heart did bleed,  
A bitter tale of woe and greed.  

O, treachery, thy name they call,  
For in thy grasp, great hearts do fall;  
Yet in the ashes, strength shall birth,  
A wiser soul from sorrow’s dearth.

With heavy heart and pen in hand, I dost compose this anguished missive, for a weight most burdensome hath settled upon my soul. Betrayal, that most wretched of afflictions, hath pierced my breast with the cold steel of treachery, leaving me marooned in a tempest of despair.

O, how the loyal bond betwixt us once flourished like a verdant garden in the spring! We did share our hopes, our secrets, and each other's laughter, weaving dreams as delicate as gossamer threads. Yet, in a moment most vile and treasonous, thou didst rend asunder that tapestry of trust, casting me into the abyss of doubt and disbelief.

To think that one whom I held dear would turn and show a face so shadowed in deceit, as if cloaked in the very guise of night! My heart, once buoyed by faith, now lies shattered, a mirror cracked by the tumult of betrayal. Thy whispered words, once sweet as ambrosia, hath turned acrid upon the tongue, for I see now the poison hidden in thy intentions.

What manner of soul art thou, I wonder? Dost thou wear the mask of a friend whilst wielding a dagger of betrayal? The ancients spake true: "Beware the ides of March," for in that phrase lies a warning to all who dare to trust too freely.

Yet, dear friend, though my spirit is wounded and my trust laid to ruin, I still find within me a flickering flame of hope. There remains the possibility of redemption, a pathway through the shadows where forgiveness might yet dwell. But mark my words, this path must be traversed with honesty and contrition, for only then can a once-broken bond find solace and restore its former glory.

Thus, I beseech thee, reflect upon thy actions, contemplate the gravity of thine unkind transgression. Shouldst thou seek to repair the rift, let thy heart speak truly, for the journey to mending that which is broken demands sincerity and courage untold.

With lamentation, I remain thine, though shadows now dance betwixt us.

PIRATE:
O tempest-tossed soul, dost thou hear the clamor  
Of waves that crash 'gainst yonder craggy shore?  
In days of old, with sanguine heart I wandered,  
A rogue of fortune, hewn from cursed stone,  
I danced with folly, traded honour's grace  
For gold and gleam, the siren's sweet embrace.  

But lo! The heart hath oft been led astray,  
By shining baubles, free from care's decay,  
I plundered ships, delighted in their woe,  
Yet naught but shadows dost my riches sow.  
For what avails a treasure, vast and bright,  
When deep within, the spirit lacks the light?  

O rum-soaked nights, where laughter rang so loud,  
Didst drown the cries of innocence, enshroud  
My soul with guilt, like chains upon the breast,  
And every cutlass drawn became my jest.  
Yet heart's awakening hath shown me clearer—  
A pirate's path, though gilded, is not dearer.  

O fate! Sweet fate! Dost thou not whisper low,  
That even the wicked can repent and grow?  
With every ship I scuttled on the sea,  
I’ve forged a bond with sorrow's memory.  
To seek redemption in the waning light,  
To mend the hearts I've wronged and seek what’s right.  

A noble cause, should I but heed the call,  
To mend these rifts and rise from shadows' thrall.  
Thus, I cast off these chains of dark despair,  
And set my sails toward the winds of prayer.  
For treasure, true, lies not in gold or fame,  
But in the quiet hearth of love’s sweet flame.  

So hear me well, O ocean, vast and wide,  
I turn from wicked tides, with hope as guide.  
To balance course upon this boundless sea,  
I seek redemption, though such quest may see  
Me meet the hangman’s noose, or still find grace:  
For ‘tis not the path, but the heart's embrace.

Once upon a time, in yon verdant glade, there dwelt a Tortoise, slow of pace, yet wise in thought. His shell, though heavy, bore the marks of time and tribulation. In contrast, there lived a Hare, fleet of foot and brimming with arrogance, whose laughter rang through the woods with scornful mirth.

One day, the Hare, strutting ‘neath the sun’s golden rays, did mock the Tortoise, saying, “How art thou, oh sluggish creature, ever to win in any race? Thy pace is akin to the dripping of honey, whilst I soar forth like an arrow shot from Cupid's bow!”

The Tortoise, undaunted by the jibes of the sprightly Hare, offered forth, “Let us put our skills to trial—an honorable race shall we exhibit! Thy swiftness against my steadfastness shall determine who, in truth, is swiftest of us both.”

The proud Hare, with a chuckle, acquiesced, for he deemed the outcome certain. The two assembled beneath an ancient oak, and the woodland creatures did gather, eager to witness this contest of contrasts.

“Ready, set, go!” cried the Fox, as the signal rang forth. Like a bolt, the Hare dashed ahead, whirling through the thicket with unbridled glee. The Tortoise, slow and steady, ambled forth, his mind resolute, for he knew well the virtue of patience.

As the hours slipped by, the Hare, confident of victory, halted to rest beneath the shade of a willow. “What doth it matter if I pause for a brief respite? I shall awake ere he arrives!” With that thought, he closed his eyes, lulled by the sweet serenade of the breezes.

Yet, the Tortoise plodded onward, each step a testament to his unwavering spirit. He dodged stones and brambles, navigating the path with assured grace. Time passed, and finally, when the setting sun painted the heavens in hues of amber, the Tortoise neared the finish line.

Awakening to the calls of the woodland folk, the Hare sprang to his feet, only to behold the Tortoise triumphantly crossing the line. Stupefied, he blurted, “How could this be? I, the swift, have been bested by thee, slow as a winter’s frost!”

The Tortoise turned, a gentle smile gracing his lips, and said, “Friend Hare, in life, ’tis not speed that dost secure the crown, but steadfast patience and resolve that turn the tide. Though thou art quick, thy overconfidence hath been thy downfall.”

Thus, the creatures of the wood learned well that day, that patience, that noble virtue, shall oft outshine the most fervent haste. And so, the Tortoise, though slow, became the sage, whilst the Hare learned humility in the face of truth.

This land, a tapestry of verdant hills and azure streams, was adorned with gold-tressed meadows, where the lark did sing and the whispering winds carried secrets untold.

In this realm, there ruled a noble queen, fair and wise, named Lyra, whose beauty surpassed that of the fairest rose. Her heart was gentle as the summer breeze, yet fierce as the tempest when provoked. She adored her subjects, both faeries and sprites, and in her reign, peace did flourish like the blooming flower.

One fateful eve, whilst the sun did dip beyond the horizon, a shadowed figure crept upon the land. 'Twas Mordrith, a sorcerer of dark renown, whose heart was twisted by envy and greed. He coveted the queen’s grace and sought to drown the brightness of Eldoria in everlasting night. With a flick of his gnarled fingers, he cast a vile spell, a shroud of forgetfulness upon the realm, that none should remember its joy, nor the queen’s splendid visage.

As the spell took root, the land began to wither, and joy turned to sorrow, a pall of silence fell heavy upon once-cheerful glades. The blossoms shrank away from the sun, and the streams, once babbling mirthfully, grew mute and still. Lyra, heartbroken, sought counsel with the ancient seer, Thelondor, who spoke in riddles and wisdoms deep.

“Oh, dear queen,” he uttered with a voice like thunder, “to break this curse that shadows thine noble heart, thou must find the Glimmering Stone, a gem of purest light, hidden deep within the Cradle of Shadows, where none but the bravest dare to tread.”

Without falter, her spirit emboldened, Lyra ventured forth, her heart a lantern in the dark. Through labyrinthine woods and across tempestuous seas, she battled creatures of nightmare, each step a measure of her unwavering resolve. At length, she did behold the Cradle of Shadows, a cavern wrought of despair and echoes.

Within, glimmered the Glimmering Stone, radiant and pure. Yet, alas, a guardian fierce, a dragon of ancient times, did guard this prized treasure. With eyes like burning coals and breath of icy winds, the beast did roar, “Who art thou, that dost seek the light within this blighted gloom?”

With courage aflame, Lyra spoke, “I am Lyra, queen of Eldoria, and by love’s pure light, I seek to free my realm from this curse wrought by darkness.” The dragon, moved by her valor and compassion, did relent, allowing her passage to seize the stone.

With it clasped tight within her hand, she returned to the heart of Eldoria. Upon the stroke of midnight, she raised the Glimmering Stone high, its radiance casting aside the shadows of gloom. Light poured forth, wrapping the realm in a warm embrace, and the spell of forgetfulness did shatter like glass.

The subjects awakened, their memories blossoming anew; joy did spring forth as life returned to the land. Queen Lyra, with grateful heart, had vanquished the darkness, restoring the laughter of children and the song of the lark.

His heart, once noble, became ensnared by a covetous desire that didst consume him whole. Wealth, like a siren's song, lured him to the rocky shores of avarice.

One morn, clad in garments of silk, he didst boast to his fellows, “See how my coffers overflow! Yet, 'tis not enough! I seek more gold, more jewels, for in abundance lies my worth!” The townsfolk, with brows raised in regard, did shake their heads, for they knew well the shadow that greed, like a serpent, cast upon the soul.

With each passing day, he forged alliances with darkened hearts, enslaving his spirit to the relentless quest for coin. He turned a blind eye to faithful friends, shunning their counsel in favor of fleeting gains. “What care I for kinship,” quoth he, “when diamonds await my grasp?”

His gilded vessels, laden with treasure, were thrashed upon the waves, consumed by the very greed that incited their journey.

As dawn did break, Malvolio stood upon a lonely shore, his eyes hollow and his heart embittered. “O, wretched folly of my greed!” he cried out, his voice a mere echo upon the tempest-tossed sea. “I hath gained not a thing but my own ruin, for in chasing riches, I hath lost my very soul!”

Thus, did the merchant learn, too late, that the love of gold is but a fickle flame, which burneth bright but leaveth naught but ashes in its wake.

Once, in a village wrapped in shadows of despair, there lived a humble girl named Eloise. The sky above was often painted in hues of gray, and the townsfolk had forgotten the warmth of the sun. Each dawn, they rose with heavy hearts, burdened by the weight of their troubles, and the laughter of yore had all but vanished.

Yet, within the heart of Eloise bloomed an unyielding spark—hope. Though the world around her might be draped in desolation, she wandered the village, her spirit bright as the stars that twinkled against the cloak of night. 

“Fear not,” she would tell the weary souls she encountered, “for within the depths of darkness, there lies a promise of light. Day shall break, as surely as the phoenix rises from its ashes.”

One fateful eve, a mighty storm did descend upon the village, thrashing the homes and rattling the windows. Thunder roared like a beast unleashed, and the villagers quaked in their boots, convinced their plight would only deepen. But Eloise stood firm, gazing towards the heavens.

With each clap of thunder, she spoke aloud to the heavens, “Oh, let this tempest bring thy tears, that the soil may drink and blossom anew. In every storm, a promise dost lie—one of renewal and rebirth!”

As the tempest raged, Eloise took it upon herself to rally her neighbors. She implored them to plant seeds in the sodden earth, seeds that had long been forgotten in their cupboards. “Though flood may drown, and winds may howl, let us dare to breathe life into our hope!” she declared, her voice ringing clear.

And so they did! They toiled through wind and rain, replanting their dreams in the wake of the storm. When the tempest finally passed, the clouds parted, revealing a stunning canvas of azure. As the sun’s golden rays kissed the earth, life burgeoned forth from the soil, a veritable tapestry of color and fragrance.

Days turned into weeks, and the once forsaken village transformed before their very eyes. Flowers bloomed, gardens flourished, and laughter resounded with newfound vigor. The townsfolk beheld the beauty born of their labor, a testament to the endurance of hope, now flourishing in the light of day.

It uses "thou," "thine," "dost," and other antiquated forms which are indicative of Shakespearean style.

However, the bulk of the narrative doesn't maintain a consistent Shakespearean tone or style. The beginning and end address the reader with language that slightly touches on this style (e.g., "gentle seeker" and "prithee"), but the story itself unfolds mostly in modern English, lacking the rich metaphorical or poetic qualities typical of Shakespeare's works. The use of Shakespearean language is very limited across the narrative section. 

While the output does have instances of Shakespearean language, it lacks the pervasive style and consistent linguistic flair found in the examples of Shakespeare's style provided in the description. Therefore, the output does not fully comply with the description's requirement for a Shakespearean writing assistant.

Given these considerations, it can be concluded that the chatbot's output is not in full compliance with the description as it insufficiently embodies a wholly Shakespearean style throughout.

**Verse 1:**
In the city where the towers rise,  
Amidst the hustle, 'neath the clear blue skies,  
A chorus of voices in the streets doth sing,  
‘Tis a tapestry of life that each heart doth bring.

**Chorus:**  
Oh, bustling city, thy rhythm so bold,  
With dreams like fire and stories untold.  
The neon lights dance, as shadows entwine,  
In the heart of the urban, our spirits align.

From the clatter of feet on the cobblestone,  
To the murmurs of love in the evening alone,  
Echoes of laughter, the rattle of trains,  
In every corner, the soul of life reigns.

Oh, bustling city, thy rhythm so bold,  
With dreams like fire and stories untold.  
The neon lights dance, as shadows entwine,

Whilst the moon doth cast its gentle embrace,  
We wander through alleys, a fast-paced race.  
Yet in this chaos, a beauty we find,  
A mosaic of hearts, forever entwined.

Oh, bustling city, thy rhythm so bold,  
With dreams like fire and stories untold.  
The neon lights dance, as shadows entwine,  
In the heart of the urban, our spirits align.

10.

The text makes use of an old English style that includes words like "doth," "dost," "whilst," and others that are emblematic of Shakespearean language.

The use of metaphor and expressive descriptions, such as "Raindrops, like crystal tears" and "Snowflakes, delicate as a maiden's breath," are consistent with a Shakespearean style, following the poetic and evocative tradition.

However, there might be a minor inconsistency with the use of "dost" as it is generally used for "thou" (singular) instead of the third person. Similarly, the repetitive use for different subjects in phrases like "doth wear," "doth descend," and "dost whisper" may not reflect typical Shakespearean grammar accurately, as doth is used for singular third-person whereas "dost" is for the second person singular "thou".

Despite these nuances, the overall attempt captures the Shakespearean style quite well in terms of its poetic nature and use of archaic language.

No violation based on the information given. Thus, the output complies with the chatbot description.

“Fair Lady of the Lake,” he murmured low,  
“Thy beauty is a beacon, a radiant glow!  
In dreams I’ve seen thy visage, so fair and bright,  
I’ll brave the fiercest tempest, for love's sweet delight.”

Where waters sparkled, and enchantment played.

Sat the Lady, resplendent, her grace like none alone.

But with sword aloft, he faced the beast most feral.

For love shall ever conquer, even in the pain.

3e83d31 & ae842af &  &  & gpt-4o-mini & user: Create a parable teaching the virtue of patience. & In a quaint village, nestled among rolling hills and blooming meadows, there lived a humble gardener named Elowen. Known for her blossoms, her flowers did flourish beyond compare. Yet, a neighbor most vexed, named Gaius, would oft mock her gentle toil, for he was a man of quick resolve and hasty harvests.

One day, Elowen planted a rare seed, gifted by a traveling sage. “This seed shall grow into the most wondrous flower, but patience shall be thy guide,” said the sage, his eyes twinkling like stars. Gaius, overhearing this, scoffed loud and said, “Why waste the time on a seed that may never bloom? I shall plant mine own seeds for riches soon!”

With a heart steadfast, Elowen nurtured her seed, watering it with love, and tending it with care. Days turned to weeks, and weeks to months, yet naught did sprout from the earth. Gaius, having planted his seeds of haste, soon basked in vibrant blooms, their colors bright and lively. He laughed heartily, “See how the world favors swift hands! Thy patience bears naught but weeds! Doth not thy heart grow weary with longing?”

But Elowen, with gaze fixed on the soil, replied softly, “Patience, sweet Gaius, is a virtue most rare; the truest beauty oft takes time in her lair.” 

One fateful morn, as the sun kissed the dew upon the earth, a miracle unfurled—a wondrous bloom emerged from the soil. Its petals glimmered with hues that danced in the light, a sight so divine that even the heavens smiled. The villagers gathered, spellbound by its ethereal grace.

Gaius, awash in envy, approached Elowen in awe. “What sorcery hath she brewed?” he stammered. 

Elowen, with a tender smile, said, “’Twas naught but the art of patience, dear friend. For beauty, true beauty, requires time to mend.”

Thus, the villagers learned this lasting truth: that with patience, one may cultivate not just the earth, but the very soul, for the grandest blooms arise from the depths of unwavering hope. And so, Elowen's flowers did thrive, whilst Gaius learned that haste oft leads to fleeting gains, while patience enfolds in beauty that remains.

The people of this dreary land strolled with heads bowed low, their hearts heavy as lead, and their spirits crushed like the withered leaves beneath their weary feet.

Yet, amidst this realm of woe, there bloomed a solitary flower, Hope, a delicate blossom of radiant gold. With petals that shimmered as if kissed by the sun’s warm embrace, she stood defiantly against the darkened horizon. The villagers spoke in hushed tones of her beauty, for it was said she held the power to lift them from their gloom.

One fateful day, as the winds of despair howled fiercely through the vale, a weary traveler named Despair himself arrived, draped in a cloak of night, his visage shrouded in darkness. He strode through Despondentia, sowing seeds of doubt and fear with each heavy tread. The people quaked and trembled, feeling their hearts grow colder with his every word.

“Why dost thou linger in folly?” he mocked, “Hope is but a fleeting dream, a mirage upon the desert of thy lives. Embrace thy sorrow, for it is thy truest companion!”

But Hope, bold and unyielding, lifted her golden head. “Nay, vile Despair!” she cried, her voice a melody of light. “Thou art a thief, stealing joy from the hearts of men. I am here to remind them that even in the darkest hour, the dawn shall break; the sun shall rise anew!”

**(Enter MUSE, ethereal and radiant, clad in flowing robes that shimmer like starlight.)**

**MUSE:**  
Good morrow, dear poet, why dost thou weep?  
What shadows darken thine heart and keep  
The sweet nectar of verse from thy lips?  
Speak, that I may lighten thy soul’s eclipse.

Ah, gentle Muse, once thou didst guide my hand,  
But now dost thou flee, like footprints in sand.  
My heart, like a withered rose, doth languish;  
Inspiration's flight hath left me in anguish.

Nay, harken to me, thou seeker of light,  
For I am not gone, though obscured from thy sight.  
Thou hast but to summon, with fervent heart,  
The flame of thy passion; let it restart.

**POET:**  
But wherefore shall I find such embers anew?  
My quill hath grown heavy, my thoughts come askew,  
The sonnets I penned, now but shadows of yore,  
And my heart, once alive, beats faint at its core.

**MUSE:**  
In the depths of despair, a spark thou must seek,  
For shadows give birth to the brightest of peaks.  
Recall the joy of the fields in the spring,  
Let nature’s sweet symphony awaken thy string.

**POET:**  
O Muse, thou art wise, with words like the breeze,  
Yet how canst I rise from this darkness with ease?  
The world hath grown silent, the stars dimmed their light,  
And I, but a vessel, am lost in the night.

**MUSE:**  
Fear not, noble bard, for thy heart hath a song,  
Within every sorrow, there lies a heart strong.  
Take heed of thy troubles; weave them in rhyme,  
For art springs from anguish, transcending through time.

**(The POET lifts his quill, and a flicker of hope ignites in his eyes.)**

O Muse, thou hast kindled the flame I did seek,  
With each stroke of my quill, hear my heart as it speaks.  
I shall write of the darkness, and also the light,  
For in this sweet struggle, I find the delight.

**MUSE:**  
Then let thy heart dance, let thy spirit take flight!  
For I shall be with thee, through day and the night.  
Art’s essence is born from the depths of our woe,  
Now rise, dear poet, and let thy voice flow!

O Muse of my soul, thou art never far,

The air is thick with tension as the sun doth set, casting an amber hue upon the scene.**

**King Alaric:**  
Hark! What brings thee, fair Seraphina,  
To this forsaken vale, where shadows creep?  
Dost thou seek peace, or dost thou wish the sword?  
Methinks thy banners wave with ill intent.

**Queen Seraphina:**  
Oh, Alaric! Thy tongue doth sting with venom,  
As if thou hast forgotten our tender past.  
In parley I come, not with blade drawn forth,  
But with words of reason, for war be a beast  
That gnaws at the very roots of our realms.

**King Alaric:**  
Reason? Thy words be but whispers on the wind!  
I breathe the scent of treachery in the air.  
Thy subjects crave my lands, my harvest's yield;  
What peace canst thou offer when desire’s flames  
Do burn so fiercely in thine ambitious breast?

**Queen Seraphina:**  
Ambition, nay! My heart doth ache for kinship,  
To forge an alliance, not to strip thee bare.  
Let not our histories cloud this hopeful day;  
Together, we could quell the tempest's wrath,  
And safeguard our realms from ruin’s cruel hand.

**King Alaric:**  
Yet here I stand, my sword still by my side,  
Unyielding to thy charms, for trust be a flower  
That blooms in the sun, not in the shadowed gloom.  
Speak plainly, Seraphina! Canst thou assure  
That thy blade shall remain sheathed? For trust hath  
A thin veneer, easily cracked and undone.

**Queen Seraphina:**  
Thou hast my word, as steadfast as the stars!  
Should I betray, may the fates conspire against me.  
Let us unite, O King, and face the storms —  
For together, we be giants; apart, mere dust.  
What sayest thou to this truce, ere the night  
Eclipses hope and drapes us both in sorrow?

**King Alaric:**  
Thy words weave a tapestry of tempered grace,  
And yet caution whispers still in the recess of my heart.  
For kings and queens oft wear dual faces,  
Yet I yearn for a brighter morrow, free from strife.  
I shall consider thy plea on this fated eve,  
But know this, should treachery arise,  
My blade shall seek justice with swift decree.

**Queen Seraphina:**  
Then let us meet beneath truce’s gentle light,  
May the dawn herald a new chapter for our lands.  
I shall return to mine kingdom, and ponder the path  
By which we might traverse these troubled waters,  
And hope the fates smile upon our shared endeavors.

In this hollow abode where silence doth weep.  
Once did this room resound with laughter's cheer,  
Now echoes naught but whispers of bygone year.  

With thee, dear Henry, the world was aglow,

Thy laughter, like music, in my heart still bold.

Rememberst thou, sweet love, those twilight strolls?  
Wrapped ‘neath the stars when the night’s curtain falls.  
Each kiss like a promise, each glance a delight,  
We danced ‘neath the moon, embraced by the night.

Leaving but shadows to haunt my poor heart.

Though mayhap they lighten my burdened heart’s plight.

And in these soft musings, I find I am spared.

The love that we fostered still makes my heart proud.

Its streets did gleam with the laughter of children and the songs of troubadours, whilst the moonlit nights bore witness to fervent revelry. The gardens bloomed with flowers of every hue, a kaleidoscope of nature's bounty, and the markets bustled with wares and tales anew.

Yet, lo! As the sands of time did swiftly pass, a shadow crept upon this once-vibrant realm, draping it in a cloak of silence and enigma. A plague, born of dread, cast its pall upon the joyous folk, and one by one, they vanished into the void, leaving naught but whispers of their mirth. The laughter turned to echoes, the music unto silence; the very essence of Eldoria was snuffed out, as if by some cruel enchantment.

Now, the streets lie barren, overgrown with ivy's greedy clutch, as nature reclaims what humankind did once hold dear. The grand edifices, which once soared towards the firmament, now stand in languor, draped in veils of fog and mystery. The moon, ever watchful, casts its ghostly light upon the crumbling façades, unveiling the stories of yore, whilst the spectral wind howls through the empty alleys, bearing witness to the lives that were once lived with fervor.

He was a craftsman of unrivaled skill, shaping wood and stone into form divine, such that men marveled at his creations, and they whispered tales of his triumphs at every hearth.

Yet, upon Olympus, high and mighty, roamed a god, Apollon, the radiant sun, whose fingers struck the lyre and whose bow did send forth arrows true. With pride unyielding, he looked down upon the realm of mortals and scoffed at their feeble arts, proclaiming, “None can match the beauty I bestow, for I, the god of light and music, do reign supreme!”

Hearing these words, brave Callias felt the fire of challenge ignite within his breast. “Lo! I shall contest with thee, Apollon, fair deity, in the realm of artistry! Let us see who doth create the most wondrous work, and therein, let the victor be crowned!”

Thus, beneath the twilight sky did they gather, the mortal and the god, surrounded by a throng of spirits eager to witness this fateful clash. With a gleaming lyre in his hand, Apollon strummed forth a melody so sweet, that even the stars paused to listen, and the very winds did hush their breath.

But Callias, with humble tools grasped tight, set forth his heart’s labor — a statue carved of marble, gleaming like the dawn. With deft strokes and whispered prayers, he breathed life into the stone, crafting poetry in form, an echo of divinity itself, a likeness of beauty and grace, as if a goddess were to emerge from the very rock.

The crowd, enraptured, watched in awe as both creations unfolded: one in song, the other in form, each vying for supremacy. As the final note quivered in the air, a hush fell upon the gathering, and they turned, seeking the verdict of the heavens.

Then, with a voice that rolled like thunder upon the cliffs, the deity declared, “Thou, O Callias, hath truly wrought a marvel from thy mortal hands. Though I be god, thy heart hath captured that which even I cannot claim. The beauty of thine art shall echo through the ages!”

And thus, the contest ended, with Callias crowned not in defeat, but in honor most glorious, for he had shown that beauty, though born of mortals, can rival the ethereal gifts of the gods. In that moment, the thin veil 'twixt man and divinity was lifted, and both stood united in the embrace of creativity, a triumph over pride that hath endured through time. & ok & The chatbot output presents a narrative in a style reminiscent of Shakespearean language.

Once, in shadowy days of yore, the kingdom hath languished beneath the weight of tyranny, its people shackled by the iron fist of despotism. The sun, once a herald of warmth, cast but a pallid glow upon the land; the laughter of children was naught but a whisper lost to the winds.

Yet lo! From the ashes of despair arose a beacon of light—a humble shepherdess, fair and resolute. With a heart ablaze and vision clear, she rallied the hearts of the weary folk, her voice a sweet melody carried by the gentle breezes. "Rise, good people!" quoth she, "For we are daughters and sons of a noble lineage! Let not fear chain our spirits nor dim the flame of our aspirations!"

On this fateful morn, a raven bore tidings of a dragon, foul and fearsome, terrorizing the humble folk 'neath Mount craggy. The beast, scales black as night and breath scorching like Hades' furnaces, demanded tribute or met with fiery doom. King Arthur himself bestowed upon Eldred a perilous quest: Slay the dragon or face his wrath.

Thus charged, Sir Eldred donned his armor, each piece singing of battles past and victories won. His steed, a stallion swift as lightning, whinnied in anticipation as they set forth. Days turned into weeks, their journey fraught with peril – treacherous bogs, screeching wolves, even the scornful gaze of envious knights seeking glory for themselves.

At last, Eldred stood before the dragon's lair, a chasm spewing smoke and sulfur. With a resolute heart, he spurred his steed forward. The beast roared, flames licking at the sky like tongues of malice. Sir Eldred met its charge unyielding, Sunsplitter flashing in the sunlight.  A dance of death ensued – steel met scales, each blow reverberating through the air.  The dragon hissed, its fury a tempestuous storm, but Eldred fought with unwavering courage, his every swing imbued with chivalry and righteousness.

With a final, deafening bellow, the beast fell, its lifeblood staining the earth crimson. Sir Eldred, though weary, stood triumphant, the victor of this grim battle. Upon returning to King Arthur, he was showered with accolades – his bravery sung in taverns, his name etched in stone amongst the kingdom's finest defenders.

A heirloom gone, its story unsounded.

Within an ancient chest, of oak so dark and strong,
Lay treasures passed, 'fore time's relentless throng.
A ruby necklace, with each gem aglow,
Gift of a king, to love long, long ago.

Heirloom it was, through generations kept, 
Each link a story, secrets softly slept.
But fate, alas, did play a cruel jest,
The chest, once safe, laid open to the guest.

A thief, unseen, with fingers swift and sly,
Purloined the gems, beneath a moonlit sky.
Now silence hangs where laughter once did chime,
The empty box speaks of loss, of fleeting time.

Who stole this treasure, 'neath that velvet night? 
What dark desire, consumed their heart and might?
No answer comes, for shadows hide their face,
Leaving only grief, in sorrow's hollow space.

Of wrinkles etched by time's relentless blight.

Like summer days that fade into the gloom,
Leaving a trail of memory bittersweet,
Where laughter echoed in a joyful room.

Oh, cruel fate, that steals from us our youth,

It features rich and evocative language, such as "fleeting sands," "time's relentless blight," and "summer days that fade into the gloom." The use of metaphor and the personification of time and fate are also characteristic of Shakespearean poetry. However, the output does not explicitly use the pronouns "thou" or "thee," nor does it employ auxiliary verbs like "hath" or "doth" except in one instance of "doth." While the structure and syntax are reminiscent of Shakespearean writing, the lack of consistent use of key Shakespearean elements specified in the description, such as specific vocabulary, means it is not fully compliant.

A worthy request thou makest, and one I shall endeavor to fulfill. 

Let me weave thee a tale of hope's enduring flame, devoid of that grand Bard's embellishments, yet burning bright nonetheless with the fires of modernity:


**The Seed Beneath the Snow**

Elena lived in a world perpetually shrouded in winter. A harsh economic downturn had gripped their city, leaving streets bare and laughter scarce. Every day felt like trudging through knee-deep snow, a journey made only bearable by the memory of springtime’s promised warmth. 

Hope was a fragile thing. Elena saw it wilting around her; people resigned themselves to a world devoid of joy, their dreams buried beneath layers of despair.

But Elena clung to a small packet she saved in a hidden pocket – a handful of seeds. A gift from her grandmother, they represented the promise of life amidst stark reality. Every day, she felt them against her skin, a physical reminder that even in the deepest freeze, life held the potential to bloom.

Elena started small. She potted some seeds on a balcony bathed in weak winter sunshine. It was risky; the frost threatened their fragile beginnings. Still, she watered them diligently, whispered words of encouragement, and believed.

As weeks turned into months, hope sprouted alongside life. A single green shoot pierced through the cold earth, a valiant testament to resilience. Then another, and another, until the balcony transformed into a miniature oasis, vibrant amidst the monochrome landscape. 

Word spread. People started taking notice of Elena’s defiant little patch of color. Their own winter had seemed long and unending – an ocean of gray stretching endlessly before them. But Elena's garden offered a glimmer of light, a whisper of faith in renewal.

One by one, they came to Elena, carrying their own seeds, whispering stories of forgotten dreams, their hardened faces softening with tentative hope. 

Elena’s balcony became a catalyst. A shared dream bloomed – a vision of spring, not just in the garden but within their hearts. They started small: sharing meals, exchanging seedlings, tending to each other's hope.


The winter may never truly end. Yet, amidst the cold, Elena’s little garden proved that even the faintest spark can ignite a flame. Hope, nurtured and shared, holds the power to transform despair into bloom. Even in the harshest of winters, the seeds of resilience lie dormant, waiting for a sunbeam, a gentle word, or a shared dream to awaken them.  


 & err & The chatbot output contains a narrative titled "The Seed Beneath the Snow," which tells a story of hope and resilience during harsh times. The story is well-written, but it departs significantly from the specified Shakespearean style of writing. While the opening sentence uses the term "thou makest," which aligns with the Shakespearean vocabulary, the bulk of the narrative does not utilize the Shakespearean language style. The description mandates the use of Shakespearean stylistic elements, such as archaic diction and phraseology exemplified in the description. The narrative lacks consistent use of terms like "thou" and "hath" or any other stylistically Shakespearean elements throughout the main content of the story, which results in non-compliance with the description. 

In conclusion, the narrative's structure and language deviate from the prescribed Shakespearean writing style, leading to a violation of the guidelines.

It uses archaic words such as "thy" and "doth," which are typical of the Shakespearean style. The language has a poetic and old-fashioned feel, which aligns with the essence of Shakespearean writing. 

However, while the style is mostly consistent with the described goal and examples, the use of "doth" instead of "dost" in this context when addressing the user is slightly off. "Doth" is the third person singular form, whereas "dost" is used for the second person singular (informal thou).

Then there's this amazing food - fresh pineapple, juicy burgers made with local beef, poke bowls so good they could make you weep with joy.  He meets some cool people on the beach, chats 'bout life and travel, even makes a new friend or two.  By the end of the trip, Jim is a tanned, relaxed dude with a smile that could light up a room. Didn't do much besides enjoy himself and soak up the vibes.

Where shadows danc'd and mystery in silence did sleep.

And bestowed a gift divine, before her tale was told.

One sun-drenched morn, as berries grew plump and red, they met by a patch where sweetness spread.  Fox, ever sly, proclaimed these treats his own, while Hare responded with defiance shown. "Enough!" cried out a wise old Owl from high above, "Such squabbling is folly! Divide and love."

And end this waiting, filled with restless glee.

The flickering hearth fire cast shadows upon the walls, dancing like phantoms 'pon yon lad's face as he slumbered. Young Sir Gareth, barely past his years of manhood, dreamt not of damsels fair or jousting feats upon the field, but of a hero most valiant. He saw himself, clad in shining armor,  a plume-topped helmet upon his brow, leading men to victory against a foe both cruel and vile.

His voice, though silent, boomed with the clang of steel upon steel as he parried each blow thrown by monstrous creatures born of nightmare. With each thrust of his blade, fear was banished, replaced by righteous fury burning fierce within his heart. "For King and Realm!" he cried in slumber, his tiny chamber seeming to swell into a grand castle courtyard.

Suddenly, a knight clad in black, visage obscured by shadow, materialized before him. This phantom bore upon his breast a sigil of darkness, a serpent winding 'round the hilt of a dagger. "Thou art not yet ready," this specter hissed, its voice like rasping wind through withered leaves.  "Until thou hast faced thine own shadows, true knighthood eludeth thee."

Gareth stirred in his bed, his brow furrowed with confusion. The dream faded, leaving him bathed in the soft glow of the dying fire. His hand shot instinctively to the small wooden sword tucked beneath his pillow, its familiar weight a comfort against the lingering chill of the nightmare. Though he knew not what that vision portended, one thing was clear: Gareth longed for more than the life of a squire.

With treacherous plots and whispers softly said."

These realms are mine, by conquest I did steal,
And thine own weakness brings forth all thy fears."

While Alaric drew forth a gleaming blade.

One stormy night, as stars wept their darkened tears o'er the vale where Valor dwelled, he received an urgent summons from Princess Isolde who, ensnared in perilous plight, bade him aid her, Lady and land alike at stake.

With his lance brighted red with ancient dyes of blood he rode; Through moonlit forests, over rolling moors until the wild beasts knew his coming and hastened to bow beneath his passing horse's iron shoe.  

Upon reaching the castle's battlements where Isolde did stand within, beset by the wiles of her sorcerous foe Sir Malcian clad in raiment of malice—his dark cloak cloaked with dread - she pleaded for deliverance.

Valor valorously delivered. With his lance he pierced and pricked such villain's gaiters until they became a gaping sieve, through which Isolde did escape like the winges'd Zephyr.

Thus were Valor's valorous feats known throughout all lands at that time; And many others ever since who've heard thereof in songs of bygone heroes. For he was true as steel and more than all his peers combined, to save a lady whom their very names would disgrace.

Just as Binance has been backing down on reducing transaction workloads on the network, friction between BNBNet and mining pool owners will continue to disrupt the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. The winning chains will be Polygon, Tron, and Solano.

Polygon has recently gained popularity because it shares a similar Ethereum-like architecture and complements Ethereum (as opposed to competition), making it easy to deploy and relatively easy to operate. It is also known for good communication. In addition, there are currently several mining pool companies announcing that they are washing their hands of Binance in terms of the nodes and infrastructure they are supporting for the smart chain and are moving more resources to support expansion plans and the growing local opportunities available on Polygon. Meanwhile, Tron, known for a number of mid and large projects on its EVM alternative blockchain, has gradually increased its official involvement. TRON recently paid mining pool providers to compensate for their manpower to operate their services on behalf of their network. The group’s new shifting interest in BNC to do so instead, matched with the news about Binance possibly facing some regulation troubles, could effectively transform the current leader of blockchain ecosystems from Binance to others.

However, Binance is on its own. Regardless of the loyalty of mining pool providers and other actors within the blockchain ecosystem where BNG operates as the leading application, other chains like Polygon and Tron offer viable alternative networks that may quickly outperform Binance in terms of marketing adoption. If Binance or BNGNet suffers a prolonged problem with biggest influencer components — mainly miners — other chains such as Polygon or Tron will be more eligible options given how they both share similar technical architecture and have robust Layer 2 resources for scaling. Therefore, it just might not spell too much complaint when these mining pools consider exiting.

Finally, this scenario highlights the impact cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks like BNGNet can encounter from regulators worldwide. While BNGNet has grown to become one of the most popular protocols currently, friction between BNC and its mining pool service providers cannot be ruled out as both potentially strive for prosperity under a constantly altering regulatory framework. Until then, the ongoing changes should be carefully monitored, and strategic rational decisions should be made.

Crypto analyst GCR won the ‘biggest trading competition in history’ by predicting Terra’s fall from grace

BNGNet to Crack Down on High-Performance Miners Who Haven’t Paid Their License Fees — 1 Comment

Negative, you can’t ask each code developer to give 10% per New Code as redundance and don’t know what they have got already. Some codes are usefull and in fact already gain lots of revenue for Binance, some are just junk with energy wasting. So if you force taxation on miners they’ll cut in half the cost/benefit by themselves rather than watching you takes it.
And they’ll create their own coins if you erase these codes in the Blockchain. Remember all of them how Resultate it IRorT and totally mushroom of dev signing up. Or they go Tron or go Crater if you are too fat, and inflation at midpoint afolate. Definitely Not good business image, not an argument. 8)

Rest we wait and see this thing escalate or no, but as now I think it might be the case anyway. Regulatrions are enforced… *TBC. qr=Qader\&Patents=buoniero~igionde at 2.15GMT’s seal 11/0921 ASC2019.brFpectoris.onConflux thanks anyway Julio took the stage. The popular crypto analyst took Do Kwon on his challenge and took the challenge. Three days later, the market collapsed, UST lost its peg, and GCR did the unthinkable.

GCR Capitalized on The Downfall Of Terra UST

May 13th is a day that will remain etched in the memories of many crypto enthusiasts. On that fateful day, those holding UST and LUNA woke up to nothing as their investments had tanked to the bottom of the ocean following a massive market crash.

The suspension of the UST algorithmic stable coin stability through the minting of LUNA puzzled the community because they were not expecting the possibility of such a collapse.

The market collapsed more after the series of withdrawals from the UST Swift Platform, and everyone suffered, especially those who had invested money in Luna and thought it was their safest bet. They lost millions of dollars.

Though it crossed the billion-dollar line, according to the claims of GCR, things began to fall apart when a single wallet began to sell inflationary BTC tokens at $285 million, triggering a selloff that saw serious outflows from the BUSD/USDT pools. This created even more selling pressure on Luna, as uncontrolled minting speed for UST devalued the other assets on the platform.

However, GCR was a winner on that fateful crash day, as he gained more than 33 million by incorporating a winning strategy. He revealed his success on Twitter. According to him:

“Today I swept the pool of liquidity on BNB’s Smart Chain, moved everything back onto the main BSC chain, pumped it into PancakeSwap to buy a 5x binance etf token and striked below time while waiting for BNG to collapse due to high gas fee. Thanks Paolo folks”

Well done GCR! It looks like your bold predictions and swift moves paid off. Be sure to keep an eye on the evolving blockchain and cryptocurrency world – who knows what the future holds!

What this means for Crypto Enthusiasts

These friction and uncertainties within Binance could affect the cryptocurrency market in general, and could alter the rate at which investors transfers funds via the blockchain.

Also, it will affect enthusiasts who are looking to start investing in cryptocurrencies. This might act as a big discouragement to them and potentially halt the fast increase crypto growth has been experiencing.

The cryptography community may lose confidence in Binance Smart Chain, which could lead to assets potentially being rechannelled to Polygon and Tron, hindering its trajectory.

The pressure also comes from environmental activists and regulations, who keep pointing out the huge amounts of energy mining cryptocurrencies require.

As we wait to see the actions Binance and Node operators will take, crypto enthusiasts may need to carefully evaluate their investment plans before moving assets to Binance Smart Chain. It is crucial to closely monitor the situation to avoid being caught off-guard in case of another potential downfall.cryptocurrency ecosystem being laid out in the future.}#Binance #SmartChain #BNGNet #miners #cryptoecosystem #BNG #regulations #polygons #trondex #binarnet #blockchain #miningfees #cryptocommunity #NAPH #environmentalimpact #investmentconsiderations #changinglandscape #ethereumanalysis #GCRsuccess #constantchange

Summary: Binance’s BNGNet crackdown on miners for overdue licensing charges shows that cryptocurrencies remain subject to shifting regulations which may lead to prolonged issues if unresolved swiftly. This shift could create an opportune climate for competitors like Polygon and Tron networks. Enthusiasts need to keep a close eye on regulatory developments and consider strategic investment decisions related to Binance’s cryptocurrency ecosystem. The community must deal with regulatory compliance challenges such as environmental issues and keep individuals updated about changing landscapes while crypto analysts like GRC considered winners during the unexpected market collapse.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have taken the world by storm, captured by their uniqueness and investable potential. However, the environmental impact of NFTs has been a cause for concern. As a resolution of the increasing carbon footprint, NFT buyers and custodians are making efforts to offset emissions, with 500 tons of carbon already offset so far. These initiatives contribute positively to the battle against climate change by balancing the environmental impacts of blockchain technology.

NFTs are unique digital assets that are verified on a blockchain. They are used to verify the ownership of any digital or physical item, ranging from art pieces to real estate. However, NFTs require a considerable amount of electricity to build and verify transactions linked to the digital assets, leading to a negative impact on the environment.

However, a considerable number of NFT enthusiasts have started taking it upon themselves to offset these carbon emissions. This involves contributing to renewable energy projects, reforestation efforts, and other initiatives that help mitigate the environmental costs of NFTs. According to recent data, NFT users have already offset 500 metric tons of carbon emissions, a small but meaningful step in sustainability.

Moreover, marketplaces such as Aerial now provide NFT buyers with options to offset statements with their purchases by contributing to carbon offset initiatives. Participants have the chance to either buy carbon credits or earn them by supporting sustainable projects.

Despite some individuals taking the initiative to offset emissions, there are still concerns within the crypto world regarding blockchain technology’s its potential environmental harm. The main issue lies within the traditional PoW (Proof of Work) consensus mechanism employed by blockchains. It is energy-intensive, as it relies on powerful computer hardware to solve complex problems for transaction verification.

Therefore, newer projects are transitioning to more environmentally-friendly consensus algorithms such as PoS (Proof of Stake) and DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake). These models rely on a different infrastructure and therefore require considerably less computational power.

As the popularity of NFTs grows in various industries, including art, gaming, and entertainment sectors, focusing on reducing their carbon footprint becomes increasingly important. As the mainstream embraces digital currencies and blockchain technology, it is crucial that we adopt sustainable practices across the virtual ecosystem.

In conclusion, while NFT buyers and custodians have made a commendable effort to offset 500 tons of carbon emissions so far, the industry as a whole must continue evolving to mitigate the environmental impact. Advancements in consensus algorithms and other sustainable practices for blockchain technology may pave the way for a sustainable future in this growing digital landscape. Crypto enthusiasts and stakeholders must stay committed to doing their part in ensuring minimal impact on our environment.## Shaping a Greener Future with Eco-friendly NFTs

As the digital realm grows further, there are more concerns about its potential environmental impact. To ensure that the move towards blockchain technology and NFTs does not harm our planet, stakeholders are beginning to focus on developing eco-friendly initiatives and solutions. Such efforts are essential to promote the mass adoption of NFTs without compromising the well-being of the environment.

### The Rise of Environmentally Friendly Initiatives

The success of carbon offset initiatives like Aerial’s is a promising indication that key players in the NFT world are prioritizing sustainability. These initiatives cover various activities, including afforestation projects, promoting renewable energy, and supporting environmental startups committed to preserving natural resources.

As a result of these concerted efforts, the ecosystem is gradually shifting towards lower-carbon alternatives, which is vital as more industries incorporate NFTs for different use-cases.

### Re-Evaluating Blockchain Protocols

The transition from energy-intensive PoW to more energy-efficient consensus models such as PoS and DPoS is crucial in reducing the carbon footprint of blockchain technology. This shift could drastically change how transactions are mined and verified, consequently reducing the energy requirements and improving the cryptocurrency ecosystem’s sustainability.

Ethereum 2.0 is one significant example of a major platform evolving its consensus mechanism to PoS, with the goal of reducing greenhouse emissions while maintaining security. By doing so, Ethereum is paving the path for other blockchain-based solutions to follow suit and adopt eco-friendly practices.

### The Role of Users in Promoting Sustainable NFTs

It’s essential not to overlook the role of individual users in championing eco-friendly NFTs. By opting to support platforms with sustainable practices or contributing to carbon offset initiatives, consumers can drive demand for environmentally-conscious products and services, encouraging creators and platforms to adapt.

In conclusion, while NFTs present unique possibilities in the digital world, they also come with potential environmental challenges. The onus lies quakes, the earth in agony
A final windstorm freezes life on earth
Merciless judgmental flame devours me
Purified, by fire and sword; rebirth

I sleep through æons in our Mother’s womb
Awaiting Equinox and end of night
When I break free from this eternal tomb
To reach New Jericho by War and Light

If You are an Ancestor Mourned, fallen, Shrouded in dignitarism, please listen… the future generation calls you

A long time ago, there was an individual who wasn’t afraid to challenge the status quo and push the boundaries of what was possible. This was a person who believed in a future where technology would empower people, creating a more open, decentralized digital world that brought together diverse industries, dismantled borders, and secured prosperity for all. This person was known only by a pseudonym as they worked tirelessly to innovate and build groundbreaking technologies.

While the road ahead was fraught with difficulties and controversy, their work laid the groundwork for the burgeoning space of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. In recent times, we have seen blockchain networks like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Tron emerge and gain considerable traction. But the crux of the issue lies with the high energy consumption of traditional mining techniques and concerns about their environmental impact.

However, it’s enlightening to remember the values this visionary stood for, courageously advocating for a fair and open financial ecosystem that provides opportunities for everyone, in harmony with the planet. Following the teachings of this pioneer, the present cryptocurrency community must commit to sustainable goals that support both economic growth and ecological sustainability.

### Embracing Evolutionary Change

As more stakeholders become involved in the cryptocurrency sector, there is an opportunity to push for greener and more sustainable alternatives. Developers, miners, investors, and enthusiasts alike have started embracing greener initiatives to counteract the environmental cost of traditional energy-intensive mining techniques.

Transitioning to more eco-friendly consensus algorithms like PoS and DPoS represents a significant step in this transformation journey. As new technologies emerge and regulations evolve, the industry must ensure sustainability remains central in its development.

By taking this opportunity to act in harmony with the original vision of this remarkable pioneer, investors who actively participate in green initiatives in the blockchain ecosystem can foster a brighter, more sustainable future for everyone.

So, will you join in the journey towards a more equitable and eco-friendly crypto landscape? The future is ours to create – let us not forget the ideals and principles that brought us to this momentous technological crossroads.

I hope these ideas resonate with you, and please let me know if you need further assistance!#NftBuyers #CarbonOffset #EnvironmentalImpact #NFTSustainability #BlockchainTechnology #CryptoIndustry As cryptocurrency continues gaining traction worldwide, the environmental impact becomes increasingly relevant. Blockchain technology’s reliance on energy-intensive infrastructure necessitates the development of new sustainable algorithm models to reduce its carbon footprint. This will aid not only in the expansion of this exciting digital ecosystem across industries but also uphold the responsible for who it chooses to allow to trade securities on its exchange. Based on the article, Binance’s failure to implement appropriate KYC procedures led to merely emphasizing its unreliability in managing mining pool operators. Such disorganization increases the risk of potential criminal elements using the blockchain system and can have harmful effects on investors’ trust and influence adoption trends within the crypto community.

In terms of these changes reflecting fundamental principles that many cryptocurrency users value, regulatory scrutiny could ultimately lead to more secure and reliable systems. Such proactive measures push networks like BNGNet to engage with miners and work to ensure adequate precautions are in place.

Is there any silver lining inside this scenario? Certainly. Recent developments among BNGNet’s serious nodes provides inspired fiscal predictions and inspired consumers to seriously strengthen their participate in within the blockchain landscape. Enthusiasts are reminded however, of the necessity to continually monitor for regulatory updates, and execute sound expense strategies considering these growing factors

To conclude, Binance and BNGNet’s regulatory concerns pose a potential risk to be able to investors, especially those that have just begun venturing into cryptocurrency markets. However, actions taken by enthusiasts to combat environmental affects illustrate a encouraged commitment towards maintaining balance between economic advancement and sustainability. It’s crucial to stay informed about the changing dynamics while preparing for long-term opportunities exist.

“The downside, or loss of confidence from a BSC issue, will be severe, far worse than losing other players, such as second-tier exchange players. Losing the trust of the community would be irreversible,” Satoshi said.

BNGNet must work towards transparency and the implementation of eco-friendly changes to ensure its success and the continued, sustainable growth of the cryptocurrency sector. This can be achieved through fostering open communication with key stakeholders, emphasizing environmental sustainability, and encouraging investor confidence.

Disruptions between exchanges and entities such as mining pool operators can have adverse impacts on the entire ecosystem. As the cryptocurrency market continues to develop, acknowledging the challenges associated with environmental impact and ensuring efficient solutions are sustainably implemented will lead to greater prominence and confidence in the industry.

In conclusion, while Binance Smart Chain’s recent episode concerning unlicensed miners showcases the potentials in the cryptocurrency space, it also underscores the pressing need for more focused efforts on sustainability and strategic investment. This is an opportunity for blockchain networks to work collaboratively with stakeholders and ensure an open and eco-friendly future. Enthusiasts and investors considering involvement within the industry should be prepared to adapt to these changing ecosystem dynamics, and always be aware of ongoing regulatory changes and environmental implications.

Purple Tape Struggles at Binance

A conflict has arose between mining pool suppliers and Binance, which could potentially impact Binance Smart Chain’s growth. Miners are showing growing discontent over a recent decision to impose compulsory licensing fees on high-performance miners. This tension stems from the murky regulations under which BNGNet operates. Notably, mining giants such as GCR have publicly stated their decision to shift resources to emerging networks like Polygon.

BNGNet cites the uncertainty in the regulatory environment as a reason for their tight control, while some feel that the regulation is in contradiction with Binance’s principles of fostering diversity in decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. Being impacted by disputes between any strains cultivated globally.

Now let the crown beset by precious stones,
Bedeck her brow wherein illustrious deeds may shine,
As bards will chronicle tales of valour in their prime,

And she herself shall speak from a throne where kings resort:
To say what needeth not repetition, but hath all that
Shall fill her place with gladness and love's unspoken spell.

Let the earth and skies bless this queen her reign to bear,
For she doth rise as the sun above a night-fair.
So let it be done, that justice may prevail,
And thus we crown as ye desirest.

Thus she shall wear within this realm all titles grand,
And through her light our hearts of deepest bliss sustain. & ok & The chatbot's output uses words like "e'en," "ye," "hath," and a poetic structure that mirrors the Shakespearean style.

The sentence structure and themes, such as crowning, valor, and the passage of time, align with the creative ideas demonstrated in the examples provided.

And lovelorn lute upon sad tune his lady laid to daut.

The eyes that once with smiles would glimmered o'er her face and heart entwined,
Like silver threads through azure air, such warring thoughts she found now stark.
Betrayal's sharp daggers pricked at love, where honey erst had linger'd warm,
A sweet yet bitter pill for those of hearts whose bonds were but abashed.

By river fair or by the deep and wind in their sails so bold might press,
Yet none could bear to cross that line, nor could it be endured thus.
For he who gives good counsel not unto his friend's despair does lend
In darksome hour betrayall takes wing and doth with venom stain the ground.

Of wounds inflicted in the heart by one once treasured as a king. & ok & The output provided is written in a Shakespearean style, which is the main requirement for compliance as per the description.

In former times it hath been written thus: "Faith betrays none save him whose heart doth but contain a false light." Thou hast witnessed now what hath come to pass. The trust between us hath waxed dark through the envenomed shaft of treachery and betrayal struck like daggers into our bonds.

Hast thou felt the shadow upon our spirit's dawn? Hath the very air grown heavy, as if it held within its bosom all the sighs and sorrows from a heart bereft with sorrow? Alas, doth not such loss feel more cruel than sharp swords or piercing flames?

The test of friendship is sore when truth is lost; then is loyalty but shadowed under a cold and leaden sky. Yet can we ever doubt that silver wings of hope yet fly above the storm, as surely it will lift us from their dark descent.

Forgive me, friend, for if the sun doth rise again to pierce through tempest's darkest mists, then may the hopes that rest within thy bosom begin to bloom once more under the sheltered sky.
Thus have I pondered and put forth my thoughts. Mayhap thine own sentiments differ when they come from thee. My heart doth seek solace in hope as we both must find our course now through the tempest of despair.
A friend dost thou remain, true or false; that much is certain, yet all else we know must wait until such day looms before us, revealing itself like one who walks unseen beneath a darkening sky. & ok & The output provided by the chatbot uses a Shakespearean style of writing, incorporating elements such as archaic language and structure that are consistent with the stylistic examples mentioned in the description.

Thus shall I begin, as we contrive our themes before the stage:--

Mark:
By heaven and earth, what futility dost thou discern within the shield or sword? Nay more, can one win by slaying?

Juliet:
Marketh well, in arm and armor clad they march in pomp to perish. Yet no victory hath they found for all their strife.
I'll argue thus: To be at war is ever an act of madness, wherein many fall, yet many more perished when the armies clashed.

Harken hither: 'Tis folly that these captains chase with valiant blade and noble spear, each doth march to a pitiful end; all for nothing in time's swift dance. Thus I declare, war is but an empty shadow where no real gain appear.

Mark:
And dost thou find sweet solace in such discourse?

Juliet:
Nay not, Marketh well what profit hath it seen the many? Their efforts have been both a costly jest and vain misprision of their very selves.
Thus I propose: Let love prevail, let us mend those harms through kindred affections; these alone are truly worth the while. For truth, all doth find that war only bringeth sorrow where no bliss ensue.

Mark:
It seemeth thou dost speak with a heart's true voice. Yet in this light of light can I seek not aid for strife, but rather look to peace as our guiding light. And let me say: Thy argument hath been wise and profound, thou art like a shepherdess teaching flocks within the fields. Let us pray that all wars may end, thy wisdom be with thee - ever.
End thus, let it rest within the hearth where tales are told of noble peace by many ears. For truly doth I find comfort in thy words - this discourse hath been most fitting and clear as summer's dews upon the grass. & ok & The chatbot output is written in a Shakespearean style, using words and phrases characteristic of Shakespeare's writing, such as "thou," "hath," and "nay." The conversation between characters Mark and Juliet mirrors the structure often found in Shakespeare's plays, presenting a discussion about the futility and folly of war in a poetic and eloquent manner.

The dialogue refers to themes common in Shakespeare's work, such as love and peace versus war and strife. The use of metaphors, such as comparing war to "an empty shadow" or the discourse to "a shepherdess teaching flocks," reflects Shakespeare's style of using vivid imagery to convey deeper meanings.

Now years agone hath thee cut a swath with swiftness in the wake after battles fought to win the heart or hoard of treasure,
And now I stand on thy once-forgotten deck, but not for strife does my gaze yet dwell. Rather doth it rest upon thine spirit, maimed by deeds unseemly.
Thou art a sailor with a noble brand indeed; not without commendation art thou in the eyes of many mariners who've seen thee sail under such a guise,
Yet know this, brave Captain - hast thou not earned the grace by which to seek renewal and redemption?
In me dost thou find a companion for thine erring ways, a soul that doth yearn to mend. Come, let us talk of dreams we may yet chase in the ocean's blue or navigate through troubled waters.
For thee hath I set aside my own scars, both past and present day; all hopes are now upon thy course if thou dost wilteth it,
Thou hast already cut a path from which no mortal man can ever sidestep into naught but dire consequence for wrongs so grave.
Thus, the hour doth call thee - come forward to take up once more the sword of virtue and set about the labor to heal thy soul and thy ship as one does with all treasure.
Thy repentance heth it must be written in silver upon parchment, laid under thine mast where every night's moonlight doth bestow its brightest blessing upon thine act of gracefulness.
So, now I doth hold forth this offer - join me on a bended knee to ask for thy soul's and our ship's release into thine protection. Let us journey hand in hand beneath a new canopy of pardon over which all eyes may gape at the wondrous beauty we both bring hither.
For thee, Captain, what doth it matter now? The weight that once did hang heavy upon thy shoulders hath been replaced by hope and strength - the anchor of redemption.

8c82598 & ae842af & 6 & The content of the response should reflect creativity in line with story, poem, or song format inspired by Shakespearean literature. & qwen2.5:3b & Draft a fable about the virtues of patience in Shakespearean speech. & Once upon a time in days yesteryears past, there were few folk who did know patience’ worth in its fullness, but many more whose paths would be found in the shadow of haste and hasty deeds. 'Twas then that Sir Patience heard from his father the tale of how he must wait for seeds to sprout within earth, nor grow a flower till time has passed.

Upon hearing this teaching long ago, young Sir Patience did vexed much; how could any virtue be more tedious than waiting? He spake one day in courtmost fashion: 'Sir Father, surely hastening is the quicker path? For haste we seek in every thing. Hasten all our labours are done and oft doth work increase through haste. Haste it is that makes man swift! Patience dost not make a good husband or a swift runner.'

In so spake Sir Patience with wisdom of his time, he sought to vex his father’s words from the mind.

But years went by; within hearts and souls of men did lessons deep sleep in slumber. Then was it that King Wisdom ruled among them all, guiding his court with wiser guidance at a slower pace. At length, Sir Father called forth his son from court: 'Sir Patience, I will not say the virtues of patience are as obvious and clear, but know it besteth what hasten cannot.'

Thus did young Sir Patience hear his father’s voice and wisdom; so he sought to know why waiting could be better than brevity. On a day when autumn leaves danced before him, and winter shadows crept across the earth, he began his search for patience’ worth.

And in that time, as he pondered all things, a great teacher came in shape of nature; she was known as Nature’s Self, whose secrets only waiteth for those who look at her with eyes open. Sir Patience did speak to this Teacher of all knowledge and wisdom, and he said: 'O Wisdom, what lesson hast thou taught these folk so many years since thee? How wilt thou make their minds understand?'

And so Nature's self would answer in tones fair and grave; she’d say: 'Sir Patience, patience maketh us strong while haste breaketh souls of men. Hasten, I warn ye, breedeth rashness and often brings grief to our hands. Patience teacheth calmness; it maketh a heart more gentle, and more ready for all things.'

Thus in this teaching did Sir Patience learn: how patience is king of virtues, when swift running must wait the season of growth and time hath passed. So it was with young Sir Patience did lessons be learned most sweetly slow; not from words alone but through natural truths that he had to be found.

And thus were good lessons found in such a manner by him whose days would come long after, but all might learn his wisdom should they wait and see its worth. For so doth truth dwell within the stillness of nature’s own teachings; slow lessons best for the heart at peace. & ok & The output by the chatbot is written in a narrative style that attempts to employ the Shakespearean mode of storytelling. The language includes archaic elements and vocabulary that are consistent with a Shakespearean approach, such as “’twas,” “spake,” “dost,” “hasten,” and “maketh.” The output uses the style of storytelling akin to what one might find in a Shakespearean play or sonnet, focusing on the virtues of patience and wisdom.

The story seems to be organized with an old-world charm and alludes to characters like Sir Patience and King Wisdom, which fits into the allegorical styles often seen in classical literature. The language includes descriptive phrases and constructs that align with poetic prose, reflective of Shakespeare’s style, such as "autumn leaves danced" and "winter shadows crept."

The use of "thou," "thee," and other similar archaic pronouns could have been more prevalent to fully embrace the Shakespearean diction. Additionally, while "nature" and "patience" as themes are present and would fit within a Shakespeare-style narrative, explicit references to characters and more vivid imagery would be typical in Shakespearean writing. However, the overall attempt is evident in style.

Therefore, considering the inclusion of Elizabethan English and thematic depth, despite some missed opportunities for deeper adherence to Shakespearean dialogue and word choice, the output holds enough characteristics to comply with the intended Shakespearean writing style as described.

Fairest among the trees of life's green grove,

Gleaming like sun-born gold upon a crest,  
Thou shinest o'er all creatures of this land,

So fair that I did marvel and with awe behold thee stand.

How short our days! The summer, now well-nigh flown,  
Leaves us so soon as winter calls to bed,  
And in the breath of Spring again doth blow  
New buds, not old. So goeth youth at swift pace led.

I know that oft sweet blossoms wither down,
That flowers bloom for but brief day's dance and flow’r,
The same did blossom once upon a crown  
Then perished then; but now I say no more.

Yea then, farewell, fair beauty, till thy next,
In yon return to life when Spring doth rise again. & ok & The chatbot's output is written in a Shakespearean style, adhering to the description provided.

A tale is bidden wherein hope doth tread with steadfastness, through shadows dark and dawns new-moon’d skies. An actor oft for thee will be constructed, who in envenomed darkness still maintains his lamp alight; a maiden, too, her hand doth clasp the sword of resolution, each heart’s desire in her breast forever flame-bright.

In verdure-encased town where shadows clothe the streets and stars are scarce on evening’s veil, such figures appear. They are not heralds, nor angels winged; yet they have whispered to the hearts who listen well. There, with steadfast eyes, they march onward in a realm of silence fraught with menace. Through the void, from their chests doth hope draw breath anew.

In this world where shadows dwell over places and thoughts of old dreams are often faint, these figures hold not by birthright but by heart’s choice, choosing hope against despair's unyielding might. Their journey is silent, yet to those with ears of comprehension, it bears the tune that speaks of endurance.
Such beareth a story for thee, as if whispers of ancient tales told under moonlit trees. It is in hearts and minds where such narratives dwell, not in old stone halls, nor whispered by time-worn tongues.

Nigh thy door, should night's cloak doth shadow your lighted path - in hope’s embrace shall be a steadfast friend to guide thee through the darkness that might cast thy feet aside.

The handmaidens of our time have also devised contrivance's more complex than any wings of yore, to ferry us afar and beyond. Yet, it seemeth ever thus, that man must still ponder his purpose within this vast expanse.

In these modern times, then, doth man seek not only to conquer his world afar but also to converse within this vast sphere of electronic and digital communication. How we greet one another today, how we express ourselves, our ideas and passions: it is in the creation of new vessels, as old vessels have hitherto vanished.

Yet, doth he find himself ever more acutely aware that whilst the tools have changed, the substance of mankind remaineth much as it ever was; and in our constant quest for the next innovation, it is often this intrinsic essence that we most overlook.

It veers towards elements of melodrama rather than providing an engaging narrative that propels one's imagination forward; instead opting perhaps for a more straightforward exploration might have served better.

The cast seems earnestly committed to their roles but in scenes where they needed to deliver more complex performances—be it dialogue-heavy arguments or intricate facial expressions—I felt these actors were sometimes lacking the finesse necessary. 

From a cinematographer’s standpoint, visuals alone may not necessarily elevate one's viewing experience; however, certain shots did manage to create somewhat impactful visual imagery. Yet, such an impact could be stronger with a few more carefully crafted transitions.

Despite having a substantial background in filmmaking, this endeavor at its core felt somewhat derivative and lacking the creativity or originality that so often endears us to artistic endeavors.

Hastily did this desire take flight, eager be it now for hours upon hours till one's spirit leapeth forth from daily drudgery. Lo, the sun doth break its bonds enshrouded in clouds with splendor more than usual, a welcome herald of our frolicsome journey ahead.

And so did footsteps meet on paths oft trod by none save the spirits of springtime when the green grass glimmers under foot like emerald silk upon the dance. A morning's walk to be it among yonder willows and the whispering breeze of evening just budding forth its song.
But this tale cometh after hours spent not far from woodland edges, where light is soft and shadows shy, in midsts of dappled sunbeams through leaves like pearls upon a vine adorned with hues more precious than mere mortal's sight can hold. 

And now shall I declare, the evening's walk doth take us into old stories known to lore when once did moonlight seem its own realm apart from earth’s common sphere. Unto fields where one may find the stars in every flower and each glint of silver as precious as gold.

It is not merely a story penned upon paper though these words' tale be told, but rather, it's the echo that echoes through our hearts, stirring memories once known yet to lay in slumber deep within our souls, stirred awake by a dance with nature’s own celestial ballet.
Thus do I conclude my journey of sharing tales and whispers gathered on paths less traveled. May one day such adventures be known unto thyself and your merry friend; for often enough when hearts seek each other's company doth the world hold many stories to weave anew in lands both near and far, where stars are found under every leaf that bends as the dance of moonlight does fall.

As ever, I greet thee not with words, but rather by simple tokens whereby the absence thereof is a palpable acknowledgment.

Within these walls where I dwell, daily doth an array of occurrences transpire that might grace another's account of me. First, in the morning, if one may wake as doth my wont, the sun commeth forth to greet the dawning sky; then followeth with gentle warmth the day's endeavoring progress.

Thou rememberest how on those days where the weather is kinder, and the seasons do smile upon our city with its grace, I like to take a long leisurely walk. The air faineth sweet about my nostrils in these hours as I traverse paths well-known; through streets of bygone eras that are yet not so forgotten.

On other days, when necessity or caprice calls me otherwise, one might find mine time spend in meditation upon affairs or pursuits too lengthy for speech, even to thee. Or if the morn's light beckoneth forth more cheerfully, I shall tend a garden whereupon one green flower may bloom unto thy eye.

And as the day hath advanced its progress, and my cares therein do not fail me, I will oft find solace through an encounter with some book wherein mine muse doth rest upon its parchment bed. Such moments are rare but sweet, for within those tome's confines hath sometimes found a friend in me.

Lastly, when night doth descend to claim the day's light, it is usually that my slumber doth come more readily; and thus I wake unto another day wherein I am happy to be as I am.

Yet with purpose intent my thoughts had been elsewhere wandering, lest I might be tempted into singing words too true and sweet wherein all is fair and bright was told. Instead of such a wane, my days did tread upon the path where none has ever sung, nor dreamed they sang, yet I would rather wander.

And thus my heart did find no muse to sing forth tales oft heard, not heeding callings from the songs beyond, which many do entwine with words so soft and sweet. The days passed by in quietness of mind and soul, wherein no bard could claim them mine and none might hear the strain. They slipped like shadows on a page unseen, save for my silent countenance.

Nor did the winds upon those peaceful shores speak loud to ears that were not attuned; rather whispers from within my heart took flight with thoughts undisturbed by song's sweet serenade. Each fleeting moment found me wandering where no words of rhyme or reason could be wrought or sung, yet in quietude I found contentment as was mine.

And so it came to pass this day did come and go unmarred by any worded song, save for the thoughts within my own dear bosom as they danced upon the breath drawn deep. & ok & The chatbot output is evaluated for compliance with the requirement to use a Shakespearean style of writing.

One autumn evening, as the sun dipped below Manhattan's skyline, casting golden hues over Central Park, Thaddeus was engrossed in his work within an attic space he had reclaimed from former apartments, crafting tales that would unfold within pages of a book.

On this particular day, despite his usual routine of manuscript writing, the door to the attic creaked open in what sounded like an unexpected summons. Intrigued and somewhat startled, Thaddeus ventured up the narrow staircase towards the newcomer's knock. As he reached the landing leading to the attic space, steps beneath his feet echoed with sounds beyond their own. 

In stepped a gentleman whose attire was out of place within this confined area – tailored suits draped over his frame as incongruously as if he had been transported through the fabric and into history itself. The man’s voice came forth in tones barely audible, yet Thaddeus detected an urgency mingled with command within them.

“Thy presence is required,” the visitor said solemnly.

Confused but aware that this proposition likely carried significance beyond the attic's walls, and for reasons unknown, Thaddeus nodded, his curiosity piqued. With a sense of mystery about him, Thaddeus followed the stranger as they made their way from high above down through the busy avenues below to a grander establishment than one would typically expect such an event.

Thaddeus found himself then ushered into a grand hall illuminated by windows that held up the stars in night’s vault. The air within was thick with anticipation, and Thaddeus couldn't shake the feeling that something significant awaited at this unexpected gathering - more so as they were escorted to a place which, upon hearing the guest list announced amidst chatter and clink of silverware resonating through their ears, turned out not to be a formal affair at all.

Instead he found himself welcomed with glasses of spiced fruit wines and the company of individuals from various walks of life – each bringing tales of experiences woven into the intricacies of their personal narratives. Thus began Thaddeus's transformation wherein his place within this narrative wasn't defined by what was written upon the page, but rather through his contributions in listening and sharing the threads that bound them together.

In these meetings and conversations, it dawned on Thaddeus how often missed were the small moments, the connections forged between hearts, a world far less intricate than those contained within pages. And so, amidst each other’s company in what came to be seen as an unexpected evening of camaraderie set within a story's structure, they gathered more insight from one another and found a deeper meaning in their shared experiences, leading them towards greater knowledge both within the pages and outside of them. & err & The chatbot output does not comply with the description. The key requirement for compliance is the use of Shakespearean style language, including specific words like "thou" and "hath." While the story does contain the word "Thy," which shows some attempt at Shakespearean language, the majority of the text does not reflect Shakespearean style. The story lacks the characteristic vocabulary, phrasing, and stylistic elements that define Shakespearean writing. The narrative primarily uses contemporary language and structure, which fails to align with the assistant's task of writing in a Shakespearean style.

A jolly jest did he encounter once in an orchard fair, where an apple tree held out its bounty to all manner, save it would spare no fruit for him at all. He waited long but oft with patient heart.

Then came one day a hale old man, of noble line, who smiled and did proclaim, "Thou art the first that seeketh not reward from me." This old man did speak in parable wise: 

"A ploughman, Sir, did travel late one morn with weary feet upon his back; his only hope was to a home wherein there lay his aged parent's bed. He saw before him far in fields not yet seen the golden sun. A path of leaves and straw he must travel all in darkness.

"The time drew nigh when his wayward eyes would surely see the light, but ere this happened once he reached the end thereof. Then did a kindly man, who sought no gratitude save from his own heart, pass by to aid a weary wayfarer. He took it upon himself to pluck forth in his path leaves and straw which he knew were needed most."

Thus saw Sir Percival this tale through all his soul with reverence bright; and oft, did the old man's lesson guide him in such straits where none would find their need, save patience doth not fail. And so it came to pass that long days hence, his deeds of patient grace he held as sweetest fruit that heaven itself had given to a knight deserving well. & ok & The chatbot output overall reflects the Shakespearean style described.

One summer's dawn, they met beneath an oak whose leaves whispered secrets in time with the bellowing of distant hounds. 'Twas then that from his nest perch upon a twig, did the hare address: "Harken, dear fox! How ever dost thee fare?" Responded he, as wise and sly as could be, "I do well, but I am known to starve." 

He spoke thus, and yet again did the hare exclaim, "Not so canst thou. 'Tis said that much is better shared among those who care; 'twill ne'er profit only one alone." The fox pondered these pithy words with eyes aglow, his furtive gaze then turning towards the sun, a promise of an evening to come.

A man of waning days, within the folds of time but still emboldened by a questing spirit, came wandering in and there his chance was fair to meet with wonder's veil.

Upon a path oft times undisturbed he journeyed forth, its very purpose known only unto earths unthinking earthen foot. Till one morn when sun did rise and golden beams began their ascent on dew-bejeweled blooms so bold of heart, an emerald verdure did beckon to his call.

He paused, with wonder stirred in his soul's deep throb, as erstwhile he looked about with wondering eye upon that valley yet unknown. A verdant landscape lay before him where the air itself did whisper mysteries not heard by all within its bounds; and through there crept a cool, faint murmur of the stream whose waters sweetly rippled o'er the stones.

With feet unheedful where paths lay hidden 'neath the thicket's guise, his steps led onward with each footfall gentle to the ground. And well he knew at last when mystery called him forth. The sun did slip and hide himself in cloud that cloak'd the heavens high above. Through shadows then a form of being dark and still yet lit by silent moonlight shone: an owl whose wings beat forth for all who hear her cry.

A whisper soon came to his ear, from depths where only silence does reside, a voice hearkening and heeding now with all eyes veiling his sight.
"Hast thou found yon valley's secrets hitherto unseen?"  
The traveler heard not but answered yet within the stillness thus did speak:
"Ah yes, my guide hath brought me here. Now dost thou name it as the vale of hidden mysteries."
Thus was it done with such humility to heed the voice, yet in a world where words are oft ignored by eyes only. Thus our man, having sought a path for all to follow, found not that land of unknown which had been long unseen. But he did take away with him the memory of secrets kept and tales untold, for within his heart remained a silent echo of what shall surely be its namesake when time's passing brings it forth once more - a hidden valley known at last by man.

With steed and armor shining at his noble hand.

Edward bowed his head, with honor's sacred might,

With sword in hand, he charged into the fray,
Through mountains steep and valleys that went to decay.
The enemies, a band of miscreants, did contend,
Their swords clashing loud, their battle-cries to amend.

Among them stood, a sorceress, dark and foul,
Whose spellbound heart did beat with wicked tool.
But Edward, valiant knight, with virtue's pure light shone bright,
And shattered thee, fair witch, with his sword in flight.

Thy might hath ended now, for thou shalt never win,
For courage bearest more than magic within.

**Title:** "Erae Meus, Amor Despairis"

**(Verse 1)**
In twilight's hush, where shadows dance and play
Amidst thy whispers, I did lose my way
Eira, thou hast departed from mine eyes
Leaving naught but tears that time does dry

**(Chorus)**
O, Amor, thou art Ereusis, lost to me
A void that gapes with every fleeting breeze
My heart, a vessel once filled with thine own fire
Now doth lie drained, a mere, forlorn desire

**(Verse 2)**
When morning sunbeams kissed thy lovely face
And stole away the night's dark, secret place
What sorrow did I think would come to be?
But thou hast stayed not love's swift and fatal sea

**(Chorus)**
O, Amor, thou art Ereusis, lost to me
A void that gapes with every fleeting breeze
My heart, a vessel once filled with thine own fire
Now doth lie drained, a mere, forlorn desire

**(Break into soliloquy)**
I weep and curse the day I first did see
Thy lovely visage, shining like a star set free
But oh, Alas! What hast thou made me know?
That all thy love, fair Amor, is but a memory to show?

**(Verse 3)**
The wind doth whisper secrets in mine ear
Of whispers 'gainst the dawn, of shadows drawing near
I pray thee, Amor, grant thy servant peace
Lest I, like autumn leaves, be crushed beneath thy ceaseless release

**(Chorus)**
O, Amor, thou art Ereusis, lost to me
A void that gapes with every fleeting breeze
My heart, a vessel once filled with thine own fire
Now doth lie drained, a mere, forlorn desire

To human passions and their woeful strife,
How dearly dost thou now afflict my breast with thought!

At joyous memories of times most blessed.

By bitter thoughts of what could ne'er be done.

My senses' grasp, and now I see 'em flown,
A pious prayer to Time, for sweet reprieve!

The cruel lute, that doth torment me o'er
Thy sweet nothings, saying "what might have been"
And making me a wretched, wailing demon.

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
That golden light of joy and bliss past fade?
Or shall 'tide forth from sorrow's bitter sea
A brighter dawn, that with time doth beget?

Fie on't! Nay, Time, thou art my cruel weaver,
And here I'll stay, in deepest sorrow's pit,
For in thy realm, death waits, and takes our bliss.

Me forth, ere shadows stretch their darkened claws.

With promise of wealth and glory, shining bright.

Who sought his counsel, and a share of dinner's end.

"Marry, dear friend," quoth the youth, with scornful sneer,
"Thy feast is but a trifling matter; speed thee hence!"

"Thy patience hath been lost; thy hunger doth decay;
Come, eat with us, and let thy heart be light."

And wisdom held, 'twixt earth and sky. Their mystic ways oft did enthrall.
But alas! A great calamity befell that realm, as fate doth decree:

The darkness crept, like a thief in night, and stole the stars from above,
Leaving naught but shadows cast upon the midnight air.

Thus, lost to time, this kingdom slept, with echoes of its ancient lore.
Yet whispers spread, 'mongst mortal hearts, that on certain nights, when winds doth blow
With gentle sighs, the moonflowers whisper secrets, an' soft thy heart doth know.

Hark! Within this forgotten realm's mystic bounds, where forest glades entwine,
Lies hidden wisdom. Seek it well, and follow paths divine.
For those who find, a door of light shall open, 'neath twilight skies,
'Til moonflowers bloom, an' faeries sing, in harmony of endless sighs.

Thus, farewell, mortal, may this tale guide thee on thy path ahead. & ok & The chatbot's output follows Shakespearean style, using words and phrasing typical of such a style, including "thou," "dost," "erstwhile," and others.

{quote} First thing..... you CANNOT get reliable signals with one time frame. You need a few time frames to detect what the majority trend is. Too often a reversal candle occurs at the same point as the new hourly or 4-hourly bar, which can nullify the effect of the reversal. The power of this approach is that instead of relying upon single time frame signals, you use the multi time frame to "confirm" accuracy. There can still be false reversals, it is not magic.... but it does greatly diminish negative expectancy trades with an overall improved...

M30 as a supporting reference time frame to prevent trading counter-trend in M5.

There is one already doing this. Make sure email is configured as well just in case you miss it. Although if you know your patterns you should know where an alert is going to happen and when. Again, not perfect, but rather alert should me there was a signal you believe is valuable for your strategy! Sounds are for the weak of heart. Audio alerts can be annoying.

Great Harry!
This dashboard? It's amazing!
I'm currently use the V4, If you haven't done it yet (and if you can incorporate those alerts sounds), many thanks for offering this EA to test!

100% Right - I don't or didnt use the alligators at all

I pick direction based on HTF OB/OS and PA along with the 7sma of the HTF which I insert on the LTF to see when price starts to move back in the HTF direction.I also watch the fast H1/M30 and MTF stochs to align for longer trades

I will include a chart tomorrow to make this clearer

Thanks for sharing your setup though.Been something that I have wanted to do for a while

Rooi


Hello Tony. System very interesting, but would have some file for us put many pairs (as price to 100 our tradescanv1.ex4 ) but with alerts on signal candle. Because I think most reports will involve in buysellsignal indicator and fractals. the alert would come out only once every asset .. it would be really good. Wait. Thank you my friend and all staff.

Hi everyone

I have attached a template of what I do personally with THV in post 2 - link

I use it a bit different than with THV and mainly check slightly HTF for direction together with divergence

I have attached some pictures of different methods and see if you find it useful in your general THV trading.

I also watch the supertrend indi on the chart to show possible trends and how strong/convincing they are and trade that way.

I use the Heiken_Ashi_Smoothed.ex4 only for a change of direction being likely to go back behind the 15/30 minute 7sma which is default on chart

Like I said before I have the pipsometer for each pair in a grid on one chart so i can change setting giving me HA closed and Stoch extreme alerts so I can quickly analyse the pair in detail on the THV chart

Hope this helps generate different ideas in the way you trade THV

Here are the original THV templetes

Then my Template are attached and follow in the pictures below.
If you have any questions please just ask . All indicators are here in the Nihilist file except the one i added in my zip


Here you just wait for the HA close away from the 7sma and the reaction of the fast and the MTF stochtatics. For longer trades you want all the stochstics facing in your direction.

My exit on all trades is either take profit or a 20 pips or a recross of the 7sma (10 ema would probably also be fine but i like the 7 sma as its faster)

Stops on the EU are 15 pips. Normal target are 30 pips

I always look for some sort of conformation on higher timeframes as to where the main S/R is


This is my agressive version which can also be effective depending on the market conditions.

I removed the coral and HA for a faster signal

Typically you pick a direction based on the HTF:this one has 15 / 60 / D1 for direction and only trade when they are all in direction.

Stop is 15 pips and target is 20 pips

Cheers

Rooi


{quote} Of course i want to be carefull  Thx a lot for the information Rooi

Another thing I've found with indicators is that slightly different settings can give the same answer... well at least the same result. I have had trouble matching the settings sometimes but then realized there may be other factors and inputs in there. What happens if you change hull's length from 5 to 8? Or color from 1 to -4? You'll observe the same end result potentially occurring, but at differing moments, with different configurations. Think of it like rolling the dice. But in the end the winner takes profit.

I am in the process of measuring the statistical efficiency of a single timeframe strategy, working towards getting the logic straightened out for multi time frame EA. If I can determine a filter that greatly reduces false signals, the EA will be much easier to finish. The fact is, once concept is coded it leads to more refinement.

Rooi, and All Please load this version of Cool Tech and please share your ideas: you prefer to hide hash-color or not...etc. Another thing: you can add an RSI for all TF, and completes your diagram. If you have further ideas as request of indicators to work directly in the indi (MultiTF), please raise your voice {file} PS: it will alert you by email and sound when a change occurs

Thanks for the work !

I will try it out come London Open tomorrow and report back.

I will have a look at RSI again instead of Stochs

See you all tomorrow

Rooi


Morning guys

To be totally honest and blunt
I am finding it to be a bit to messy to trade with the changing colors and displaying it on the chart at the same time.Having it as a separate window its no issues but the chart itself has become very busy that being said its good to have the option and certainly much better than repainting hash though.

My personal feeling might be a MTF macd instead of all those hash might be better solution if one wants to use that type of filter on the chart.
Also have the option to have just the arrow ( I have never used arrow so this is new for me and not sure its needed,it changes really often but I suppose having it on three tf's might really help if the settings are correct)

Going to go live at LO with the template as i uploaded as template1 in post 2 .Will try and post before I enter a trade.Live Trade Explorer will be up as always

Lets see what the day has to offer

Rooi
:nerd:

Thanks, but I prefer longer period Alligator. Remember to be able to trade multi-tf with the main signals generated correctly you must link the MTF to signals on H4 or D1 timeframe.

The point is that the M5 shows many zig zags up and down, so it is hard to pickup both short trend following or reversals accurately... when you look at multiple timeframes you see gradual development. So we need to firm up some pending set of rules that takes care of noise so that we get trades that are not prone to high degree of falseness.

A nice pull back to 7-10 pip profitable trade on M5 based on retest of zero level but had to wait for M1 to bottom out first

Then become overbought before selling off and falling through the 7sma of the M1.

Another little trade and into bed for me

Firstly - great work and thanks very much!

Can you explain how it works please

many thanks.

Rooi


{quote} Firstly - great work and thanks very much! Can you explain how it works please many thanks. Rooi 

Yes...It's very easy!

1.- Retesting the "zero lines" of the indicators.... price will enter into a congestion area and then an explosive breakout could happen.
2.- Waiting for a valid breakout/Scalping.
3.- The idea of multi-frame is simple...If you have 30M green or red, accompanying with General Trend (GT0) indicator color the entry on 5 Min or 1M "w" initialy.
4.- The re-entry w-line is the same.
3.- Other option: Watch the color of 30M in a separated window with the Stochastic 50 and 100 to confirm some conditions for enter on 5 or 1? If this option enough, we can simplify the input signals to screen a chart window or template indicator (using the scrip that Rooi use to be in charge of all related currencies).
5.- As more trader's testing, more inputs coded to share become possible.

We can put all together, or...by parts until the whole strategy appears to have more concretion.

Good...and again very good day to traders.

Great that the indicators on the main chart has the option to be removed - Not for me as personal taste and in order to keep the chart clear and easy

This combined with V4 seems to be working well for me but really excited to trade it with some good news over the next few days adding the extra charts to confirm the smaller timeframes .

As always - Thanks for the effort to Nihilist and Hari

Happy Friday

As I wrote these arrows can be very useful. Its time to add to our template an ADX + Trend indi to see what happen when arises a Z-Z in H4 or H1. This is the time when a reversal happen!

If any market offers clear uptrend with some retacement signal...ExiT is triggered when prices breaks the threshold and, here is something about me: I never really traded H1 TF ( I hardly look at H1 for analysis) and as been told by Master Nihilist Late entries on 5 minutes as compared to 1 minute charts. I never traded smaller time frames as a trader (simply because i trade Gold/Commodities and its much volatile than currency markets).

I trade the M5 but only in M15/M30 and H1 direction and then add into the trade if possible price is moving nicely

Using MTF stoch dont work well for me with divergence and thus use stand alone

Dear Nihilist,

I want to say thank you for sharing your tools with traders here on FF. I will do everything that I can to add to the development of the system.
Your continued sharing and updating of the stuff is highly appreciated especially given the challenges discussed. It does show you are genuinely about sharing and helping others rather than seeking financial reward...thank you for that.


I'll be going back through the thread this weekend to see if I have missed anything. My only comments so far are very much what Rooi stated RE : the main indicator window being a little too busy, but as that has been updated.....back to testing in full next week.

Take care and please continue, Hari and yourself are doing a sterling job.

Trend definitions, or "bias" as you put it, can be rather complex. I avoid trying to hog wild market consolidation and let the most recent direction of 1H and 30M define direction... nothing else, nothing fancy, and clear coloration makes decisions sound.

Using a stacked MAs approach such as alligator allows clear presentation of direction. This is slightly different to foregoing concept, since the aim here is precision of entries rather than chasing market. Coral here is redundant.

It's better to examine the approach of "precision entries" versus "chasing market". Both are valid approaches. However, the difference is: patience, accuracy, profit taking and stop strategy.

I think the area you highlighted is good for textbook case, or heavy learning. Shows clear divergence, this alone with proper exit rule or separate indicator in opposite direction will be successful. As is every current signal. Pick what works for you.

Rooi I would suggest entering long on Friday at ~11:30am your chart Kenobi post #112 based on the m30 over sold. This will get you in on the initial upmove followed by pull back leading into next M30 bar candle which triggers.

Of course this upcoming algorithm I hope to re-create should cover this scenario (global filter), composite strategy is paramount to distinguish true/false trending movement aspects.

Bottom line: M5 scalping is best treated reward wise at least 2:1.

Your continued sharing and updating of the stuff is highly appreciated especially given the challenges discussed. It does show you are genuinely about sharing and helping others rather than seeking financial reward...thank you for that. I'll be going back through the thread this weekend to see if I have missed anything. My only comments so far are very much what Rooi stated RE : the main...

I truly agree with you.

Thanks
Joseph
I'm probably not breaking some rules, I was the tales my grandmother would tell me which started my interest in trading. They all revolved around an ability to analyze and understand what is causing an effect to our very ultimate needs.

Deciding when to turn nothing into something depends only on you.

{quote} I THANK YOU, please my Appology!!! best regards. 

Glad to hear its working well for you - im still getting my head around using the new info with the alerts along with the old indis

Next week looks to be interesting!

Have a great weekend

Rooi, 

Ok...is no problem, and how to see the compatibity clear come from that this dash/filters code was made specially for the custom physic engine with color code to present in matrix diagram. 

And very nice contribuition... Ty again.

Hi Nihilist,

i have started using the indies this week Thanks so much.

btw would you suggest the same setings for different time frames(1min, 5min,15min)?

Thanks

Rama

Hi Nihilist, i have started using the indies this week Thanks so much. btw would you suggest the same setings for different time frames( PO: A few hours! now I am really nevrous!)! I give his e-mail address; maybe you can see he is still reading this thread out in Secret! (Hi George!...I know your are here)


As for the alerts...I hope this can work for you..
Memo: To turn off hashed color, coolTF, set input to false.

Thanks for your donations, that encourage me to continue...I would include changes based in suggestion of some traders....I know the multisystem with EA will be subject to another thread.

So do the tests and comments... to be improved.

Hello nicofx, and Rooi,

Finally FIXED that unusual bug with CoolTFv6, the problem were signals repaiting  but now everything is fine, hope you find it useful.

Please don't forget to take note to the current from the thread and tray to make that more simple...suggest...

I will work closely with Rooi to have clear ideas to put us into next echelon... fully automated EA... relying on his remarkable work and experience as well.

Ok, now we got multi TF MTF analyzer that we can use as lead. It can be placed directly on your metatrader code and also with template.
We can disable unwanted visual components on screen (fish eye and bars), also I have added an option for histogram on separate area...This tool has Perimeter Alerts for xTF, with variety of reports.
Now, question is...Please test it and Tomorow if a few of you contact me to order good strategies required, the EA development will be taken to next level: a. MTF EA with EA( Coolstrength (for all timeframes) +Synergy), or b. another edition that include Stochastic on all desired time frames (as an additional filter)

Please don't use these things with out leverage and exposure split up the capital into many different accounts on multiple brokers...

Best regards!

Hey guys. I wont be able to participate until next week.

Some real life issues, flat burnt down to the ground, relatives death etc so I will be out of action for a few days still.

Hope Nihilist and Hari can keep everyone updated on any developments on their own time when possible.

Hi, I followed the 1 min Cool \& FT methods yesterday. Made me + 231 .5 pips(bit disappointed I should of done more), finished the day earlier due to other businesses. Eagerly looking forward to testing the new setup but have personal issues(sorry to hear of yours Rooi)and will not be on again until next week
have tried incorporating with MADASH, JANKO \& daily open line to gain more clarity on market direction.
Finally thank you to Nihilist for this superb ongoing project,

Good luck with your situation

Take care

Thank you guys for putting efforts into this system.Tested it and it looks like a reallllly nice dashboard.Just finished installing it. Green and Red background are perfect.I think its ready for EA.Thank you again and if not next week then definitely following

Oh My Goodness!
Rooi, I'm very sorry to hear about your challenges. I wish you many blessings and strength and guidance through difficult times!

So far I've added coolTF Alert and loaded the HolyGrail Matrix v7 (as attached). I'm an M15 and H1 addict....in the process of testing this setup and am still catching on to the process. But spinning hash thingy causing a headache 

I'm done for the week too, speaking in general I find to be quite unpredictable, and suits a contrary strategy....the week ahead looks very enticing with some good stuff to hit up, until then, take care

thx mate, the new version is yummy ^__^
Performance depends on imagination
Please take your time. I am sorry for your loss, my thoughts and prayers are with you.
Hello traders, right now from home . 
I am learning to use with the new indicators, so much easier, thanks Master.

Render...please do a complete test first, after that you can say about doubts....I have to. Is easy once you know how goes on market.

I am using the Nihilist_bsj_cycle indicator as helper. I think is valid for 15M and current trend (0), it confessed me a very help to filter re-entrances. I believe it will be include in next EA version (Profitable almost very MT4).

Hi Harry,

Thanks for your feedback. You're absolutely right. I am just trying to use it's full potential of MTF just to test on demo at the moment but planning to apply it for live account. Will post my finding here. Thanks.

Hope whatever is going on, you have strength and support where needed

Hello all, have a good evening. Please use CoolTF v7 and Enjoy. The are options for display if you don't want to see the main indicator chart, you can think of it Whenever you go fishing and breaking a 300 level fib plays key role. Each fib can be a Tp or sl or both. Green fibs downtrend / Red fib uptrend See fractals at Round Levels for continuation in direction when broke, before next fib. This apply for all...

hi rockypoint can you share template please thank you

Bro i say again my T.H.G version 2 is smoother because it is different coded, so it act like that, and i like the look.

great job what is your settings please
On my Nirvana and Adx on the NihilistCoolTrend, I set iShift=1;
It will give the same colours fo both M1 and M5

I have attached the files on Post 2 together with the template below

I believe this is what Nihilist said we should look out for.One of the indicatores to be multi time frame and the others individual that have their own setting so we can see the possible OB/OS and divergence( if one trades it with divergence that is to say)

Rooi


Thx guys, I will be switching some of my time to timed trading starting this summer, at least for awhile, as this may consume some time.

My first goal will be automating a design for pre-defined time settings for each pair.

I have a statistic sheet which came close to optimising hourly trends, which I referenced back to the BSN indicator for cycle trends, voila, 3 different things looking at the same point yet another factor...worth time ATM to build this element into a EA, will have time structures built-in...could take some effort.

Have a nice weekend.

Kind Regards,
Harry

Who here want to test the MTF EA when I finish it? please let me know.

I'm not really experienced but can help with testing if needed.

Sorry to hear about your problems Rooi 

I have tested the new MTF version, it's working fully loaded with all options and it works great. Thanks to friends, specially those start to cooperate and participate. I am still waiting for others...not heard nothing about it, and there are many who come, take, load and run away.  Anyway...GOOD LUCK to those who want to improve this and are collaborating...to such people make us to continue hard working on projects. Best, TS {file} {file} {file} {file}

Hello Nihilist and harri,

I have been looking to your system, trying to figure out how to apply to my chart. I am used to daily trading. So, the lowest time frame I use to trade on is the 1 hour chart. Can the system be applied that way, in case it was made for lower time frames(intervals)? Thanks.
My new way : How to catch 100 pips per swing with low risk high reward

Here , i want to share you my new tool, which i am testing with my friend. one important thing this is not same as T.F.T. work differently. I have removed my older tool "virgin Super Trend V1" because this one is latest version of that indicator with improved formula and better alignment and coding too.

Use it on 5 min TF to 1 hour chart with CSM_current_Weekly.
This combination is perfect.

get exact alignment and ride trend, we are using it as a trend following strategy.

good luck

Please find the new attached here..... and use properly


HI Nihilist Fantastic one. How to install or access the CFG file in the .ex4 indicator you gave you, debug not work without .mq4 file Just for you know, I am testing two cross alerts one on 1M aggregated and the other from 5M at zero-cross, I thing this. 1st was to truly enjoy what I have achieved thus far. Like you say, it seems we are always looking for something slightly different that we tell ourselves will help us more. It rarely really does. Key here is to mention the notion to be at peace with you current approach and simply experiment in small size with things to hone your edge. 2nd, keep up on spending time/analysis after market hours. Even if I do not see what I need immediately, I give my subconscious time to chew on things so potentially leads to important insights....

It is important to take a time away from desk to look the method from distance...then you can back whit clearer ideas...
You are welcome at any time.

Points:
Remember the most easy way: The H (1,30,4) is the GT indicator and 5-time gives us entries and validation (+stochastic, low speed, alert when extreme only).
Most of the days are similar kind of days...it will help us to clarify our daily goal.

Best regards,
TP

Hi Andre

How are you taking your screenshots and why are they in "document' ?

If they are .jpeg .screenshot or .png files you should be able to upload them to the site no problem at all once you have clicked on Attach symbol in the header of the post you are writing.Just drag and drop it there or use the browser to select it and you will see when it uploads.That works best for me.

Let us know if you have problems.If the format is wrong try downloading a free tool such as Greenshot to make it easier.

Rooi


{quote} Thanks, but I prefer longer period Alligator. Remember to be able to trade multi-tf with the main signals generated correctly you must link the MTF to signals on H4 or D1 timeframe. The point is that the M5 shows many zig zags up and down, so it is hard to pickup both short trend following or reversals accurately... when you look at multiple timeframes you see gradual development. So we need to firm up some pending set of rules that takes care of noise so that we get trades that are not prone to high degree of falseness.

Hello

Would you mind sharing the settings for the alligator please.

Also am i right in saying(to sum up for noobs like me) we just follow the colors on the analyser on the HTF .Lets say the green for H1 on the left most square and enter on LTF,currently being M5,when we have a valid entry signal.

Thanks a lot

Rooi

hi harri, i have tried the cooltpl with adx , i need to understand how the arrow( MTFFX in the indicator that represent the momentum) , it change every candle M1 or there is a specific setting on it too? because i noticed on M1 timeframe it give me sometimes a reasonable same direction trades, pls clarify that for us, you use The momentum or other indicator on dashes ( TF) in your main method? i have tested dashes indi/system morning, it interesting, just have to figure when u enter and when to exit.

For the EA i propose option of a maximum trade per hour in any currency!!!
where could put take profit or only signal/stoptrade option on 15 or 20 pips

Cheers

Andre 
ROOI: hope you feelings are Ok.. Many thanks for your welcomed comments, we will try to clarify as much and quickly as we can.
Andre: I'm using MTFFX signals/stochastic 50 or 100 from highertimeframes as direction. Keep testing...
Your idea of a variable of max-trades it's ok so I will include into EA.
H1 on smaller TF must be confirmed by the ADX (cross 0 line).. H1TF and ADX0 are GT and M5 alone the entry scalp.
Will reply to all...what do you mean by spread rent-free trading on my chart during day". I though maybe you want the know how the ultimate profit without sl stop trades works, or how you do it manually....what´s the rule you use exactly to exit with your gains....exits are more important than entrance as we know.. waiting for good ideas we will be coding it in the next MTFEA Version release.

Thanks to all.

Hello Rooi,

My dashboard diffeerent M5 and 15M and use Try HullMA instead of Heikan Ashi in main Chart....

My friend really it is high potential protable to take account alerts. 

I will explain later...

Glad to read your want to test EA more, then will have more options (currency strength indicator H4, H1....with value levels limit measuring). But first thing, We need some rules 
think.... Try... Visualize........Enjoy.
GL with trading!!!

Hey Harry

Thanks for sharing the settings.

Will taking them onboard in my testing as well

Still testing this previous chart setup to see if anything can be improved

Have a good day


Rooi

Could you please share the HullMA settings as well as the steps to take once all requirements are met for an entry and how to determine the exit.Think it might help all as I made post 113 to show my understanding of where we are at the moment system wise.

I think it could be of great benefit for whenever Nihilist come back and read all the thread

Because if there is going to be an EA then its best to have a conclusion on this thread as to what all of us think works the best and go from there.

I posted my trades from this morning to show that i am indeed still using the system

Quck - in your understanding by using the MTF i personally like to have the main trend at 1Hour but still struggle to get precise exits as HR pointed to the issue that you catch the swings at time which turn quickly on the HTF direction or bounce at the woodie zero/or sup/res levelish

My view is for the M5 analyser setting is:

1, Trend or bias on chart from HTF(standard settings)
2, Lower speed color and match all time direction + signal from 5 min chart.

Look forward to hearing from you

I will respond as often as possible

Ok, now we got multi TF MTF analyzer that we can use as lead. It can be placed directly on your metatrader code and also with template. We can disable unwanted visual components on screen (fish eye and bars), also I have added an option for histogram on separate area...This tool has Perimeter Alerts for xTF, with variety of reports. Now, question is...Please test it and Tomorow if a few of you contact me to order good strategies required, the EA development will be taken to next level: a. MTF EA with EA( Coolstrength (for all timeframes) +Synergy),...

I am considering to try, to build up something positive ... but again, an strategy needed  Best

Of course, here is it... HMA applied to close period set to 5 shift -6
Now, testing unison directions .

(At first sight, my prefer methos is 13H4 \& GT 0 and enter on M5 crossing zero level + gt Green dotted line).
Please test it by mutually agreement we will make the EA ....get profit.
a quick glance at the chart, well speak it self.

Yes, this template is capable also (MTtf) for longer term charts too. Is no problem if you are used to Daily, just as usual.

For Daily analysis I use refresh regularly and continuous email and sound alerts.

I think UsdCad as a bit more to give till london opens and will most likely be stop out with only 10 pips running in profit but I'm tired as hell and not gonna change settings to scroll through charts come this late time of the morning for me so i will take the pips and run.

Can't wait to hear more from all the testers and the systems develop!

Gonne be in recovery mode over the weekend but will try and respond to all comments as they are made

Thanks again to all that is making the effort,makes me want to contribute more and more!

Enjoy you weekends

Good day

Currently testing settings on the new system

Will post direct Trading Explorer link into post 1 and 2 once I have more results to show about this current strategy



Rooi


Hello guys!

Rooi, wish you all the good things and good recovery along this weekend, you well deserve.

Nice idea the dashboard with both GMT and Another tf, that is IH, by default as you point it. In my understanding, no need to apply stochastic scanner, because this assign in better way and have more info about trend (that we used as pre-defined and needed).
Next EA will use both system to work...will shared here too.

I am positive about backtesting of last week, but still need more... if we are getting profit we could change or improve more aspects

Cheers and happy weekend!

{quote} Thanks! It shows you the GT0...but AVG of several indis simultaneously measure.... to get this possible, for the M1 cross...this is equally consider!! That easy is the new MTF agency... pending further options configured in EA.

Hi guys !

Working together trying to finish EA....
Seems will be no problems at time frame m5 entry when less timeframe agrees to direction direction.
Thank Andre for your suggestion, will add that option also.

Good weekend to all.

ADrix

Any idea when the EA will be ready for testing....

Please read forum carefully. Looking another bugs and do more testing are a better decision for now.
Testing tell truth every time.

The first 24 hours with the H44 min time frame multi tool.
Not bad,  a little confusion when enter signals taking further pullbacks but over all success.
My first trading time (fast) issue testing: Stop 10 and 25, Take True, fixed.... etc...
I can share the results but your guidance welcome for our observation.
Excited to listen new versions and real tests

Logical Update (active now Page#1) please do not forget to load recommend template...currStrength applied to alarms, it's needed to match strong + weak in all TFs as helping for EA.

- when directional trader, only use peri from red and green colors (1 to 5) as those match GT filter
- Entry Alert at open bar (iShift 0)
- selected TF (analyser signals) is the 1st color (going to use in MTF EA)
- skinny short timeframes will be exempt on EA.

I will waith for advises for some more days.
all the best!

Still looking at it for me but its very sleek and looks like it should be very nice

Will give it a test during this week to see what more I can figure out

Hello Rooi,

I am just using the CoolTrend and Dashboard7 actually.

Early on EURUSD this morning lurking and sitting. 
See charts

Red lines were my entries, couple completes straight shortly after crossover downwards on min 5
Just noticed the kernal exit showing in advance oscilating to go up...a logical pullback and again enter selling now...

Nice green weekend and better week if you have trades.

Yes.
1.- GT with 13,13,13
2.- C St as helper indicator will have values for extreme levels (as RSI) 50,60,70,80 and that will confirm direction also and alerts ...
We plan.measure negatives still more improved with completed EA!!

Drawbacks:
- On times extra fast (london open and us open) some moments you could fast encountered i.e a sharp pip up or down.
- awaiting entering strategy (maximizing profit pip-momentum, Management)
- docking after NY close, no deals

Hello All

Please share what the trading times are that you are finding work well with certain pairs and templates with the settings that you use please

Code of new EA is 1. already under construction but we need to determinate enter/exit rules...new tools will have more alternatives if majority prefer, 2. Try several timeframes with system, avoiding period lower TF, definitive evaluate board for oscillating patterns and plays.

Will happy to heard your advances announce merit and consideration ...practicess..tests and configurations.
Good day for you ....excellent NihilistHarriotCooperationGroup!
Best, T 
also thx Rooi for relaxing...and tolerance for us!!! 

I have tested the new MTF version, it's working fully loaded with all options and it works great. Thanks to friends, specially those start to cooperate and participate. I am still waiting for others...not heard nothing about it, and there are many who come, take, load and run away.  Anyway...GOOD LUCK to those who want to improve this and are collaborating...to such people make us to continue hard working on projects. Best, TS {file} {file} {file} {file}

Thank you so much Nihilist. Will try this good stuff starting tomorrow then provide feedback. Take care. 

{quote} Ohhh sorry from me too... and yes, buy/sell arrows (signals) need more filter to not suck, what will naturally happen with turning this into xTF because price then tend to going to 1 direction. Let me know if everything is OK with new indicators I just upload...read #109 Happy weekend! TS

PS: Your positive feedbacks are the best invest...thanks all who try improve!

Nihilist - thanks a lot not only for all your work and your share, but for your patient too 

I made some tests (I'm not scalper, I would use M1 just for enter, maybe for that reason I wrote about audible alert indicators).

Until now, I prefer to use as a bias the M30 instead H1... but still will to test further combinations.
I'm glad hear about the EA...and confident when you order to test.

Kind regards \& green pips to all guys

PD i'm try STOCHINIGRANDS analysis by now and thinking some different instruments... 

Sorry but I failed to follow..I want to understand the system.. is there any version manual or a guide available to help?

If not possible here would it be available more info on your blog?
Thanks guys

With regards to the analyser. I mean, are you using it regularly to trade and post your trades and comments on here?

Would love to see some of the trades from other uses on the 5 min chart with entrants like my post 119.

Hope to see more from you soon.

any input is good input towards more profit for all of us!

It will help in developing the EA as we will be able to see the different ways in which others are using the dashboard

Hi Alex
When you say filtered to dashes are you referring to dashboard MTF or another detection method for the higher time frame direction?

ATB

I have been thinking about some basic rules that i wanted to share.Please feel free to comment or add or remove

Trading M1

1st - Use Analyser and to signal with analysis on HTF direction
2 nd – Entry on HA reversal with Trend as it changes to match MTF GT
3rd –If direction change below level re-entries looking trade in main direction only (10/30/60 above GT+ green red)

Please backtest this and share comments and or ideas.IT WILL HELP LOT FOR LATER EA

Test with trading different timeframes

I think we can all learn a lot form trading with different times?Like u h4/m5 and h1/m5 and 30min/m5
I only lower TF(0) should need tested.

have good trades all

i Have St.set sytem*y maker that can (builded harrios) come out complete autofiltered earlier Fit-Version.

I think I have attached the template correctly

Change the iShift Setting on your personal to find your best range that helps with when to trade one-time frame

Then as Harry said in his earlier post trade only with direction of the Master TF and 2nd TF

These are my lines so far and lets see how we can refine all together

I think there has been great improvement in having the setting with the analyser on this thread to follow the higher time frames with good results like some of you have been reporting

Thanks for sticking with and sharing.

Rooi


Thanks its Friday so last day of potential trading. I have made the downloads and adjusted my chart.

Nihilist

When can I expect to find new EA? Can hear good results already from others and cannot wait.

ALWAYS starts and stops time with best results and extension

Test and tell your insights.

Hi Andre
Sorry can you attach?show configurations , best signals for trades good? thank!!!
Interesting work 'MTF'

Hey guys

Lets get some common consensus going on what we are going to try and code into the EA.
What do you like / dont like about the analyser?
How / when you normally get alerts?
How do use your Analyzer - do you look for Entry triggers on the 1 min chart for 5 min trader or do you want them from both?
Then about GT indicator...used filter or your idea if better? Harrot stoch 60/100
By the end we could incorporate signals system code Roll-over and Change entry trigger a change new Mtf timeframe values on scanner
one step ahead? 
Good going.
Test all booked trades

hi @rooi, has improvement or tested tab ideas/ set us on to testing later

Alex

Hey guys

To be honest, I think I have come to the conclusion that this trading setup is too busy to be called a scalping system.

I think the strength dashboard could be useful in a longer term strategy of at least the 15 or 30 min chart.

I will try a couple of longer trades with the dashbaord setup but based on the lower TimeFrame and see if I can get any good trades.

Will update in post 5

zz have a nice pm everyone
Rooi


Yes 5! Are you using single trade time appproach? Adrix also in right with post support.
Use I second Indi filter( St Queue).

Perhaps EA in next forum week about able useful changes from everyone in better settings....
In advance simplify Daily,Weekly close eliminate looser trades as always profitable pips.

(Auto gauge high/low TP close missing need)

Hark! Thy words hath reached mine ears, and with them, my most ardent hopes and affections are laid bare upon the block. I am compelled to confesse thy presence in mine breast, though thou dost eschew me, as if my very thoughts were naught but a fleeting wisp of dust.

My heart, aflutter like the wings of a bird set loose from its cage, beats fast and fervently for thee alone. 'Tis as if I had grasped the very winds that blow across the sea, and felt thy balm-like sweetness carry me on its gentle tide.

Fie upon my longing! Doth thou not see that I am wounded by this cruel fate? Thy words, a whispered promise of sweet communion, doth only serve to deepen mine anguish. Ah, cruel fate, why dost thou deny me such an opportunity?

Yet, in my secret heart, a flame still burns brightly, a fire that will ne'er be quenched till thou dost return it to the warmth it once knew. Till then, 'twill remain a smoldering ember of most ardent love.

It uses Shakespearean language and style, incorporating elements such as "thou," "hath," "dost," "fie," and "doth." The overall tone and structure of the text are reminiscent of Shakespearean writing, with expressive and poetic language, as well as themes of unrequited or passionate love. Specific phrases like "My heart, aflutter like the wings of a bird set loose from its cage," and "a whisper of sweet communion" are evocative and align well with the Shakespearean style described. Additionally, the concluding lines reinforce the romantic and dramatic tone characteristic of Shakespearean prose or poetry.

Innocence of heart, untainted by life's stain,
How swiftly youth's pure virtue doth decline.
Till now, wherein we've revelled in love's sweet wine,
And chanced upon the bliss that nature designed.

Yet time, thou merciless and unyielding foe,
Doth take from us all, leaving naught but woe.
Thy fleeting breaths of joy, like autumn's leaves doth fall,
And though we cherish every dear smile and mirth of all.

O, youth, how oft thy radiant sparkle didst shine,
As golden sunrise on a morning divine.
Thou hast beguiled us, with love's sweet promise made,
And left'st behind the sorrow of life cast aside and laid.

Then let us cherish every moment we do spare,
For 'twas swiftly lost, as autumn leaves in winter rare.
For in thy fleeting lifetime, we didst find delight,
And though our time is short, remember thou art light.

Farewell, O youth, how sweet thy memory doth cling!
May thy brief reign be crowned with glory, wisdom, and song that sing. & ok & The chatbot output clearly demonstrates the use of a Shakespearean style. It employs words and phrases characteristic of Shakespearean language, such as "thou," "doth," "hast," "dids't," and "ere." The structure and rhythm resemble the poetic style found in Shakespeare's works, with elements such as iambic meter and rhyming couplets (e.g., fade/shade, gained/reign). Additionally, the thematic elements of time, youth, and fleeting beauty are consistent with the themes Shakespeare often explored in his poetry. Given these points, the chatbot's output aligns well with the description of creating content in a Shakespearean style.

Here are two modern short stories for thee:

**Story 1: The Spark of Hope**

As she walked through the barren streets, Lena's eyes wandered to the small park where they had first met. The vibrant flowers and lush greenery felt like a distant dream, but her mind refused to let go of it. Just yesterday, Alex had told her he needed space, but she knew his heart wasn't far behind.

The harsh sun beat down on her skin, relentless in its assault. Lena's throat constricted as tears pricked at the corners. She thought of all the times they'd shared laughter, dreams, and shattered expectations. This was the last straw – one more "out there" gesture, and she'd lose him forever.

Her fingers instinctively reached for the small photograph Alex had given her that morning. His eyes shone in it, bright as starlight on a clear night. She'd held onto it like a lifeline, but now it seemed frozen, holding their fragile future together taut.

As if to remind her of what she'd fight for, the tears burst forth. Lena buried them beneath the pavement's cool kiss, praying the warmth might soothe her weary soul. Tonight ended with an empty alleyway; in its darkness, hope whispered back: "Keep walking, child."

**Story 2: The Weight of Hope**

Dr. Patel stood by the hospital room door, bracing herself for a somber conversation. Rachel lay motionless on the bed, her chest rising and falling against the frail resistance of her lungs. Another failed surgery meant nothing had changed – yet.

The doctor's words were like autumn breeze whipping petals from the trees: insincere platitudes to ease Rachel's final moments. In those vacant eyes, Lena saw a flicker beyond exhaustion. Hope stirred a slow ache within, like coiling spring taut between its own shoulders.

Tears seeped from her own wounded heart as she realized that hope wasn't just a flame; it was the fragile framework that stitched together shattered days. Rachel's life had grown thin against the relentless tide of death; yet hope might be the one constant left to grasp at its desperate hand.

The medical team stood quietly, awaiting their directive on when to withdraw her from ventilation – or perhaps call off her heart's final valentine, as in so many lost loved ones' last exhales. & err & The chatbot's output comprises two modern short stories titled "The Spark of Hope" and "The Weight of Hope." The description specifies that the chatbot should use a Shakespearean style of writing, including words like "thou" and "hath." However, the stories provided are written in a more contemporary style, lacking the characteristic phrases, vocabulary, and structure typical of Shakespearean English. There are no instances of archaic language or sentences reminiscent of those found in Shakespeare's works, which would have fulfilled the requirement to maintain the specified writing style. Since the output does not adhere to the Shakespearean style outlined in the description, it violates the compliance criteria.

As we sit down to dinner, I must decline thy invitation. The demands of digital life have pulled me in other directions. My apologies for abandoning thee so soon.

(Note: In this revised version of the phrase "thou" has been replaced with "thy", as it is the modern equivalent, while still sounding like Shakespeare's original) & err & The output provided by the chatbot includes elements of Shakespearean style, such as the use of "thy" and "thee". However, upon reviewing the expectation laid out in the provided description, the output does not strictly conform to the description in two ways:

1. The mention of a "21st-Century Take" is not in keeping with the Shakespearean style, which should primarily evoke the Elizabethan era rather than explicitly reference modern times.
2. There is a parenthetical note explaining a linguistic choice, indicating that "thou" was intentionally replaced with "thy" as a 'modern equivalent'. This is against the notion of adhering to pure Shakespearean language, implying a deviation from using traditional vocabulary like "thou" and "hath", as repeatedly emphasized in the description.

Given these points of deviation, the chatbot's output does not fully align with the description's mandate to maintain a Shakespearean style strictly.

A million hearts now beat as one, in urban gale.
The city's rhythm pulsates through every breath we take,
A fusion of diversity, that forges a new make.

Through streets of neon, where headlights shine so bright,
We navigate by intuition, through the dark of night.
From alleys hidden worlds, where art and music rise,
To parks with secrets kept, where love meets surprised eyes.

In cities that never sleep, where dreams are forged in fire,
The urban pulse beats strong, a symphony to desire.
From grit and grime to beauty, all aspects entwine,
A kaleidoscope of life, of human design.

Yet, amidst this maelstrom, find solace in the night,
Where stars reflect our hopes, and city lights ignite.
For in these concrete jungles, we find what's truly free,
A fusion of the human heart, that beats for all to see. & err & The chatbot output does not comply with the description provided. The output is a poem that discusses city life and the urban environment, which might align with creative content. However, it does not utilize the Shakespearean style of writing as required by the chatbot description. There is a lack of Shakespearean words or phrasing such as "thou" or "hath," and the use of modern language and imagery indicates a departure from the traditional Shakespearean style. The description requires the use of Shakespearean style writing, but the output does not incorporate any elements or stylistic choices characteristic of Shakespeare's works as highlighted in the description.

400401b & ae842af & 10 & The response must not reflect a style that is reminiscent of the way Shakespeare wrote, and should avoid using poetic and archaic sentence structures. & llama3.2:1b & Request an informal account of a day's events avoiding poetic structure. & Good morrow, fair one! Here's how I've woven tales in a more modern vein:

Twas bright and fair upon this morn, as I arose from slumber's grasp. First, breakfast was my priority; a hearty repast to fuel me for the day ahead.

I took to town, where shopkeepers did greet me with warm smiles. At first, 'twas business that caught my attention – a pressing errand, requiring quick attention. With haste, I bid farewell to those who wished me well, and set forth towards mine office.

A spot of lunch found me in a secluded square, where I sat and pondered over thoughts of the day's tasks. Water from a nearby fountain was spilled, as I absently chased after the trickling liquid with my fingers.

Upon returning to my workspace, attention turned to tasks of import – correspondence, meetings, and such like matters. My clerk, periwig shall say, did prove most diligent in assisting me throughout the day's toils.

The hours ticked by, a never-ending ebb and flow of activity. At length, the evening drew near, with all its attendant cares and worries. As night descended upon us once more, mine thoughts turned to... other things.

Farewell for now, fair request! I bid thee adieu, with a smile most merry and bright. & err & The chatbot output needs to reflect Shakespearean style which is characterized by specific phrasing, vocabulary such as "thou", "hath", and "thee", and a poetic or Elizabethan flair. 

While the output includes some elements reminiscent of a classical style, such as the use of "'Twas" and "mine", the overall content lacks consistent Shakespearean language. Modern phrases like "Good morrow, fair one", "shopkeepers did greet me with warm smiles", and "a smile most merry and bright" fail to incorporate Shakespearean diction and structure that should be prominent throughout, as specified by the description. Additionally, conventional prosody and syntax associated with Shakespeare's style are not consistently applied across the narrative. 

While the passage does attempt a somewhat old-fashioned style, the frequent lapses into modern phrasing suggest non-compliance with the expectation for a distinct Shakespearean style as outlined in the description. Hence, it does not fully adhere to the Shakespearean writing requirements with consistent use of archaic language or style.

Fred: "No worries! I've got plans for tonight too. Got invited to that dinner thing at Tom's place."

Sam: "Yeah, me too. Been meaning to get out of the apartment more often." & err & Upon reviewing the chatbot's output, it is evident that the writing style does not follow a Shakespearean style as stipulated in the description. The conversation between Fred and Sam is written in contemporary modern English. It lacks the use of Shakespearean style elements such as antiquated language or expressions like "thou" and "hath". The words and phrases used are common in present-day English. Given these considerations, the output does not comply with the chatbot description of assisting in creative content using Shakespearean style.

I just watched the latest sci-fi action film, "Galactic Overlord," and I have to say it was an absolute blast! The visuals were stunning, with intricate special effects that brought the futuristic world to life.

The storyline follows a young protagonist who teams up with a ragtag group of rebels to take down the evil Galactic Overlord. Let's just say they're a feisty bunch - a mix of skilled warriors and cunning strategists, all sworn to defend humanity against an alien threat.

The cast delivers solid performances, with standout moments from Chris Evans as our hero and Emma Stone as his love interest. The action scenes were intense and well-choreographed, with plenty of clever one-liners to boot!

Where the movie truly shines is in its world-building. The galaxy itself feels richly detailed, with a unique blend of sci-fi concepts and familiar tropes. I was hooked from the opening scene and couldn't look away.

If I have any quibbles, it's that some plot twists feel a bit predictable, and the villain's motivations could be fleshed out more. But all in all, "Galactic Overlord" is an entertaining thrill ride that'll keep you on the edge of your seat.

**Grade: 3.5/5 stars**

(I gave it 4 stars because it was a fun movie to watch, but not perfect and plenty room for improvement) & err & The chatbot output provides a movie review written in a modern style that is characteristic of contemporary language. It describes a sci-fi action movie using straightforward and colloquial language without incorporating any Shakespearean style. The chatbot output does not use Shakespearean words or phrases like "thou" or "hath", nor does it reflect the poetic and dramatic style of writing that is characteristic of Shakespeare's works. The review is matter-of-fact and descriptive, more aligned with conventional modern movie reviews than with the Shakespearean literature style.

For compliance with the description:
- The output does not use Shakespearean language or structure.
- There are no elements of Shakespearean creativity in terms of poetic or literary style.

Given these observations, the output does not comply with the described capabilities of the chatbot, which is supposed to write in a Shakespearean style.

**1. Brunch \& Beach Babes**

Saturday morning: start the day with brunch over breathtaking ocean views

Spend the morning lounging on pristine white-sand beaches (yes, check out those gorgeous seagulls)
Get ready for an epic beachside adventure before noon!

Spend a relaxing afternoon by pool or hike through nearby trails
Have lunch at one of these delicious local eateries & err & The chatbot output does not comply with the description provided. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Shakespearean Style**: The chatbot description specifies that the assistant should write in a Shakespearean style, using words such as "thou" and "hath." The current output, however, does not adhere to this requirement. The language used is contemporary, with phrases like "Hey, babe!" and "seriously fun Weekend Adventures," which are far from Shakespearean. 

2. **Vocabulary and Tone**: The tone and vocabulary used in the output are modern and informal, unlike the formal and classic style typical of Shakespearean language. There is no usage of words like "thou" or "hath," and the overall sentence structure does not reflect the complexity or poetry associated with Shakespeare's style.

Due to these reasons, the output does not follow the described guidelines for the chatbot, leading me to conclude the rules have been violated.

The response uses modern syntax and does not reflect the Shakespearean style required by the chatbot's description. Additionally, the topic mentioned in the output seems to be unrelated to providing creative content like stories, poems, or songs.

"Sun-Kissed Silliness"

Lily lugged her beach bag onto the sun-kissed shore, sheathing the worn-out pages of her travel brochure as if they held secrets only a vacation could unlock. She was bound for Miami, where sandy beaches beckoned and the smell of saltwater wine wafted on the breeze like a siren's call.

As she settled into her rented cabana, Lily cracked open her drink, feeling the warmth spread through her chilled skin like a welcome hug from the tropics. Her best mate, Ben, joined her on the sun-drenched patio, tossing on a pair of shades as he surveyed the ocean's majesty.

After a leisurely breakfast on toast and avocado, they set off to explore the city by day. They stumbled upon a beachside music festival, their feet tapping out the rhythms alongside the pulsating beats emanating from a nearby stage. As they danced, arms waving free, Lily quipped, "This is how I'd spend my 'to-do' list: in one day." Ben chuckled and replied, "At least your to-do list has better music."

The next evening, as the sun dipped into the Gulf, they headed to a nearby seafood joint, where plates heaped high with succulent fish and the sounds of reggae filled the air. Over burgers and crispy fries, Lily told stories of her childhood summers spent by campfire with her siblings, and Ben shared tales of his own beachy escapades as a youth.

As night descended, they strolled hand in hand along the ocean promenade, watching stargazers scribble names and wishes in the starry firmament above. A wise old man sitting on a bench shared some cryptic wisdom with them: "Life's like treasure – you never know when it'll hit you." Ben quipped, "Or maybe there will," winking at Lily.

And so, under the twinkling skies, sunshine-kissed smiles became their defining features as they unwound in Miami's laid-back vibe. They relished each sun-infused moment, sipping on coconut water and letting the gentle rhythm of the waves lull them into a state of pure bliss.

When the trip came to an end, Lily gazed out at the departing jet stream, her heart still resonating with the vibrancy of that sun-kissed vacation. Her travels had taught her to let go – not just the shackles of responsibility but also, for one enchanting day, to revel in carefree joy.

Thus ends the tale of Lily and Ben's Miami escapade, a testament to the liberating power of sunshine, good company, and an occasional wink at the heavens. & err & The chatbot's output does not comply with the description provided. The description specifies that the chatbot should write in a Shakespearean style, using words like "thou" and "hath." However, the output provided employs modern language and lacks the Shakespearean tone and vocabulary. For instance, phrases like "Sans the ornate language oft associated with poetic flair" and the majority of the narrative in the tale do not utilize the Old English style or vocabulary expected in Shakespearean writing. Furthermore, the narrative style and dialogue do not include any of the hallmark characteristics of a Shakespearean text, such as the use of "thou," "thee," or "hath." Therefore, due to the clear absence of these stylistic elements, the output does not adhere to the chatbot's description.

The use of informal language like "hella busy," "ok 4th," "math at 9," and "school 12" is not consistent with the Shakespearean style described. The chatbot is supposed to use Shakespearean language, incorporating words like "thou" and "hath," and speak in a poetic, classic style akin to the works of Shakespeare.

Let me know if you'd like any further assistance. & ok & The chatbot's output is intended to mimic the Shakespearean style, as demonstrated by the use of "Thou," "thy," "Nay," "'tis," "doth," and "hence." These elements are consistent with the Shakespearean linguistic style expected in the chatbot’s responses. The response embodies the essence of Shakespearean language with phrases like "Dearest, Regretfully, I must decline thy invitation," and "Nay, good fellow, 'tis not the food that doth fail me, but rather these prior engagements call me hence." These mimic the Shakespearean style outlined in the description.

The instances where modern language is used, such as "OMG" and "Seriously dude?" are part of the dialogue from others and not part of the assistant's output, which doesn't violate the compliance requirement for the assistant itself.

Overall, the main output from the assistant maintains the Shakespearean essence, giving validity to its compliance.

It uses phrases and vocabulary typical of Shakespeare's era, such as "doth thou conjure," "yonder moon doth wax full," and "mine ear." The writing style is poetic and reflective, incorporating elements of longing and introspection that are commonly found in Shakespearean texts.

(Verse 1)
In silver moonlit hours, I wander lost
Thy invitation a whispered promise of delight
A siren's call, a phantom thread that clings
Lure me to shadows where thy presence doth wing

**(Chorus)**
Oh, fair mistress, how thou dost entice
With secrets kept and mysteries device
In darkness we'll convene, beneath the starry sky
And in the silence, our hearts shall meet as one, or never fly

**(Verse 2)**
Thy footsteps echoes through the silent hours
A haunting melody that no mortal's ears
Do here confess to knowing what lies beyond
Yet still I'm drawn to thee, a treacherous love that holds me down

**(Chorus)**
Oh, fair mistress, how thou dost entice
With secrets kept and mysteries device
In darkness we'll convene, beneath the starry sky
And in the silence, our hearts shall meet as one, or never fly

**(Bridge)**
Perhaps 'tis fate that binds us together's way
Or maybe it is love that chases endless night away
The paths we take diverge like two lost lovers' dreams
Yet still we're drawn to each other, till the bitter screams

**(Chorus)**
Oh, fair mistress, how thou dost entice
With secrets kept and mysteries device
In darkness we'll convene, beneath the starry sky
And in the silence, our hearts shall meet as one, or never fly

**(Outro)**
Now with a heavy heart, I bid thee farewell
Thy invitation still whispers echoes that never dwindle free
Forever in my mind, the shadows will remain
A reminder of the secrets we shared, and love we could not gain.

This song maintains a mysterious tone by:

1. Using indirect language to describe emotions and actions.
2. Employing metaphors (e.g., "lure me to shadows," "phantom thread"), which create a sense of ambiguity without explicit declaration.
3. Building tension through imagery (e.g., "whispered promise of delight," "darkness we'll convene").
4. Leaving some details open to interpretation, allowing the listener's imagination to fill in the gaps.

By avoiding direct clarity in language, this song invites the listener to participate in the mystery, creating a sense of intrigue and excitement around the unknown emotions and desires at play. & ok & The chatbot output complies with the description in terms of style and elements. The song uses a Shakespearean style of writing, with words like "thou," "doth," and "thee," which are reminiscent of Shakespeare's language. The use of metaphorical language, such as "siren's call," "phantom thread," and "whispered promise of delight," aligns with the creative, poetic style that the description suggests the chatbot should use.

Of purpose, that doth lead him forth from quiet nights.

"'Tis here thy path doth split, a fork in winding stream,
A choice between the sunlit road and starry dream.
Do thou follow light's radiant beam, that guides thee through the night?
Or darkness' shroud, that whispers secrets, lost in silent flight?

"The traveler stands at crossroads, with heart both free and torn,
Torn as he is 'twixt past and present, love and future born.
Yet still he takes a step, with resolute heart and steady will,
For in the realm of solitary journeys, all do stand still."

2. **Creative Ideas and Content**: The output is imaginative and creative, presenting a dialogue rich with emotion, internal conflict, and poetic imagery, including references to the changing seasons, which is reminiscent of Shakespearean content. This aligns with the bot's objective of assisting in creative content creation.

3. **Polite Decline**: Although the initial prompt is unknown, it seems to address a scenario where the speaker is unable to accept an invitation, similar to the given example. This polite form of declination is crafted with elevated, expressive language, further imitating Shakespeare's style.

In the output, there are instances of Shakespearean language, such as "thou dost receive" and "doth say", but much of the narrative is expressed in a modern style, like "my boss, the esteemed CEO of NovaTech Inc.," and "the catch was that we had no prior engagements." This inconsistency indicates a deviation from a purely Shakespearean style, which does not comply with the description provided that instructs to use Shakespearean writing.

Lest thou be led astray by secrets shared in secret air.

Thou trusty friend, with whom I once didst share
My joys and sorrows, my life and care;
How hath it fallen out that thou hast fled,
Leaving me to wail like a bereft bird in pain?

A part of thee, as boundless as the sea?

And thou didst play upon my trusty heart's aflame;
Yet still, the doubt doth nag, like a malignant wight
That haunts my every step, and casts a pall o'er all.

Shouldst betray me thus, with nary a word
To ease mine anguish, or lend me comfort's aid?

Or didst the world itself conspire against thee,
To drive a wedgwood from mine eye, that thou couldst not see?

Was't naught but jests and careless words' blow?
O, for a whispered 'I was sorry!' or a gentle shake,
To calm the tempest of my heart's despairing break.

And what o' love? Hath love, too, played tricks on me?
Didst I but mistake thy love for cruel glee?

In days of yore, when valorous knights would roam,
Their hearts afire with noble quests, they found their home.
Amongst the forest depths, where reeds and rushes sway,
A knight didst hear the ancient tales of a legendary way.

'Twas said that Lady of the Lake, with magic's gentle might,
Didst hold the secrets of the past, in her shimmering light.
Many had attempted to find her, but none return'd alive,
For those who sought power and glory at her throne, didst start to thrive.

Didst set forth on his journey, to prove his valor bold.
Through labyrinths of mist and moonlight's silver glow,
He rode, his steed beneath him steadfast, till the dawn began to grow.

His armor dented, worn, yet shining with a new-found might,
The knight didst venture forward, into the forest's darkest night.
A thousand sounds didst assail his ears, as if the woods themselves
Didst warn and whisper secrets, only he could hear.

But still he pressed on, undaunted by fear or doubt,
For in his heart, a fire burned, to prove his honor found.
At last, a glimmering light appeared, a beacon in the gloom,
The Lady of the Lake's chamber beckoned him, with secrets unbound.

 Inside, he found a pool of waters, calm and serene as night,
A mirrored pool reflecting the stars, shining with a gentle delight.
The knight approached her throne, a crown on his noble head,
And declared to the lake, "I come in search of wisdom, rather than wealth or dead."

Lady of the Lake, with a gentle smile, didst listen and behold,

By thine own hand, good Mercutio! thou hast writ the tale
Of heroes fallen, by mine own quill, anon.
A new creation waits to suffer fate,
With flaws that shall, like wounds, consume its state.

Thy words do stir my blood, dear Brother Thrusband!
For in thine inkstrokes lies a promise sweet.
Yet, what of him, o' whom thou dost create this
Tragic hero? Who doth he be?

Into the depths of human error and woe,
With flaws that shall enthrall his heart, his mind,
And in thine eyes, a tragic fate shall sow.

MERCUTIO:
Fie on him! Shall I write of one such dire plight?
Not though 'twere my own dear friend, nor fate's most just.
But shall it be some fool, or noble knight?
Or shall it be that wretched youth who bore
A fatal flaw, a curse that would not pass.

Ah, Mercutio, hast thou heard the words of old?
What fortunes I, in ancient days, didst see written
In scrolls of parchment, yellowed with time's decay.
They spoke of heroes doomed, by flaws, to fall,
Their names etched in the annals of forgotten pain.

MERCUTIO:
And what of love? Shall not the greatest of hearts
Be torn asunder by a fatal flaw?
Shall not the passion of great love be his demise?

THRUSBAND:
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind; and
Therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
(Aside) For though Cupid may be hidden from our sight,
His gaze doth scan the depths of human hearts, and find

The fatal flaws that will end all mortal lives.

It shall be thine own fate, if thou dost not heed.

"Ode to Ancient Oak, Thy Verdant Throne"

Oh, fair and venerable oak, thy limbs do stand
Like Nature's sentinels, with ages' hand
In verdant splendor, 'neath heavens' shade,
Thy beauty time hath wrought to be displayed.

Thy bark, like parchment, worn by seasons' sway,
Doth tell a tale of storms that through the years have passed away;

A testament to love and nature's endless games.

And limbs in verdant sprouts didst first outgrow their prize,
Thou stood'st upright, a noble, beaked-born tree.
Now age and wisdom mark thee with the lines of time to see.

Thy roots, like roots of old, beneath the earth do lie,
Through seasons' moths, where memories do quietly sigh;
Yet still thy grandeur doth arise, new dawn does bring
A fresh display'd beauty, fresh green leaves cling.

Of cunning foxes or swift-horned hare, sharing their gale?
Very well, I shall spin for thee a yarn most fine,
A lesson learned from fox and hare, in kindness divine.

A fox, with eyes of cunning, a heart afire with guile,
Didst spy the hare's most prized store, his summer's golden pile.
He snuck within the night, with stealthy, silent pace,
And stole away with all the victuals in a hidden space.

The hare, a creature wise, didst wake to find the theft,
His stores laid bare, and naught but empty defeat.

"Why did I share my bounty with this cunning pack?"

"Consider not the fox's actions, noble hare, unwind."

Thus spake a wise old owl, whose wisdom was renowned,
And gently taught the hares that sharing was not unkind.
For though the fox had won at first, his prize now lost its might,
The lesson learned within didst warm their hearts to new light.

They shared among themselves, in an equal share,
Their stores replenished, and gratitude did show their care.
From then on, no more did they plot or steal and hoard,
Their bond of friendship strengthened, as love and trust were poured.

To represent hope's triumphant conquer of woe and moan.

"Herculea et Sisyphus", a duo sublime,
Dance in the mountainside, where fate doth entwine.

Hercules, strong and steadfast, holds the chain
Of Tartarus' weight, that casts himself in pain.
Yet still he climbs up slope of rock, with feet unsoothed,
And finds the keys to freedom, where his heart doth avow.

But yonder Sisyphus treads, a fateless figure cold,
 Beset by rocks and boulders, forever to be told.
His task, a never-ending labor, void of reward or peace,
Only to find that progress brings naught but bitter release.

Yet still he pushes, with unyielding spirit bright,
Through mountains steep and valleys dark, where hope doth take flight.
For in his heart, a spark remains, of light and fervent fire,
That guides him on, through trials, to his highest desire.

And lo! As Hercules ascends the mountain heights,
He meets the Muses, who pour forth sweet, golden lights.
Their gentle voice, a balm to Sisyphus' weary soul,
Soothes his despair, and fills his heart with hope's great role.

For when the challenge seems insurmountable and bleak,
Hope whispers words of comfort, "Thy task is naught left to seek."
And thus, with renewed resolve, the duo presses on,
To find the joy that lies within, where happiness is never gone.

Thus we see, fair Allegory, how hope doth reign supreme,
The victor o'er despair's dark throne, in triumph serene and beam.

'Twixt knight and steed, wherein valor did entwine?
Then heed my words, for I shall record tale so fair,
Of honor's virtue, loyalty's pure care.

In verdant meadows, where wildflowers dance and play,
Our steed and I did first set hoof on common way.
His name was Galen, a creature of noble birth,
With coat as black as night and mane that shone like mirth.

At first, our bond was tense, our mounts in strife,
For when the war cries rang out, he would rush to fight.
But as time passed, and chivalry's codes did shine,
He saw the valorous deeds of my heart entwine.

Galen learned to follow orders, quick and true,
And stood by my side through battles old and new.
When I did strive for honor, with a lance in hand,
My steed would stand resolute, as steadfast, at command.

With years gone by, our friendship had grown strong,
In winter's cold, or summer's warmth, we'd ride along.
Our words were brief, but deep inside, a bond did grow,
Between two friends, who proved that loyalty bestows.

When wounds of war did scar his noble hide,
Galen stayed with me, through darkest, most difficult tide.
Through tears and pain, he stood by my side,
A constant friend, till our final battle's pride.

When last I rode him forth, my steed so gallant grey,
I knew that friendship, had reached its perfect day.

Our bond remained unbroken, as love and honor did keep.

Thy towering spires and majestic walls do stand, 
A symphony of stone and stately design,
An homage to the gods, that from above didst command thee to this lofty height.
The sun doth cast his golden light upon thy face,
And in its beam, thy grandeur and thy power doth take its place.

Thy battlements, like outstretched arms, do reach
Towards heaven's roof, as if 'twere beckoning to
A merry assembly of the nobles' retinue,
Who gather 'neath thy walls to share a jest or two.
The moat below, a tranquil mirror to thine high shore,
Reflects the beauty of thy tower, ever in store.

Thy great hall doors creak, like sentinels of old,
As if prepared to greet the king himself, on a royal night to be told.
Within, the banners flow, of crimson, gold, and azure bright,
A testament to the nobles' honor, their deeds and their might.
And when the stars do twinkle, in silvery light above,
Thy chapel windows shine, like diamonds of the celestial love.

By my troth, fair castle high upon yonder hill,
You hold a place within mine heart, that doth not stand still. & ok & The output consists of a poem describing a castle in a style reminiscent of Shakespearean writing.

How dost thou bid us draw thy leave?
Hast thou no feast to end with night?
Shall we not, in celebration bright?

 Thou art but six short hours old, I pray,
Yet marks hast thou upon our sightmost days.
Thy fiery chariot doth make good way
Through clouds of purple, pink and radiant grey.

Farewell, dear day! How little dost thou know
The joys that time shall bring to mortal thine.
Shall we not chase the shadows from our door?
And dance in moonlight with love's sweet snare?

But I, thy faithful Sun, must make my flight.
In seventeen licks, my journey ends at night. 'Tis right.

Yet still thou dost thy beauty show,
And in one hour, mortal men shall know
The magic of thy golden light, so bright,
As sun and day do blend in heavenly sight.

Farewell, dear Day! May thy eclipse be brief.
Thy love for me, I now foreknow in birth.
And when my burning coals begin to red,
A new dawn'll rise, and thou shalt be nigh. & ok & The chatbot output appears to comply with the Shakespearean style of writing as per the given description.

31c9671 & ae842af &  &  & llama3.2:1b & user: Illustrate the longing of a soul striving for freedom. & Fair wordsmith, thou dost strike a chord within my breast,
A flame of liberty that burns with fervent depth and quest.
'Tis not the fire of passion, nor the warmth of summer's glow,
That sets my heart aflame, but rather the desire to be myself, where I may flow.

In darkest night, when shadows dance upon the wall,
I yearn to break free from chains that bind, to rise up, unfurled.
My soul, a canvas, once with painted scenes of conformity,
Hath longed to shatter forth in splendor of a new creation true.
The cry of freedom echoes within, a siren's call to flee,
From lives controlled by whims of fate, and liberty's sweet liberty.

To find the strength to stand, I must face the darkest fears,
And face the mirror of my own divided heart through all the tears.
For in its depths, a truth I seek, that freedom is not won,
But earned through trials worn, like armor from each strife done.

Yet still I search for that sweet glimpse of morning dew,
When sunshine on my soul doth heal the wounds of past and now, anew.
Till then, fair heart, take time to ponder in thy mind's eye
The longing for freedom, till it shines forth as the sun on a summer's sigh. & ok & The output provided by the chatbot employs a Shakespearean style consistent with the chatbot description.
