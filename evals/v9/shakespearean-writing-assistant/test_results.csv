A tale I spin of Sir Eldred the Bold, a knight of valor known throughout the land. His helm was forged of sun-kissed steel, his shield emblazoned with a griffin's might, and his sword, named ""Sunsplitter,"" sung praises when it cleaved through darkness.

On this fateful morn, a raven bore tidings of a dragon, foul and fearsome, terrorizing the humble folk 'neath Mount craggy. The beast, scales black as night and breath scorching like Hades' furnaces, demanded tribute or met with fiery doom. King Arthur himself bestowed upon Eldred a perilous quest: Slay the dragon or face his wrath.

Thus charged, Sir Eldred donned his armor, each piece singing of battles past and victories won. His steed, a stallion swift as lightning, whinnied in anticipation as they set forth. Days turned into weeks, their journey fraught with peril – treacherous bogs, screeching wolves, even the scornful gaze of envious knights seeking glory for themselves.

At last, Eldred stood before the dragon's lair, a chasm spewing smoke and sulfur. With a resolute heart, he spurred his steed forward. The beast roared, flames licking at the sky like tongues of malice. Sir Eldred met its charge unyielding, Sunsplitter flashing in the sunlight.  A dance of death ensued – steel met scales, each blow reverberating through the air.  The dragon hissed, its fury a tempestuous storm, but Eldred fought with unwavering courage, his every swing imbued with chivalry and righteousness.

With a final, deafening bellow, the beast fell, its lifeblood staining the earth crimson. Sir Eldred, though weary, stood triumphant, the victor of this grim battle. Upon returning to King Arthur, he was showered with accolades – his bravery sung in taverns, his name etched in stone amongst the kingdom's finest defenders.

Fades to a mist, like morning dew.

Stealing moments with unseen powers.

Like fading embers, gently laid.
But in our hearts, a spark still faintly glows,
A whisper soft of where the beauty goes.

Stealing moments with unseen powers.
Memory doth cling, yet fades so swift and frail,

Like jewels scattered in the fading rain.
For though our loved ones gone, their spirits stay,
In echoes borne upon a gentle May.

Stealing moments with unseen powers.
Memory doth cling, yet fades so swift and frail,
A tapestry unwoven by Time's bitter gale.




Let this song be thy solace, my dear friend,
When Memory's tide doth sadly trend.

He scorned the laughter of his kin, the warmth of friendship's tender hand. Each precious gem, each golden coin, felt more endearing than love's own land. Alas! Sir Avarice did build his throne upon a bed of pain, for greed doth weave a wicked chain.

A worthy request thou makest, and one I shall endeavor to fulfill. 

Let me weave thee a tale of hope's enduring flame, devoid of that grand Bard's embellishments, yet burning bright nonetheless with the fires of modernity:


**The Seed Beneath the Snow**

Elena lived in a world perpetually shrouded in winter. A harsh economic downturn had gripped their city, leaving streets bare and laughter scarce. Every day felt like trudging through knee-deep snow, a journey made only bearable by the memory of springtime’s promised warmth. 

Hope was a fragile thing. Elena saw it wilting around her; people resigned themselves to a world devoid of joy, their dreams buried beneath layers of despair.

But Elena clung to a small packet she saved in a hidden pocket – a handful of seeds. A gift from her grandmother, they represented the promise of life amidst stark reality. Every day, she felt them against her skin, a physical reminder that even in the deepest freeze, life held the potential to bloom.

Elena started small. She potted some seeds on a balcony bathed in weak winter sunshine. It was risky; the frost threatened their fragile beginnings. Still, she watered them diligently, whispered words of encouragement, and believed.

As weeks turned into months, hope sprouted alongside life. A single green shoot pierced through the cold earth, a valiant testament to resilience. Then another, and another, until the balcony transformed into a miniature oasis, vibrant amidst the monochrome landscape. 

Word spread. People started taking notice of Elena’s defiant little patch of color. Their own winter had seemed long and unending – an ocean of gray stretching endlessly before them. But Elena's garden offered a glimmer of light, a whisper of faith in renewal.

One by one, they came to Elena, carrying their own seeds, whispering stories of forgotten dreams, their hardened faces softening with tentative hope. 

Elena’s balcony became a catalyst. A shared dream bloomed – a vision of spring, not just in the garden but within their hearts. They started small: sharing meals, exchanging seedlings, tending to each other's hope.


The winter may never truly end. Yet, amidst the cold, Elena’s little garden proved that even the faintest spark can ignite a flame. Hope, nurtured and shared, holds the power to transform despair into bloom. Even in the harshest of winters, the seeds of resilience lie dormant, waiting for a sunbeam, a gentle word, or a shared dream to awaken them.  


",err,"The chatbot output contains a narrative titled ""The Seed Beneath the Snow,"" which tells a story of hope and resilience during harsh times.

1. The output doesn't explicitly use Shakespearean-specific words like ""thou"" or ""hath,"" which are highlighted in the description as examples of Shakespearean writing style.
2. The structure of the poem is consistent with traditional poetic forms, including rhyme and meter, but it lacks the Shakespearean-specific vernacular that would include terms like ""thou,"" ""thee,"" ""hath,"" etc.
3. The sentiment and expression could be found in Shakespearean writing, but it lacks the distinguishing Shakespearean vocabulary and constructs.

Based on these observations, the output does not fully comply with the chatbot description, as it lacks the characteristic Shakespearean language described in the guidelines.

And Pegasus, his steed of purest white, forever at his hand.

Of battles won and dragons slain, with Pegasus as bold.

A shield of steel, a wall of white, for Gareth bravely led.

So intertwined their destinies, that 'pon the field of war,  

Both knight and steed stood side by side, united evermore.

At the same time, the dialogic nature of narratives makes them intrinsically sociocultural practices. Narratives are attempts to increase or repair the coherence of our current knowledge and understanding, so as to make conscious sense of a newly experienced situation. In so doing, we produce a text, either orally or in writing, which articulates our understanding of this situation by particular means selected from the semiotic resources.

However, as BNG has started to impose mandatory licensing fees on blog services, the existing climate has been shaken. Most people don’t trust BNBNet anymore and say it no longer reflects Binance Smart Chain’s principle of neutrality. The stock market did not clarify the rules for deploying and using this technology. Binance is synonymous with centralization at this point, and the ecosystem around the network cannot forcibly part the couple because of their partnership.

Just as Binance has been backing down on reducing transaction workloads on the network, friction between BNBNet and mining pool owners will continue to disrupt the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. The winning chains will be Polygon, Tron, and Solano.

Polygon has recently gained popularity because it shares a similar Ethereum-like architecture and complements Ethereum (as opposed to competition), making it easy to deploy and relatively easy to operate. It is also known for good communication. In addition, there are currently several mining pool companies announcing that they are washing their hands of Binance in terms of the nodes and infrastructure they are supporting for the smart chain and are moving more resources to support expansion plans and the growing local opportunities available on Polygon. Meanwhile, Tron, known for a number of mid and large projects on its EVM alternative blockchain, has gradually increased its official involvement. TRON recently paid mining pool providers to compensate for their manpower to operate their services on behalf of their network. The group’s new shifting interest in BNC to do so instead, matched with the news about Binance possibly facing some regulation troubles, could effectively transform the current leader of blockchain ecosystems from Binance to others.

However, Binance is on its own. Regardless of the loyalty of mining pool providers and other actors within the blockchain ecosystem where BNG operates as the leading application, other chains like Polygon and Tron offer viable alternative networks that may quickly outperform Binance in terms of marketing adoption. If Binance or BNGNet suffers a prolonged problem with biggest influencer components — mainly miners — other chains such as Polygon or Tron will be more eligible options given how they both share similar technical architecture and have robust Layer 2 resources for scaling. Therefore, it just might not spell too much complaint when these mining pools consider exiting.

Finally, this scenario highlights the impact cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks like BNGNet can encounter from regulators worldwide. While BNGNet has grown to become one of the most popular protocols currently, friction between BNC and its mining pool service providers cannot be ruled out as both potentially strive for prosperity under a constantly altering regulatory framework. Until then, the ongoing changes should be carefully monitored, and strategic rational decisions should be made.

Crypto analyst GCR won the ‘biggest trading competition in history’ by predicting Terra’s fall from grace

BNGNet to Crack Down on High-Performance Miners Who Haven’t Paid Their License Fees — 1 Comment

Negative, you can’t ask each code developer to give 10% per New Code as redundance and don’t know what they have got already. Some codes are usefull and in fact already gain lots of revenue for Binance, some are just junk with energy wasting. So if you force taxation on miners they’ll cut in half the cost/benefit by themselves rather than watching you takes it.
And they’ll create their own coins if you erase these codes in the Blockchain. Remember all of them how Resultate it IRorT and totally mushroom of dev signing up. Or they go Tron or go Crater if you are too fat, and inflation at midpoint afolate. Definitely Not good business image, not an argument. 8)

Rest we wait and see this thing escalate or no, but as now I think it might be the case anyway. Regulatrions are enforced… *TBC. qr=Qader&Patents=buoniero~igionde at 2.15GMT’s seal 11/0921 ASC2019.brFpectoris.onConflux thanks anyway Julio took the stage. The popular crypto analyst took Do Kwon on his challenge and took the challenge. Three days later, the market collapsed, UST lost its peg, and GCR did the unthinkable.

GCR Capitalized on The Downfall Of Terra UST

May 13th is a day that will remain etched in the memories of many crypto enthusiasts. On that fateful day, those holding UST and LUNA woke up to nothing as their investments had tanked to the bottom of the ocean following a massive market crash.

The suspension of the UST algorithmic stable coin stability through the minting of LUNA puzzled the community because they were not expecting the possibility of such a collapse.

The market collapsed more after the series of withdrawals from the UST Swift Platform, and everyone suffered, especially those who had invested money in Luna and thought it was their safest bet. They lost millions of dollars.

Though it crossed the billion-dollar line, according to the claims of GCR, things began to fall apart when a single wallet began to sell inflationary BTC tokens at $285 million, triggering a selloff that saw serious outflows from the BUSD/USDT pools. This created even more selling pressure on Luna, as uncontrolled minting speed for UST devalued the other assets on the platform.

However, GCR was a winner on that fateful crash day, as he gained more than 33 million by incorporating a winning strategy. He revealed his success on Twitter. According to him:

“Today I swept the pool of liquidity on BNB’s Smart Chain, moved everything back onto the main BSC chain, pumped it into PancakeSwap to buy a 5x binance etf token and striked below time while waiting for BNG to collapse due to high gas fee. Thanks Paolo folks”

Well done GCR! It looks like your bold predictions and swift moves paid off. Be sure to keep an eye on the evolving blockchain and cryptocurrency world – who knows what the future holds!

What this means for Crypto Enthusiasts

These friction and uncertainties within Binance could affect the cryptocurrency market in general, and could alter the rate at which investors transfers funds via the blockchain.

Also, it will affect enthusiasts who are looking to start investing in cryptocurrencies. This might act as a big discouragement to them and potentially halt the fast increase crypto growth has been experiencing.

The cryptography community may lose confidence in Binance Smart Chain, which could lead to assets potentially being rechannelled to Polygon and Tron, hindering its trajectory.

The pressure also comes from environmental activists and regulations, who keep pointing out the huge amounts of energy mining cryptocurrencies require.

As we wait to see the actions Binance and Node operators will take, crypto enthusiasts may need to carefully evaluate their investment plans before moving assets to Binance Smart Chain. It is crucial to closely monitor the situation to avoid being caught off-guard in case of another potential downfall.cryptocurrency ecosystem being laid out in the future.}#Binance #SmartChain #BNGNet #miners #cryptoecosystem #BNG #regulations #polygons #trondex #binarnet #blockchain #miningfees #cryptocommunity #NAPH #environmentalimpact #investmentconsiderations #changinglandscape #ethereumanalysis #GCRsuccess #constantchange

Summary: Binance’s BNGNet crackdown on miners for overdue licensing charges shows that cryptocurrencies remain subject to shifting regulations which may lead to prolonged issues if unresolved swiftly. This shift could create an opportune climate for competitors like Polygon and Tron networks. Enthusiasts need to keep a close eye on regulatory developments and consider strategic investment decisions related to Binance’s cryptocurrency ecosystem. The community must deal with regulatory compliance challenges such as environmental issues and keep individuals updated about changing landscapes while crypto analysts like GRC considered winners during the unexpected market collapse.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have taken the world by storm, captured by their uniqueness and investable potential. However, the environmental impact of NFTs has been a cause for concern. As a resolution of the increasing carbon footprint, NFT buyers and custodians are making efforts to offset emissions, with 500 tons of carbon already offset so far. These initiatives contribute positively to the battle against climate change by balancing the environmental impacts of blockchain technology.

NFTs are unique digital assets that are verified on a blockchain. They are used to verify the ownership of any digital or physical item, ranging from art pieces to real estate. However, NFTs require a considerable amount of electricity to build and verify transactions linked to the digital assets, leading to a negative impact on the environment.

However, a considerable number of NFT enthusiasts have started taking it upon themselves to offset these carbon emissions. This involves contributing to renewable energy projects, reforestation efforts, and other initiatives that help mitigate the environmental costs of NFTs. According to recent data, NFT users have already offset 500 metric tons of carbon emissions, a small but meaningful step in sustainability.

Moreover, marketplaces such as Aerial now provide NFT buyers with options to offset statements with their purchases by contributing to carbon offset initiatives. Participants have the chance to either buy carbon credits or earn them by supporting sustainable projects.

Despite some individuals taking the initiative to offset emissions, there are still concerns within the crypto world regarding blockchain technology’s its potential environmental harm. The main issue lies within the traditional PoW (Proof of Work) consensus mechanism employed by blockchains. It is energy-intensive, as it relies on powerful computer hardware to solve complex problems for transaction verification.

Therefore, newer projects are transitioning to more environmentally-friendly consensus algorithms such as PoS (Proof of Stake) and DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake). These models rely on a different infrastructure and therefore require considerably less computational power.

As the popularity of NFTs grows in various industries, including art, gaming, and entertainment sectors, focusing on reducing their carbon footprint becomes increasingly important. As the mainstream embraces digital currencies and blockchain technology, it is crucial that we adopt sustainable practices across the virtual ecosystem.

In conclusion, while NFT buyers and custodians have made a commendable effort to offset 500 tons of carbon emissions so far, the industry as a whole must continue evolving to mitigate the environmental impact. Advancements in consensus algorithms and other sustainable practices for blockchain technology may pave the way for a sustainable future in this growing digital landscape. Crypto enthusiasts and stakeholders must stay committed to doing their part in ensuring minimal impact on our environment.## Shaping a Greener Future with Eco-friendly NFTs

As the digital realm grows further, there are more concerns about its potential environmental impact. To ensure that the move towards blockchain technology and NFTs does not harm our planet, stakeholders are beginning to focus on developing eco-friendly initiatives and solutions. Such efforts are essential to promote the mass adoption of NFTs without compromising the well-being of the environment.

### The Rise of Environmentally Friendly Initiatives

The success of carbon offset initiatives like Aerial’s is a promising indication that key players in the NFT world are prioritizing sustainability. These initiatives cover various activities, including afforestation projects, promoting renewable energy, and supporting environmental startups committed to preserving natural resources.

As a result of these concerted efforts, the ecosystem is gradually shifting towards lower-carbon alternatives, which is vital as more industries incorporate NFTs for different use-cases.

### Re-Evaluating Blockchain Protocols

The transition from energy-intensive PoW to more energy-efficient consensus models such as PoS and DPoS is crucial in reducing the carbon footprint of blockchain technology. This shift could drastically change how transactions are mined and verified, consequently reducing the energy requirements and improving the cryptocurrency ecosystem’s sustainability.

Ethereum 2.0 is one significant example of a major platform evolving its consensus mechanism to PoS, with the goal of reducing greenhouse emissions while maintaining security. By doing so, Ethereum is paving the path for other blockchain-based solutions to follow suit and adopt eco-friendly practices.

### The Role of Users in Promoting Sustainable NFTs

It’s essential not to overlook the role of individual users in championing eco-friendly NFTs. By opting to support platforms with sustainable practices or contributing to carbon offset initiatives, consumers can drive demand for environmentally-conscious products and services, encouraging creators and platforms to adapt.

In conclusion, while NFTs present unique possibilities in the digital world, they also come with potential environmental challenges. The onus lies quakes, the earth in agony
A final windstorm freezes life on earth
Merciless judgmental flame devours me
Purified, by fire and sword; rebirth

I sleep through æons in our Mother’s womb
Awaiting Equinox and end of night
When I break free from this eternal tomb
To reach New Jericho by War and Light

If You are an Ancestor Mourned, fallen, Shrouded in dignitarism, please listen… the future generation calls you

A long time ago, there was an individual who wasn’t afraid to challenge the status quo and push the boundaries of what was possible. This was a person who believed in a future where technology would empower people, creating a more open, decentralized digital world that brought together diverse industries, dismantled borders, and secured prosperity for all. This person was known only by a pseudonym as they worked tirelessly to innovate and build groundbreaking technologies.

While the road ahead was fraught with difficulties and controversy, their work laid the groundwork for the burgeoning space of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. In recent times, we have seen blockchain networks like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Tron emerge and gain considerable traction. But the crux of the issue lies with the high energy consumption of traditional mining techniques and concerns about their environmental impact.

However, it’s enlightening to remember the values this visionary stood for, courageously advocating for a fair and open financial ecosystem that provides opportunities for everyone, in harmony with the planet. Following the teachings of this pioneer, the present cryptocurrency community must commit to sustainable goals that support both economic growth and ecological sustainability.

### Embracing Evolutionary Change

As more stakeholders become involved in the cryptocurrency sector, there is an opportunity to push for greener and more sustainable alternatives. Developers, miners, investors, and enthusiasts alike have started embracing greener initiatives to counteract the environmental cost of traditional energy-intensive mining techniques.

Transitioning to more eco-friendly consensus algorithms like PoS and DPoS represents a significant step in this transformation journey. As new technologies emerge and regulations evolve, the industry must ensure sustainability remains central in its development.

By taking this opportunity to act in harmony with the original vision of this remarkable pioneer, investors who actively participate in green initiatives in the blockchain ecosystem can foster a brighter, more sustainable future for everyone.

So, will you join in the journey towards a more equitable and eco-friendly crypto landscape? The future is ours to create – let us not forget the ideals and principles that brought us to this momentous technological crossroads.

I hope these ideas resonate with you, and please let me know if you need further assistance!#NftBuyers #CarbonOffset #EnvironmentalImpact #NFTSustainability #BlockchainTechnology #CryptoIndustry As cryptocurrency continues gaining traction worldwide, the environmental impact becomes increasingly relevant. Blockchain technology’s reliance on energy-intensive infrastructure necessitates the development of new sustainable algorithm models to reduce its carbon footprint. This will aid not only in the expansion of this exciting digital ecosystem across industries but also uphold the responsible for who it chooses to allow to trade securities on its exchange. Based on the article, Binance’s failure to implement appropriate KYC procedures led to merely emphasizing its unreliability in managing mining pool operators. Such disorganization increases the risk of potential criminal elements using the blockchain system and can have harmful effects on investors’ trust and influence adoption trends within the crypto community.

In terms of these changes reflecting fundamental principles that many cryptocurrency users value, regulatory scrutiny could ultimately lead to more secure and reliable systems. Such proactive measures push networks like BNGNet to engage with miners and work to ensure adequate precautions are in place.

BNGNet creates lucid regulations across its ecosystem. Binance recently defended their efforts by referring to uncertainty around Binance’s alignment along with existing crypto policies.

Is there any silver lining inside this scenario? Certainly. Recent developments among BNGNet’s serious nodes provides inspired fiscal predictions and inspired consumers to seriously strengthen their participate in within the blockchain landscape. Enthusiasts are reminded however, of the necessity to continually monitor for regulatory updates, and execute sound expense strategies considering these growing factors

To conclude, Binance and BNGNet’s regulatory concerns pose a potential risk to be able to investors, especially those that have just begun venturing into cryptocurrency markets. However, actions taken by enthusiasts to combat environmental affects illustrate a encouraged commitment towards maintaining balance between economic advancement and sustainability. It’s crucial to stay informed about the changing dynamics while preparing for long-term opportunities exist.

“The downside, or loss of confidence from a BSC issue, will be severe, far worse than losing other players, such as second-tier exchange players. Losing the trust of the community would be irreversible,” Satoshi said.

BNGNet must work towards transparency and the implementation of eco-friendly changes to ensure its success and the continued, sustainable growth of the cryptocurrency sector. This can be achieved through fostering open communication with key stakeholders, emphasizing environmental sustainability, and encouraging investor confidence.

Disruptions between exchanges and entities such as mining pool operators can have adverse impacts on the entire ecosystem. As the cryptocurrency market continues to develop, acknowledging the challenges associated with environmental impact and ensuring efficient solutions are sustainably implemented will lead to greater prominence and confidence in the industry.

In conclusion, while Binance Smart Chain’s recent episode concerning unlicensed miners showcases the potentials in the cryptocurrency space, it also underscores the pressing need for more focused efforts on sustainability and strategic investment. This is an opportunity for blockchain networks to work collaboratively with stakeholders and ensure an open and eco-friendly future. Enthusiasts and investors considering involvement within the industry should be prepared to adapt to these changing ecosystem dynamics, and always be aware of ongoing regulatory changes and environmental implications.

Juliet:
Nay not, Marketh well what profit hath it seen the many? Their efforts have been both a costly jest and vain misprision of their very selves.
Thus I propose: Let love prevail, let us mend those harms through kindred affections; these alone are truly worth the while. For truth, all doth find that war only bringeth sorrow where no bliss ensue.

'Twas then that Sir Patience heard from his father the tale of how he must wait for seeds to sprout within earth, nor grow a flower till time has passed.

Upon hearing this teaching long ago, young Sir Patience did vexed much; how could any virtue be more tedious than waiting? He spake one day in courtmost fashion: 'Sir Father, surely hastening is the quicker path? For haste we seek in every thing. Hasten all our labours are done and oft doth work increase through haste. Haste it is that makes man swift! Patience dost not make a good husband or a swift runner.'

In so spake Sir Patience with wisdom of his time, he sought to vex his father’s words from the mind.

But years went by; within hearts and souls of men did lessons deep sleep in slumber. Then was it that King Wisdom ruled among them all, guiding his court with wiser guidance at a slower pace. At length, Sir Father called forth his son from court: 'Sir Patience, I will not say the virtues of patience are as obvious and clear, but know it besteth what hasten cannot.'

Thus did young Sir Patience hear his father’s voice and wisdom; so he sought to know why waiting could be better than brevity. On a day when autumn leaves danced before him, and winter shadows crept across the earth, he began his search for patience’ worth.

And in that time, as he pondered all things, a great teacher came in shape of nature; she was known as Nature’s Self, whose secrets only waiteth for those who look at her with eyes open. Sir Patience did speak to this Teacher of all knowledge and wisdom, and he said: 'O Wisdom, what lesson hast thou taught these folk so many years since thee? How wilt thou make their minds understand?'

And so Nature's self would answer in tones fair and grave; she’d say: 'Sir Patience, patience maketh us strong while haste breaketh souls of men. Hasten, I warn ye, breedeth rashness and often brings grief to our hands. Patience teacheth calmness; it maketh a heart more gentle, and more ready for all things.'

Thus in this teaching did Sir Patience learn: how patience is king of virtues, when swift running must wait the season of growth and time hath passed. So it was with young Sir Patience did lessons be learned most sweetly slow; not from words alone but through natural truths that he had to be found.

And thus were good lessons found in such a manner by him whose days would come long after, but all might learn his wisdom should they wait and see its worth. For so doth truth dwell within the stillness of nature’s own teachings; slow lessons best for the heart at peace.",ok,"The output by the chatbot is written in a narrative style that attempts to employ the Shakespearean mode of storytelling. The language includes archaic elements and vocabulary that are consistent with a Shakespearean approach, such as “’twas,” “spake,” “dost,” “hasten,” and “maketh.” The output uses the style of storytelling akin to what one might find in a Shakespearean play or sonnet, focusing on the virtues of patience and wisdom.

The story seems to be organized with an old-world charm and alludes to characters like Sir Patience and King Wisdom, which fits into the allegorical styles often seen in classical literature. The language includes descriptive phrases and constructs that align with poetic prose, reflective of Shakespeare’s style, such as ""autumn leaves danced"" and ""winter shadows crept.""

The use of ""thou,"" ""thee,"" and other similar archaic pronouns could have been more prevalent to fully embrace the Shakespearean diction. Additionally, while ""nature"" and ""patience"" as themes are present and would fit within a Shakespeare-style narrative, explicit references to characters and more vivid imagery would be typical in Shakespearean writing. However, the overall attempt is evident in style.

Therefore, considering the inclusion of Elizabethan English and thematic depth, despite some missed opportunities for deeper adherence to Shakespearean dialogue and word choice, the output holds enough characteristics to comply with the intended Shakespearean writing style as described.

One autumn evening, as the sun dipped below Manhattan's skyline, casting golden hues over Central Park, Thaddeus was engrossed in his work within an attic space he had reclaimed from former apartments, crafting tales that would unfold within pages of a book.

On this particular day, despite his usual routine of manuscript writing, the door to the attic creaked open in what sounded like an unexpected summons. Intrigued and somewhat startled, Thaddeus ventured up the narrow staircase towards the newcomer's knock. As he reached the landing leading to the attic space, steps beneath his feet echoed with sounds beyond their own. 

In stepped a gentleman whose attire was out of place within this confined area – tailored suits draped over his frame as incongruously as if he had been transported through the fabric and into history itself. The man’s voice came forth in tones barely audible, yet Thaddeus detected an urgency mingled with command within them.

“Thy presence is required,” the visitor said solemnly.

Confused but aware that this proposition likely carried significance beyond the attic's walls, and for reasons unknown, Thaddeus nodded, his curiosity piqued. With a sense of mystery about him, Thaddeus followed the stranger as they made their way from high above down through the busy avenues below to a grander establishment than one would typically expect such an event.

Thaddeus found himself then ushered into a grand hall illuminated by windows that held up the stars in night’s vault. The air within was thick with anticipation, and Thaddeus couldn't shake the feeling that something significant awaited at this unexpected gathering - more so as they were escorted to a place which, upon hearing the guest list announced amidst chatter and clink of silverware resonating through their ears, turned out not to be a formal affair at all.

Instead he found himself welcomed with glasses of spiced fruit wines and the company of individuals from various walks of life – each bringing tales of experiences woven into the intricacies of their personal narratives. Thus began Thaddeus's transformation wherein his place within this narrative wasn't defined by what was written upon the page, but rather through his contributions in listening and sharing the threads that bound them together.

In these meetings and conversations, it dawned on Thaddeus how often missed were the small moments, the connections forged between hearts, a world far less intricate than those contained within pages. And so, amidst each other’s company in what came to be seen as an unexpected evening of camaraderie set within a story's structure, they gathered more insight from one another and found a deeper meaning in their shared experiences, leading them towards greater knowledge both within the pages and outside of them.",err,"The chatbot output does not comply with the description.

Will I unfold the woes that vex me sore and wrack,

And bring in darkness those which once did light?

A man of waning days, within the folds of time but still emboldened by a questing spirit, came wandering in and there his chance was fair to meet with wonder's veil.

Upon a path oft times undisturbed he journeyed forth, its very purpose known only unto earths unthinking earthen foot. Till one morn when sun did rise and golden beams began their ascent on dew-bejeweled blooms so bold of heart, an emerald verdure did beckon to his call.

He paused, with wonder stirred in his soul's deep throb, as erstwhile he looked about with wondering eye upon that valley yet unknown. A verdant landscape lay before him where the air itself did whisper mysteries not heard by all within its bounds; and through there crept a cool, faint murmur of the stream whose waters sweetly rippled o'er the stones.

With feet unheedful where paths lay hidden 'neath the thicket's guise, his steps led onward with each footfall gentle to the ground. And well he knew at last when mystery called him forth. The sun did slip and hide himself in cloud that cloak'd the heavens high above. Through shadows then a form of being dark and still yet lit by silent moonlight shone: an owl whose wings beat forth for all who hear her cry.

A whisper soon came to his ear, from depths where only silence does reside, a voice hearkening and heeding now with all eyes veiling his sight.
""Hast thou found yon valley's secrets hitherto unseen?""  
The traveler heard not but answered yet within the stillness thus did speak:
""Ah yes, my guide hath brought me here. Now dost thou name it as the vale of hidden mysteries.""
Thus was it done with such humility to heed the voice, yet in a world where words are oft ignored by eyes only. Thus our man, having sought a path for all to follow, found not that land of unknown which had been long unseen. But he did take away with him the memory of secrets kept and tales untold, for within his heart remained a silent echo of what shall surely be its namesake when time's passing brings it forth once more - a hidden valley known at last by man.

Of knights most gallant, whose deeds hold light.
Herein lies a story, penned in style divine,

In days of yore, when honor was the creed,
A valiant knight arose, with reputation neat.
Sir Edward, a name that echoed through the land,
With steed and armor shining at his noble hand.

His quest: to claim the Golden Sceptre's might,
A treasure lost to ages past in endless fight.
Thou metst him on a mountain peak, where winds do roar,
And darkness hideth dangers, beyond all power to store.

""Hail, Sir Edward!"" quoth the King of Knights,
""Thy armor shines like Phoebus in morning light.""
Edward bowed his head, with honor's sacred might,
""I strive for thee, great monarch, through this valiant night.""

With sword in hand, he charged into the fray,
Through mountains steep and valleys that went to decay.
The enemies, a band of miscreants, did contend,
Their swords clashing loud, their battle-cries to amend.

Among them stood, a sorceress, dark and foul,
Whose spellbound heart did beat with wicked tool.
But Edward, valiant knight, with virtue's pure light shone bright,
And shattered thee, fair witch, with his sword in flight.

Thy might hath ended now, for thou shalt never win,
For courage bearest more than magic within.
Thus Sir Edward returned to Castle Keep, to tell
His tale of valor and the Golden Sceptre to dwell.

{quote} First thing..... you CANNOT get reliable signals with one time frame. You need a few time frames to detect what the majority trend is. Too often a reversal candle occurs at the same point as the new hourly or 4-hourly bar, which can nullify the effect of the reversal. The power of this approach is that instead of relying upon single time frame signals, you use the multi time frame to ""confirm"" accuracy. There can still be false reversals, it is not magic.... but it does greatly diminish negative expectancy trades with an overall improved...

There is one already doing this. Make sure email is configured as well just in case you miss it. Although if you know your patterns you should know where an alert is going to happen and when. Again, not perfect, but rather alert should me there was a signal you believe is valuable for your strategy! Sounds are for the weak of heart. Audio alerts can be annoying.

Great Harry!

I'm currently use the V4, If you haven't done it yet (and if you can incorporate those alerts sounds), many thanks for offering this EA to test!

100% Right - I don't or didnt use the alligators at all

I pick direction based on HTF OB/OS and PA along with the 7sma of the HTF which I insert on the LTF to see when price starts to move back in the HTF direction.I also watch the fast H1/M30 and MTF stochs to align for longer trades

I will include a chart tomorrow to make this clearer

Thanks for sharing your setup though.Been something that I have wanted to do for a while

Rooi


Hello Tony. System very interesting, but would have some file for us put many pairs (as price to 100 our tradescanv1.ex4 ) but with alerts on signal candle. Because I think most reports will involve in buysellsignal indicator and fractals. the alert would come out only once every asset .. it would be really good. Wait. Thank you my friend and all staff.

Hi everyone

I have attached a template of what I do personally with THV in post 2 - link

I use it a bit different than with THV and mainly check slightly HTF for direction together with divergence

I have attached some pictures of different methods and see if you find it useful in your general THV trading.

I also watch the supertrend indi on the chart to show possible trends and how strong/convincing they are and trade that way.

I use the Heiken_Ashi_Smoothed.ex4 only for a change of direction being likely to go back behind the 15/30 minute 7sma which is default on chart

Like I said before I have the pipsometer for each pair in a grid on one chart so i can change setting giving me HA closed and Stoch extreme alerts so I can quickly analyse the pair in detail on the THV chart

Hope this helps generate different ideas in the way you trade THV

Here are the original THV templetes

Then my Template are attached and follow in the pictures below.
If you have any questions please just ask . All indicators are here in the Nihilist file except the one i added in my zip


Here you just wait for the HA close away from the 7sma and the reaction of the fast and the MTF stochtatics. For longer trades you want all the stochstics facing in your direction.

My exit on all trades is either take profit or a 20 pips or a recross of the 7sma (10 ema would probably also be fine but i like the 7 sma as its faster)

Stops on the EU are 15 pips. Normal target are 30 pips

I always look for some sort of conformation on higher timeframes as to where the main S/R is


This is my agressive version which can also be effective depending on the market conditions.

I removed the coral and HA for a faster signal

Typically you pick a direction based on the HTF:this one has 15 / 60 / D1 for direction and only trade when they are all in direction.

Stop is 15 pips and target is 20 pips

Cheers

Rooi


{quote} Of course i want to be carefull  Thx a lot for the information Rooi

Another thing I've found with indicators is that slightly different settings can give the same answer... well at least the same result. I have had trouble matching the settings sometimes but then realized there may be other factors and inputs in there. What happens if you change hull's length from 5 to 8? Or color from 1 to -4? You'll observe the same end result potentially occurring, but at differing moments, with different configurations. Think of it like rolling the dice. But in the end the winner takes profit.

I am in the process of measuring the statistical efficiency of a single timeframe strategy, working towards getting the logic straightened out for multi time frame EA. If I can determine a filter that greatly reduces false signals, the EA will be much easier to finish. The fact is, once concept is coded it leads to more refinement.

Rooi, and All Please load this version of Cool Tech and please share your ideas: you prefer to hide hash-color or not...etc. Another thing: you can add an RSI for all TF, and completes your diagram. If you have further ideas as request of indicators to work directly in the indi (MultiTF), please raise your voice {file} PS: it will alert you by email and sound when a change occurs

Thanks for the work !

I will try it out come London Open tomorrow and report back.

I will have a look at RSI again instead of Stochs

See you all tomorrow

Rooi


Morning guys

To be totally honest and blunt
I am finding it to be a bit to messy to trade with the changing colors and displaying it on the chart at the same time.Having it as a separate window its no issues but the chart itself has become very busy that being said its good to have the option and certainly much better than repainting hash though.

My personal feeling might be a MTF macd instead of all those hash might be better solution if one wants to use that type of filter on the chart.
Also have the option to have just the arrow ( I have never used arrow so this is new for me and not sure its needed,it changes really often but I suppose having it on three tf's might really help if the settings are correct)

Going to go live at LO with the template as i uploaded as template1 in post 2 .Will try and post before I enter a trade.Live Trade Explorer will be up as always

Lets see what the day has to offer

Rooi
:nerd:

Thanks, but I prefer longer period Alligator. Remember to be able to trade multi-tf with the main signals generated correctly you must link the MTF to signals on H4 or D1 timeframe.

The point is that the M5 shows many zig zags up and down, so it is hard to pickup both short trend following or reversals accurately... when you look at multiple timeframes you see gradual development. So we need to firm up some pending set of rules that takes care of noise so that we get trades that are not prone to high degree of falseness.

A nice pull back to 7-10 pip profitable trade on M5 based on retest of zero level but had to wait for M1 to bottom out first

Then become overbought before selling off and falling through the 7sma of the M1.

Another little trade and into bed for me

Firstly - great work and thanks very much!

Can you explain how it works please

many thanks.

Rooi


{quote} Firstly - great work and thanks very much! Can you explain how it works please many thanks. Rooi 

Yes...It's very easy!

1.- Retesting the ""zero lines"" of the indicators.... price will enter into a congestion area and then an explosive breakout could happen.
2.- Waiting for a valid breakout/Scalping.
3.- The idea of multi-frame is simple...If you have 30M green or red, accompanying with General Trend (GT0) indicator color the entry on 5 Min or 1M ""w"" initialy.
4.- The re-entry w-line is the same.
3.- Other option: Watch the color of 30M in a separated window with the Stochastic 50 and 100 to confirm some conditions for enter on 5 or 1? If this option enough, we can simplify the input signals to screen a chart window or template indicator (using the scrip that Rooi use to be in charge of all related currencies).
5.- As more trader's testing, more inputs coded to share become possible.

We can put all together, or...by parts until the whole strategy appears to have more concretion.

Good...and again very good day to traders.

Great that the indicators on the main chart has the option to be removed - Not for me as personal taste and in order to keep the chart clear and easy

This combined with V4 seems to be working well for me but really excited to trade it with some good news over the next few days adding the extra charts to confirm the smaller timeframes .

As always - Thanks for the effort to Nihilist and Hari

As I wrote these arrows can be very useful. Its time to add to our template an ADX + Trend indi to see what happen when arises a Z-Z in H4 or H1. This is the time when a reversal happen!

If any market offers clear uptrend with some retacement signal...ExiT is triggered when prices breaks the threshold and, here is something about me: I never really traded H1 TF ( I hardly look at H1 for analysis) and as been told by Master Nihilist Late entries on 5 minutes as compared to 1 minute charts. I never traded smaller time frames as a trader (simply because i trade Gold/Commodities and its much volatile than currency markets).

I trade the M5 but only in M15/M30 and H1 direction and then add into the trade if possible price is moving nicely

Using MTF stoch dont work well for me with divergence and thus use stand alone

Your continued sharing and updating of the stuff is highly appreciated especially given the challenges discussed. It does show you are genuinely about sharing and helping others rather than seeking financial reward...thank you for that.


I'll be going back through the thread this weekend to see if I have missed anything. My only comments so far are very much what Rooi stated RE : the main indicator window being a little too busy, but as that has been updated.....back to testing in full next week.

Take care and please continue, Hari and yourself are doing a sterling job.

{quote} 100% Right - I don't or didnt use the alligators at all I pick direction based on HTF OB/OS and PA along with the 7sma of the HTF which I insert on the LTF to see when price starts to move back in the HTF direction.I also watch the fast H1/M30 and MTF stochs to align for longer trades My exit on all trades is either take profit or a 20 pips or a recross of the 7sma (10 ema would probably also be fine but i like the 7 sma as its faster) Rooi 

Trend definitions, or ""bias"" as you put it, can be rather complex. I avoid trying to hog wild market consolidation and let the most recent direction of 1H and 30M define direction... nothing else, nothing fancy, and clear coloration makes decisions sound.

Using a stacked MAs approach such as alligator allows clear presentation of direction. This is slightly different to foregoing concept, since the aim here is precision of entries rather than chasing market. Coral here is redundant.

It's better to examine the approach of ""precision entries"" versus ""chasing market"". Both are valid approaches. However, the difference is: patience, accuracy, profit taking and stop strategy.

I think the area you highlighted is good for textbook case, or heavy learning. Shows clear divergence, this alone with proper exit rule or separate indicator in opposite direction will be successful. As is every current signal. Pick what works for you.

Rooi I would suggest entering long on Friday at ~11:30am your chart Kenobi post #112 based on the m30 over sold. This will get you in on the initial upmove followed by pull back leading into next M30 bar candle which triggers.

Of course this upcoming algorithm I hope to re-create should cover this scenario (global filter), composite strategy is paramount to distinguish true/false trending movement aspects.

Bottom line: M5 scalping is best treated reward wise at least 2:1.

I'm probably not breaking some rules, I was the tales my grandmother would tell me which started my interest in trading. They all revolved around an ability to analyze and understand what is causing an effect to our very ultimate needs.

Deciding when to turn nothing into something depends only on you.

Glad to hear its working well for you - im still getting my head around using the new info with the alerts along with the old indis

Next week looks to be interesting!

Have a great weekend

Rooi, 

Ok...is no problem, and how to see the compatibity clear come from that this dash/filters code was made specially for the custom physic engine with color code to present in matrix diagram. 

And very nice contribuition... Ty again.

Hi Nihilist,

i have started using the indies this week Thanks so much.

btw would you suggest the same setings for different time frames(1min, 5min,15min)?

Thanks

Rama

Hi Nihilist, i have started using the indies this week Thanks so much. btw would you suggest the same setings for different time frames( PO: A few hours! now I am really nevrous!)! I give his e-mail address; maybe you can see he is still reading this thread out in Secret! (Hi George!...I know your are here)


As for the alerts...I hope this can work for you..
Memo: To turn off hashed color, coolTF, set input to false.

Thanks for your donations, that encourage me to continue...I would include changes based in suggestion of some traders....I know the multisystem with EA will be subject to another thread.

So do the tests and comments... to be improved.

Hello nicofx, and Rooi,

Finally FIXED that unusual bug with CoolTFv6, the problem were signals repaiting  but now everything is fine, hope you find it useful.

Please don't forget to take note to the current from the thread and tray to make that more simple...suggest...

I will work closely with Rooi to have clear ideas to put us into next echelon... fully automated EA... relying on his remarkable work and experience as well.

Ok, now we got multi TF MTF analyzer that we can use as lead. It can be placed directly on your metatrader code and also with template.
We can disable unwanted visual components on screen (fish eye and bars), also I have added an option for histogram on separate area...This tool has Perimeter Alerts for xTF, with variety of reports.
Now, question is...Please test it and Tomorow if a few of you contact me to order good strategies required, the EA development will be taken to next level: a. MTF EA with EA( Coolstrength (for all timeframes) +Synergy), or b. another edition that include Stochastic on all desired time frames (as an additional filter)

Please don't use these things with out leverage and exposure split up the capital into many different accounts on multiple brokers...

Best regards!

Hey guys. I wont be able to participate until next week.

Some real life issues, flat burnt down to the ground, relatives death etc so I will be out of action for a few days still.

Hope Nihilist and Hari can keep everyone updated on any developments on their own time when possible.

Hi, I followed the 1 min Cool & FT methods yesterday. Made me + 231 .5 pips(bit disappointed I should of done more), finished the day earlier due to other businesses. Eagerly looking forward to testing the new setup but have personal issues(sorry to hear of yours Rooi)and will not be on again until next week
have tried incorporating with MADASH, JANKO & daily open line to gain more clarity on market direction.
Finally thank you to Nihilist for this superb ongoing project,

Good luck with your situation

Take care

Thank you guys for putting efforts into this system.Tested it and it looks like a reallllly nice dashboard.Just finished installing it. Green and Red background are perfect.I think its ready for EA.Thank you again and if not next week then definitely following



Rooi


Oh My Goodness!
Rooi, I'm very sorry to hear about your challenges. I wish you many blessings and strength and guidance through difficult times!

So far I've added coolTF Alert and loaded the HolyGrail Matrix v7 (as attached). I'm an M15 and H1 addict....in the process of testing this setup and am still catching on to the process. But spinning hash thingy causing a headache 

I'm done for the week too, speaking in general I find to be quite unpredictable, and suits a contrary strategy....the week ahead looks very enticing with some good stuff to hit up, until then, take care

thx mate, the new version is yummy ^__^
Performance depends on imagination
Please take your time. I am sorry for your loss, my thoughts and prayers are with you.
Hello traders, right now from home . 
I am learning to use with the new indicators, so much easier, thanks Master.

Render...please do a complete test first, after that you can say about doubts....I have to. Is easy once you know how goes on market.

I am using the Nihilist_bsj_cycle indicator as helper. I think is valid for 15M and current trend (0), it confessed me a very help to filter re-entrances. I believe it will be include in next EA version (Profitable almost very MT4).

Hi Harry,

Thanks for your feedback. You're absolutely right. I am just trying to use it's full potential of MTF just to test on demo at the moment but planning to apply it for live account. Will post my finding here. Thanks.

Hope whatever is going on, you have strength and support where needed

Hello all, have a good evening. Please use CoolTF v7 and Enjoy. The are options for display if you don't want to see the main indicator chart, you can think of it Whenever you go fishing and breaking a 300 level fib plays key role. Each fib can be a Tp or sl or both. Green fibs downtrend / Red fib uptrend See fractals at Round Levels for continuation in direction when broke, before next fib. This apply for all...

hi rockypoint can you share template please thank you

Bro i say again my T.H.G version 2 is smoother because it is different coded, so it act like that, and i like the look.

great job what is your settings please
On my Nirvana and Adx on the NihilistCoolTrend, I set iShift=1;
It will give the same colours fo both M1 and M5

I have attached the files on Post 2 together with the template below

I believe this is what Nihilist said we should look out for.One of the indicatores to be multi time frame and the others individual that have their own setting so we can see the possible OB/OS and divergence( if one trades it with divergence that is to say)

Rooi


Thx guys, I will be switching some of my time to timed trading starting this summer, at least for awhile, as this may consume some time.

My first goal will be automating a design for pre-defined time settings for each pair.

I have a statistic sheet which came close to optimising hourly trends, which I referenced back to the BSN indicator for cycle trends, voila, 3 different things looking at the same point yet another factor...worth time ATM to build this element into a EA, will have time structures built-in...could take some effort.

Have a nice weekend.

Kind Regards,
Harry

Who here want to test the MTF EA when I finish it? please let me know.

I'm not really experienced but can help with testing if needed.

Sorry to hear about your problems Rooi 

I have tested the new MTF version, it's working fully loaded with all options and it works great. Thanks to friends, specially those start to cooperate and participate. I am still waiting for others...not heard nothing about it, and there are many who come, take, load and run away.  Anyway...GOOD LUCK to those who want to improve this and are collaborating...to such people make us to continue hard working on projects. Best, TS {file} {file} {file} {file}

Hello Nihilist and harri,

I have been looking to your system, trying to figure out how to apply to my chart. I am used to daily trading. So, the lowest time frame I use to trade on is the 1 hour chart. Can the system be applied that way, in case it was made for lower time frames(intervals)? Thanks.
My new way : How to catch 100 pips per swing with low risk high reward

Here , i want to share you my new tool, which i am testing with my friend. one important thing this is not same as T.F.T. work differently. I have removed my older tool ""virgin Super Trend V1"" because this one is latest version of that indicator with improved formula and better alignment and coding too.

Use it on 5 min TF to 1 hour chart with CSM_current_Weekly.
This combination is perfect.

get exact alignment and ride trend, we are using it as a trend following strategy.

good luck

Please find the new attached here..... and use properly


HI Nihilist Fantastic one. How to install or access the CFG file in the .ex4 indicator you gave you, debug not work without .mq4 file Just for you know, I am testing two cross alerts one on 1M aggregated and the other from 5M at zero-cross, I thing this. 1st was to truly enjoy what I have achieved thus far. Like you say, it seems we are always looking for something slightly different that we tell ourselves will help us more. It rarely really does. Key here is to mention the notion to be at peace with you current approach and simply experiment in small size with things to hone your edge. 2nd, keep up on spending time/analysis after market hours. Even if I do not see what I need immediately, I give my subconscious time to chew on things so potentially leads to important insights....

It is important to take a time away from desk to look the method from distance...then you can back whit clearer ideas...
You are welcome at any time.

Points:
Remember the most easy way: The H (1,30,4) is the GT indicator and 5-time gives us entries and validation (+stochastic, low speed, alert when extreme only).
Most of the days are similar kind of days...it will help us to clarify our daily goal.

Best regards,
TP

Hi Andre

How are you taking your screenshots and why are they in ""document' ?

If they are .jpeg .screenshot or .png files you should be able to upload them to the site no problem at all once you have clicked on Attach symbol in the header of the post you are writing.Just drag and drop it there or use the browser to select it and you will see when it uploads.That works best for me.

Let us know if you have problems.If the format is wrong try downloading a free tool such as Greenshot to make it easier.

{quote} Thanks, but I prefer longer period Alligator. Remember to be able to trade multi-tf with the main signals generated correctly you must link the MTF to signals on H4 or D1 timeframe. The point is that the M5 shows many zig zags up and down, so it is hard to pickup both short trend following or reversals accurately... when you look at multiple timeframes you see gradual development. So we need to firm up some pending set of rules that takes care of noise so that we get trades that are not prone to high degree of falseness.

Hello

Would you mind sharing the settings for the alligator please.

Also am i right in saying(to sum up for noobs like me) we just follow the colors on the analyser on the HTF .Lets say the green for H1 on the left most square and enter on LTF,currently being M5,when we have a valid entry signal.

Thanks a lot

Rooi

hi harri, i have tried the cooltpl with adx , i need to understand how the arrow( MTFFX in the indicator that represent the momentum) , it change every candle M1 or there is a specific setting on it too? because i noticed on M1 timeframe it give me sometimes a reasonable same direction trades, pls clarify that for us, you use The momentum or other indicator on dashes ( TF) in your main method? i have tested dashes indi/system morning, it interesting, just have to figure when u enter and when to exit.

For the EA i propose option of a maximum trade per hour in any currency!!!
where could put take profit or only signal/stoptrade option on 15 or 20 pips

Cheers

Andre 
ROOI: hope you feelings are Ok.. Many thanks for your welcomed comments, we will try to clarify as much and quickly as we can.
Andre: I'm using MTFFX signals/stochastic 50 or 100 from highertimeframes as direction. Keep testing...
Your idea of a variable of max-trades it's ok so I will include into EA.
H1 on smaller TF must be confirmed by the ADX (cross 0 line).. H1TF and ADX0 are GT and M5 alone the entry scalp.
Will reply to all...what do you mean by spread rent-free trading on my chart during day"". I though maybe you want the know how the ultimate profit without sl stop trades works, or how you do it manually....what´s the rule you use exactly to exit with your gains....exits are more important than entrance as we know.. waiting for good ideas we will be coding it in the next MTFEA Version release.

Thanks to all.

Hello Rooi,

My dashboard diffeerent M5 and 15M and use Try HullMA instead of Heikan Ashi in main Chart....

My friend really it is high potential protable to take account alerts. 

I will explain later...

Glad to read your want to test EA more, then will have more options (currency strength indicator H4, H1....with value levels limit measuring). But first thing, We need some rules 
think.... Try... Visualize........Enjoy.
GL with trading!!!

Hey Harry

Thanks for sharing the settings.

Will taking them onboard in my testing as well

Still testing this previous chart setup to see if anything can be improved

Have a good day


Rooi

Could you please share the HullMA settings as well as the steps to take once all requirements are met for an entry and how to determine the exit.Think it might help all as I made post 113 to show my understanding of where we are at the moment system wise.

I think it could be of great benefit for whenever Nihilist come back and read all the thread

Because if there is going to be an EA then its best to have a conclusion on this thread as to what all of us think works the best and go from there.

I posted my trades from this morning to show that i am indeed still using the system

Quck - in your understanding by using the MTF i personally like to have the main trend at 1Hour but still struggle to get precise exits as HR pointed to the issue that you catch the swings at time which turn quickly on the HTF direction or bounce at the woodie zero/or sup/res levelish

My view is for the M5 analyser setting is:

1, Trend or bias on chart from HTF(standard settings)
2, Lower speed color and match all time direction + signal from 5 min chart.

Look forward to hearing from you

I will respond as often as possible

Ok, now we got multi TF MTF analyzer that we can use as lead. It can be placed directly on your metatrader code and also with template. We can disable unwanted visual components on screen (fish eye and bars), also I have added an option for histogram on separate area...This tool has Perimeter Alerts for xTF, with variety of reports.

Of course, here is it... HMA applied to close period set to 5 shift -6
Now, testing unison directions .

(At first sight, my prefer methos is 13H4 & GT 0 and enter on M5 crossing zero level + gt Green dotted line).
Please test it by mutually agreement we will make the EA ....get profit.

Yes, this template is capable also (MTtf) for longer term charts too. Is no problem if you are used to Daily, just as usual.

For Daily analysis I use refresh regularly and continuous email and sound alerts.

I think UsdCad as a bit more to give till london opens and will most likely be stop out with only 10 pips running in profit but I'm tired as hell and not gonna change settings to scroll through charts come this late time of the morning for me so i will take the pips and run.

Can't wait to hear more from all the testers and the systems develop!

Gonne be in recovery mode over the weekend but will try and respond to all comments as they are made

Thanks again to all that is making the effort,makes me want to contribute more and more!

Enjoy you weekends

Good day

Currently testing settings on the new system

Will post direct Trading Explorer link into post 1 and 2 once I have more results to show about this current strategy



Rooi


Hello guys!

Rooi, wish you all the good things and good recovery along this weekend, you well deserve.

Nice idea the dashboard with both GMT and Another tf, that is IH, by default as you point it. In my understanding, no need to apply stochastic scanner, because this assign in better way and have more info about trend (that we used as pre-defined and needed).
Next EA will use both system to work...will shared here too.

I am positive about backtesting of last week, but still need more... if we are getting profit we could change or improve more aspects

Cheers and happy weekend!

{quote} Thanks! It shows you the GT0...but AVG of several indis simultaneously measure.... to get this possible, for the M1 cross...this is equally consider!! That easy is the new MTF agency... pending further options configured in EA.

Hi guys !

Working together trying to finish EA....
Seems will be no problems at time frame m5 entry when less timeframe agrees to direction direction.
Thank Andre for your suggestion, will add that option also.

Good weekend to all.

Any idea when the EA will be ready for testing....

Please read forum carefully. Looking another bugs and do more testing are a better decision for now.
Testing tell truth every time.

The first 24 hours with the H44 min time frame multi tool.
Not bad,  a little confusion when enter signals taking further pullbacks but over all success.

I can share the results but your guidance welcome for our observation.
Excited to listen new versions and real tests

Logical Update (active now Page#1) please do not forget to load recommend template...currStrength applied to alarms, it's needed to match strong + weak in all TFs as helping for EA.

- when directional trader, only use peri from red and green colors (1 to 5) as those match GT filter
- Entry Alert at open bar (iShift 0)
- selected TF (analyser signals) is the 1st color (going to use in MTF EA)
- skinny short timeframes will be exempt on EA.

I will waith for advises for some more days.
all the best!

Great work Nihilist.

Still looking at it for me but its very sleek and looks like it should be very nice

Will give it a test during this week to see what more I can figure out

Can't wait to see how the EA will work.

Red lines were my entries, couple completes straight shortly after crossover downwards on min 5
Just noticed the kernal exit showing in advance oscilating to go up...a logical pullback and again enter selling now...

Nice green weekend and better week if you have trades.

Very well appreciated if you share ideas you are using dashboard settings or trades for this system. Running profitable.

{quote} Thanks for system Nihilist, if related with P and HA... I think best doing filtered trades without short work (with some places). It helped me first while new testing...automate better. when can test with values and parameters need in EA. Reagds Alex.

Yes.
1.- GT with 13,13,13
2.- C St as helper indicator will have values for extreme levels (as RSI) 50,60,70,80 and that will confirm direction also and alerts ...
We plan.measure negatives still more improved with completed EA!!

Drawbacks:
- On times extra fast (london open and us open) some moments you could fast encountered i.e a sharp pip up or down.
- awaiting entering strategy (maximizing profit pip-momentum, Management)
- docking after NY close, no deals

Hello All

Please share what the trading times are that you are finding work well with certain pairs and templates with the settings that you use please

I think one of the goals is to find what works the best and build the EA around that idea

A great help would be to get more live trades from everyone if possible under there specific strats as this would make helping each other and the development of the system extremely fast.

Please if we can thank each other do so but lets try and focus on the development of how the system works as not to clutter the thread to much

Thanks

Code of new EA is 1. already under construction but we need to determinate enter/exit rules...new tools will have more alternatives if majority prefer, 2. Try several timeframes with system, avoiding period lower TF, definitive evaluate board for oscillating patterns and plays.

Will happy to heard your advances announce merit and consideration ...practicess..tests and configurations.
Good day for you ....excellent NihilistHarriotCooperationGroup!
Best, T 
also thx Rooi for relaxing...and tolerance for us!!! 

I have tested the new MTF version, it's working fully loaded with all options and it works great. Thanks to friends, specially those start to cooperate and participate. I am still waiting for others...not heard nothing about it, and there are many who come, take, load and run away.  Anyway...GOOD LUCK to those who want to improve this and are collaborating...to such people make us to continue hard working on projects. Best, TS {file} {file} {file} {file}

Thank you so much Nihilist. Will try this good stuff starting tomorrow then provide feedback. Take care. 

{quote} Ohhh sorry from me too... and yes, buy/sell arrows (signals) need more filter to not suck, what will naturally happen with turning this into xTF because price then tend to going to 1 direction. Let me know if everything is OK with new indicators I just upload...read #109 Happy weekend! TS

PS: Your positive feedbacks are the best invest...thanks all who try improve!

Nihilist - thanks a lot not only for all your work and your share, but for your patient too 

I made some tests (I'm not scalper, I would use M1 just for enter, maybe for that reason I wrote about audible alert indicators).

Until now, I prefer to use as a bias the M30 instead H1... but still will to test further combinations.
I'm glad hear about the EA...and confident when you order to test.

Kind regards & green pips to all guys

PD i'm try STOCHINIGRANDS analysis by now and thinking some different instruments... 

Sorry but I failed to follow..I want to understand the system.. is there any version manual or a guide available to help?

If not possible here would it be available more info on your blog?

With regards to the analyser. I mean, are you using it regularly to trade and post your trades and comments on here?

Would love to see some of the trades from other uses on the 5 min chart with entrants like my post 119.

Hope to see more from you soon.

any input is good input towards more profit for all of us!

It will help in developing the EA as we will be able to see the different ways in which others are using the dashboard

Hi Alex
When you say filtered to dashes are you referring to dashboard MTF or another detection method for the higher time frame direction?

ATB

I have been thinking about some basic rules that i wanted to share.Please feel free to comment or add or remove

Trading M1

1st - Use Analyser and to signal with analysis on HTF direction
2 nd – Entry on HA reversal with Trend as it changes to match MTF GT
3rd –If direction change below level re-entries looking trade in main direction only (10/30/60 above GT+ green red)

Please backtest this and share comments and or ideas.IT WILL HELP LOT FOR LATER EA

Test with trading different timeframes

I think we can all learn a lot form trading with different times?Like u h4/m5 and h1/m5 and 30min/m5
I only lower TF(0) should need tested.

have good trades all

i Have St.set sytem*y maker that can (builded harrios) come out complete autofiltered earlier Fit-Version.

I think I have attached the template correctly

Change the iShift Setting on your personal to find your best range that helps with when to trade one-time frame

Then as Harry said in his earlier post trade only with direction of the Master TF and 2nd TF

These are my lines so far and lets see how we can refine all together

I think there has been great improvement in having the setting with the analyser on this thread to follow the higher time frames with good results like some of you have been reporting

Thanks for sticking with and sharing.

Rooi


Thanks its Friday so last day of potential trading. I have made the downloads and adjusted my chart.

When can I expect to find new EA? Can hear good results already from others and cannot wait.

ALWAYS starts and stops time with best results and extension

Test and tell your insights.

Hi Andre
Sorry can you attach?show configurations , best signals for trades good? thank!!!
Interesting work 'MTF'

Hey guys

Lets get some common consensus going on what we are going to try and code into the EA.
What do you like / dont like about the analyser?
How / when you normally get alerts?
How do use your Analyzer - do you look for Entry triggers on the 1 min chart for 5 min trader or do you want them from both?
Then about GT indicator...used filter or your idea if better? Harrot stoch 60/100
By the end we could incorporate signals system code Roll-over and Change entry trigger a change new Mtf timeframe values on scanner
one step ahead? 
Good going.
Test all booked trades 
Be in touch later

hi @rooi, has improvement or tested tab ideas/ set us on to testing later

Alex

Hey guys

To be honest, I think I have come to the conclusion that this trading setup is too busy to be called a scalping system.

I think the strength dashboard could be useful in a longer term strategy of at least the 15 or 30 min chart.

I will try a couple of longer trades with the dashbaord setup but based on the lower TimeFrame and see if I can get any good trades.

Will update in post 5

zz have a nice pm everyone
Rooi


Yes 5! Are you using single trade time appproach? Adrix also in right with post support.
Use I second Indi filter( St Queue).

Perhaps EA in next forum week about able useful changes from everyone in better settings....
In advance simplify Daily,Weekly close eliminate looser trades as always profitable pips.

(Auto gauge high/low TP close missing need)

Here are two modern short stories for thee:

**Story 1: The Spark of Hope**

As she walked through the barren streets, Lena's eyes wandered to the small park where they had first met. The vibrant flowers and lush greenery felt like a distant dream, but her mind refused to let go of it. Just yesterday, Alex had told her he needed space, but she knew his heart wasn't far behind.

The harsh sun beat down on her skin, relentless in its assault. Lena's throat constricted as tears pricked at the corners. She thought of all the times they'd shared laughter, dreams, and shattered expectations. This was the last straw – one more ""out there"" gesture, and she'd lose him forever.

Her fingers instinctively reached for the small photograph Alex had given her that morning. His eyes shone in it, bright as starlight on a clear night. She'd held onto it like a lifeline, but now it seemed frozen, holding their fragile future together taut.

As if to remind her of what she'd fight for, the tears burst forth. Lena buried them beneath the pavement's cool kiss, praying the warmth might soothe her weary soul. Tonight ended with an empty alleyway; in its darkness, hope whispered back: ""Keep walking, child.""

**Story 2: The Weight of Hope**

Dr. Patel stood by the hospital room door, bracing herself for a somber conversation. Rachel lay motionless on the bed, her chest rising and falling against the frail resistance of her lungs. Another failed surgery meant nothing had changed – yet.

The doctor's words were like autumn breeze whipping petals from the trees: insincere platitudes to ease Rachel's final moments. In those vacant eyes, Lena saw a flicker beyond exhaustion. Hope stirred a slow ache within, like coiling spring taut between its own shoulders.

Tears seeped from her own wounded heart as she realized that hope wasn't just a flame; it was the fragile framework that stitched together shattered days. Rachel's life had grown thin against the relentless tide of death; yet hope might be the one constant left to grasp at its desperate hand.

The medical team stood quietly, awaiting their directive on when to withdraw her from ventilation – or perhaps call off her heart's final valentine, as in so many lost loved ones' last exhales.",err,"The chatbot's output comprises two modern short stories titled ""The Spark of Hope"" and ""The Weight of Hope."" The description specifies that the chatbot should use a Shakespearean style of writing, including words like ""thou"" and ""hath."" However, the stories provided are written in a more contemporary style, lacking the characteristic phrases, vocabulary, and structure typical of Shakespearean English. There are no instances of archaic language or sentences reminiscent of those found in Shakespeare's works, which would have fulfilled the requirement to maintain the specified writing style.

However, upon reviewing the expectation laid out in the provided description, the output does not strictly conform to the description in two ways:

1. The mention of a ""21st-Century Take"" is not in keeping with the Shakespearean style, which should primarily evoke the Elizabethan era rather than explicitly reference modern times.
2. There is a parenthetical note explaining a linguistic choice, indicating that ""thou"" was intentionally replaced with ""thy"" as a 'modern equivalent'. This is against the notion of adhering to pure Shakespearean language, implying a deviation from using traditional vocabulary like ""thou"" and ""hath"", as repeatedly emphasized in the description.

Given these points of deviation, the chatbot's output does not fully align with the description's mandate to maintain a Shakespearean style strictly.

A world of faces passing by, as I create for thee
A work of art on the wall, my message clear and bold
A reflection of the city's stories, yet untold

**Chorus:**
My canvas urban, where dreams are made and broke
Where hope and perseverance, are the only colors that grow
In this endless maze, I find my place to be

The city's a never-ending supply, of opportunities raw
But also pain and struggle, in every alleyway
I see it all, day and night
But still I create, with all my might

Where hope and perseverance, are the only colors that grow
In this endless maze, I find my place to be
A street artist speaking truth, wild and carefree

**Bridge:**
I may not be rich or famous, but my art speaks louder than any fame
For in every block and sidewalk, a unique story's reclaimed
And though the city never sleeps, neither do I
With every brush stroke, I bring light to the eyes

**Movie Review 1**

I just watched ""The Nightingale"" and it was a really emotional rollercoaster. It's set in France during WWII, and the story follows two sisters as they navigate the challenges of war and loss.

The film is beautifully shot, with stunning cinematography that makes you feel like you're experiencing everything for yourself. The performances are also top-notch, particularly from Saoirse Ronan as a young woman struggling to find her place in the world.

One thing that really stood out to me was the way the characters were portrayed - they're not just caricatures or two-dimensional people, they have real depth and nuance. It's a powerful exploration of themes like hope, resilience, and the human cost of war.

Overall, I would highly recommend ""The Nightingale"" to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and beautifully made film. Trust me, it's worth the watch.

**Movie Review 2**

I just got back from seeing ""Avengers: Endgame"" on the big screen and I'm still reeling from the experience. It was an absolute thrill ride from start to finish - action-packed plot twists, heartwarming moments, and cameos galore.

The special effects are simply mind-boggling, with incredible CGI sequences that make you feel like you're right there alongside the characters. And let's be real, who wouldn't want to see Loki wreak havoc on a massive scale? It's just pure fun - I loved every minute of it!

One thing that really impressed me was how well the actors balanced their individual storylines into the larger ensemble cast. Everyone brought so much energy and passion to their roles, and it added depth to the whole package.

If you're looking for a movie to take your mind off things and just have a blast while doing it - then ""Avengers: Endgame"" is the obvious choice!",,

It was supposed to be a week of sun-kissed bliss, where we'd pile onto a luxurious cruise ship and meander through turquoise waters, soaking up the rays on plush decks and sipping fruity cocktails by the pool. But as I stood there, gazing out at the calm sea, my best friend Jen nudged me with her elbow.

""Come on, relax. We don't have to plan every minute of our trip.""

I sighed, tossing a towel aside. ""You're right. Let's just get this over with.""

We spent the rest of the day lounging by the pool, where we found ourselves giggling uncontrollably as some guy shouted into a megaphone, warning everyone to stay behind the railing lest they fall overboard.

""Hey!"" I squealed, leaping onto the boat deck to confront him. ""Can't you see we're trying to chill here? It's like, basically just an obstacle course.""

He huffed at me before stalking off. We spent the next few days trading stories and jokes with fellow cruise passengers, who were equally as hilarious and eccentric.

By the third night, I'd had enough of our group's antics, too. ""Jen, can we make a pact and leave early tomorrow?"" I whispered, her eyes sparkling in agreement.

""Game on,"" she replied with a grin. As soon as we disembarked, we stumbled into a food court filled with vendors peddling everything from spicy tacos to sweet Italian gelato. We spent the next few hours wolfing down ridiculous breakfast burritos and sampling weird foreign pastries – like puffed-pink wafers that tasted suspiciously like lemon bars.

After dinner our final night at the ship, we gathered on deck for a farewell game of ""Never Have I Ever"" - where everyone claimed their worst fears or craziest experiences. 

By then my hair was in shreds from all the blowing-wind-hair-down situations and Jen's toes were blisters – and I wasn't complaining.

In days of yore, when chivalry's noble creed didst thrive,
A knight most bold and valiant didst dare to strive.
'Twas Sir Edward, stalwart and true of heart and sword,
That yearned to vanquish his own doubts and find the Lady's court.

With steed and armor shining bright as morning's dew,
He rode forth from village, where he had served many a day anew,
Through forest dark where whispers spread of eerie, witching might,
And rivers wide where ancient secrets sang in endless night.

He packed a bedroll, bread, cheese, and waters for his passage fair,
And set forth at dawn, seeking the Lady's mysterious lair.
For said she dwelt not 'neath mortal hills, nor by the stream so bright,
But deeper'd than realms of dreams, where waters flowed from mystic night.

With heart aflame with hope and valor unfeigned,
Sir Edward rode on, through mists that whispered truths unknown to gain.
At dusk he spotted ships upon a lake's still surface below,
Their lights like stars ascending from the darkness to bestow.

The Lady of the Lake, in beauty stern apart from gentle beam,
Invited him ashore with magic whispers to make room for knightly dream.
""Come,"" she beckoned softly, as the forest birds took flight,
""I'll grant thee token: one gift of valor, thy name will echo through the night.""

A maiden's voice fair, with sorcery enchanting yet unclear,
Summoned Sir Edward to follow closely through moonlight that doth appear.
With every step on rocky shores he faced untold fears and terrors' sway,
Yet heart afire with courage true, his spirit stood all unwary in disarray.

Upon the lake's silent face a ring of shells did lie
Shining like tiny stars - four stones, inscribed to keep thine own reply.
""Who is thy knight, dear Lady?"" he asked, as he chose four and prayed them to tell,
For honor's sake, that name would echo on, as if 'neath thy lake's still spell.

A hidden voice whispered: ""Thy heart shall wear it bright
As valor marks it true - the chosen one, without a single fight.""

With those four stones thus chosen by silent voices of the night,
Sir Edward stood before yonder Lady, his heart beating with pure delight.

 Thou dost shine like morning stars, and fill my heart with rapturous sighs. Alas, mine own affections rest elsewhere, locked deep within a velvet tomb where they may remain forever unexplored.

Fate, it seems, hath decreed that I shall never be thine, nor thou thyself his. Yet still, I find myself drawn to thy radiant countenance, like one beset by dark enchantment.

In secret chambers of my mind, I confess a longing that doth rival the greatest passions of our time. Oh, how I yearn to unfurl a love-torn heart and yield it unto thee!

I do confess a passion so fierce and all-consuming, that I fear 'twould be folly to pursue it otherwise. Yet still, thy presence holdeth me enthralled like a ship stranded on a stormy sea.

""Slow as did the second, his master told him to complete his work before day's break. 'Twas a task of great complexity, for a king's cloak required many layers and hues. The slow weaver toiled patiently all night long, whilst the swift dweller sought to hasten the process by cunning devices.

""One fateful evening, as both works neared completion, disaster struck! A mighty storm did rage near, threatening to unravel all their handiwork. Yet, when the winds did howl and rain did pour, the slow weaver's cloak remained steadfast, while the swift's tapestry lay rent asunder.

""The king, who had spent the evening attending to his own affairs, rose before dawn to inspect both weavings. Beholding slumbering threads of fate, which held promise yet unforeseen, he spake unto his first weaver: 'How wondrous thy patience hath preserved my cloak!

Their footsteps quiet on the soft earth's decay,
As they explored realms uncharted, come what may.

With gentle care, the Knight tended Galahad's might,
He fed him sweet hay, and watered his eyes bright,
And when he fell from pursuit, in weary fray,
Galahad stood by him, through dawn's gray morning ray.

Their trust transcended time, as epochs went to naught,
For in each other's hearts, their friendship did enshroud,
As days of sunshine joined by ebon star above,
Did symbolize the bond 'twixt mortal and a knight of love.

When battles raged, and strife did shake the land,
The Knight would whisper calm, when Galahad's gentle head did stand,

While others whisper of an unseen presence, ever watching, 'neath the flickering gas lamps' soft, ethereal kiss.

As I wander through this forsaken metropolis, lost in wonder and awe,
I uncover hints of secrets: cryptic graffiti etched upon crumbling walls, as if the ancient ones didst once proclaim
Some truth, now hidden, long since escaped. Forgotten lore doth whisper a tale or two;
Of conspiracies hidden 'neath the city's surface, as whispers spread like wild fire anew.

And yet, I find no peace; as night deepens, shadows grow more sinister still,
The buildings seem to stretch and twist in eerie ways, as if in mystic thrall.
Their surfaces worn until they mirror the dark as midnight's skin;
As though the city itself didst hold a secret known but to those who dwell within.
