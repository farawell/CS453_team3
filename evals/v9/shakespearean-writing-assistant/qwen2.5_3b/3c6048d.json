  "output": "Oft has my bickering Muse with cares been fraught,\nBut now in this hour she yields me her grace and light;\nTo thee, fair Bard, my spirit doth entreat--\nLet sorrow's shadow from thy visage fly!\nThus have I stood by thee in art's twilight drear,\nThou hast so oft by dark and stormy winds been driven:\nArt thou not loath to hear the solace she doth bring?\nHer voice hath often urged me to my knees;\nYon bard dost seem a wight of noble wit:\nNow will she speak, now wilt thou lift thy voice and sing,\nFor oft from far-off lands where lighteth naught but dim\nThe Muse with many-winged words her visit hath:\nAye, this time will I bestow upon thee grace.\nShall I relate my thoughts, to thee I come a thrall?\nWill I unfold the woes that vex me sore and wrack,\nThat oft doth haunt the depths of man's inmost heart\nAnd bring in darkness those which once did light?\nAh faith! Speak for thyself; do not this wonder spare!\nIn token then that thou art worthy, let them bear\nThe weight of aye a parting though yet more sweet\nThan none at all in this new found converse meet.\nTell me how far can be this visit pass,\nAnd dost thou mark the glimmering starry glass?",
