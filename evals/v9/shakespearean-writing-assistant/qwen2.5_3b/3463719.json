  "output": "Fair Lovers Honor√©e,\nThou art as rare as those bright stars that set their glimmer in the darkest night, and my heart hath felt no lighter for thy distant gaze. Haply this day may see thee once more before the closing of our year doth come. In waiting for thy favor's face so rarely shown to me, I oft imagine scenes wherein th'affectionate words of love might find their way towards thy gentler ears.\nHarken, shouldhaps some gentle word or sweetest phrase by me delivered at some private hour, may hasten into light the hopes that hide within my breast and cause thee to do for me as erst thou didst say would come to pass. In th'affirmation of thy love's consent I beg but this: a meeting so unerring that I might feel thine hand upon mine or thine ear toward my whispered desires.\nYet I must rest here, ere the line grows longer and the truth thus hidden from thee doth grow colder still in hearted me. O'er all these thoughts is peace be, and mayhap next year this pen shall find its way unto thy gentle lips, that thy gracious answer may confirm what of late hath danced only upon my silent pages.\nDearest Love,\nYours with the deepest affection and respect,",
