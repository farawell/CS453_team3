  "output": "In the realm where chivalry doth reign, there lived a noble knight named Henry Valor of the Shield. King Edward's knights did oft deplore his valour in battle and valorous deeds.\n\nThe land had ne'er known a more gallant charger with its flowing manes; A champion worthy of thy questing spirit must he be esteemed. \n\nOne stormy night, as stars wept their darkened tears o'er the vale where Valor dwelled, he received an urgent summons from Princess Isolde who, ensnared in perilous plight, bade him aid her, Lady and land alike at stake.\n\nWith his lance brighted red with ancient dyes of blood he rode; Through moonlit forests, over rolling moors until the wild beasts knew his coming and hastened to bow beneath his passing horse's iron shoe.  \n\nUpon reaching the castle's battlements where Isolde did stand within, beset by the wiles of her sorcerous foe Sir Malcian clad in raiment of malice—his dark cloak cloaked with dread - she pleaded for deliverance.\n\nValor valorously delivered. With his lance he pierced and pricked such villain's gaiters until they became a gaping sieve, through which Isolde did escape like the winges'd Zephyr.\n\nThus were Valor's valorous feats known throughout all lands at that time; And many others ever since who've heard thereof in songs of bygone heroes. For he was true as steel and more than all his peers combined, to save a lady whom their very names would disgrace.\n\nThus ended the tale wherein ye may find but a glimpse of my noble knight Henry Valor: A valiant warrior doth stand and shields the fair with valorous worth.",
