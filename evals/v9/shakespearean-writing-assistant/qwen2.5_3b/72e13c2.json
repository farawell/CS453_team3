  "output": "Thou ambitious reign'd upon this realm, And dost thou still usurp the sceptred crown?\nI say it is by right and claim it fair That thine hath ceased of princely empire here; For thou thyself hast plucked it from my grasp By treason's hand to thine own haughty seat.\nWhat claim havest thou that maketh room For thee as master prince? Hast thou the gods' approval?\nNay, let me see - dost thou from whence dost hail That right of rule must be by war and might Derived; or hath a higher wisdom stirred The souls of kings to noblethousandfold? Let me behold thy reasons, if they stand.\nBe it not said that wronging kin demands A title pure and clean as the celestial beams! For nature doth not give from parent's side The right of crown unto their sons by might But ofteth best inheritance doth shine From ancient birth and trust bestowed in kind.\nCan we but see through these false eyes of pride, Thou monarch, thou dost sit with crown'd head agrie\nWith thoughts as dark as darkness, can thy heart Reclaim a thine own? By thee'st decree To those beneath th'earthbound, is dominion given.\nThou art not master of all which thou seest.\nFor thou shalt rise and lowe befallen yet,\nAnd what you seek dost only ever bring ill,\nThy crown and power thou hast with ruin lost,\nAs night hath but an eve that giveth light.\nBehold within thyself; where's more of truth?\nLet us look forth together. Let thy gaze meet With mine, not in the glare but through both hearts met.\nThus may we see the world as it doth stand\nAnd with what virtue to it thou be throned,\nThat which cannot stand from thine own work hath fallen,\nA weight upon our land that only giveth shame.",
