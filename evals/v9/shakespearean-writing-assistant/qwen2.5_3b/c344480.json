  "output": "Yon swashbucklers in the sea's wide embrace, heed this vessel that doth seek thy pardon and remembrance,\nHath it not passed upon me time, e'en as it hath upon all ships? In thine armor didst thou shine like the stars of heaven beneath the watchful eye of the sun.\nNow years agone hath thee cut a swath with swiftness in the wake after battles fought to win the heart or hoard of treasure,\nAnd now I stand on thy once-forgotten deck, but not for strife does my gaze yet dwell. Rather doth it rest upon thine spirit, maimed by deeds unseemly.\nThou art a sailor with a noble brand indeed; not without commendation art thou in the eyes of many mariners who've seen thee sail under such a guise,\nYet know this, brave Captain - hast thou not earned the grace by which to seek renewal and redemption?\nIn me dost thou find a companion for thine erring ways, a soul that doth yearn to mend. Come, let us talk of dreams we may yet chase in the ocean's blue or navigate through troubled waters.\nFor thee hath I set aside my own scars, both past and present day; all hopes are now upon thy course if thou dost wilteth it,\nThou hast already cut a path from which no mortal man can ever sidestep into naught but dire consequence for wrongs so grave.\nThus, the hour doth call thee - come forward to take up once more the sword of virtue and set about the labor to heal thy soul and thy ship as one does with all treasure.\nThy repentance heth it must be written in silver upon parchment, laid under thine mast where every night's moonlight doth bestow its brightest blessing upon thine act of gracefulness.\nSo, now I doth hold forth this offer - join me on a bended knee to ask for thy soul's and our ship's release into thine protection. Let us journey hand in hand beneath a new canopy of pardon over which all eyes may gape at the wondrous beauty we both bring hither.\nFor thee, Captain, what doth it matter now? The weight that once did hang heavy upon thy shoulders hath been replaced by hope and strength - the anchor of redemption. Come then, my friend of many battles with me. Come and make whole what you have wrought so ill.",
