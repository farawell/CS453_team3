Methought that ere I found thee so tumultuous This ocean's calm had held me on my way By paths of joy to port securely.\nBut now hath fate conspired against the heart That dreams not in these waters yet to depart. Doubt and despair, like specters, gather round As thou, fierce Neptune, with thy wrath have bound Me captive in thine endless sea. Oh! What sorrows doth such anguish bring To him that once upon a time did sing Thy siren's song of peace on happier lands!\nYet through this tempestuous tumult may I hear The distant call of land or shore; for though Unbound by ship or sail, mine hopes still hold That ere long the wind shall beckon calm And harbor to my weary soul allow. Thus, with all fervent heart, I pray thee grant my safety doth ensue Till peace once more returneth to our way!",
