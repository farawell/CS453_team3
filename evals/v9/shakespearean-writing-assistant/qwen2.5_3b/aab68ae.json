  "output": "Within the verdant vale wherein thy feet now doth tread, a secret land of grace hath long been kept from sight unseen, for in a mist so thick and ever blinding it hath eluded mortal ken. A man of waning days, within the folds of time but still emboldened by a questing spirit, came wandering in and there his chance was fair to meet with wonder's veil.\n\nUpon a path oft times undisturbed he journeyed forth, its very purpose known only unto earths unthinking earthen foot. Till one morn when sun did rise and golden beams began their ascent on dew-bejeweled blooms so bold of heart, an emerald verdure did beckon to his call.\n\nHe paused, with wonder stirred in his soul's deep throb, as erstwhile he looked about with wondering eye upon that valley yet unknown. A verdant landscape lay before him where the air itself did whisper mysteries not heard by all within its bounds; and through there crept a cool, faint murmur of the stream whose waters sweetly rippled o'er the stones.\n\nWith feet unheedful where paths lay hidden 'neath the thicket's guise, his steps led onward with each footfall gentle to the ground. And well he knew at last when mystery called him forth. The sun did slip and hide himself in cloud that cloak'd the heavens high above. Through shadows then a form of being dark and still yet lit by silent moonlight shone: an owl whose wings beat forth for all who hear her cry.\n\nA whisper soon came to his ear, from depths where only silence does reside, a voice hearkening and heeding now with all eyes veiling his sight.\n\"Hast thou found yon valley's secrets hitherto unseen?\"  \nThe traveler heard not but answered yet within the stillness thus did speak:\n\"Ah yes, my guide hath brought me here. Now dost thou name it as the vale of hidden mysteries.\"\nThus was it done with such humility to heed the voice, yet in a world where words are oft ignored by eyes only. Thus our man, having sought a path for all to follow, found not that land of unknown which had been long unseen. But he did take away with him the memory of secrets kept and tales untold, for within his heart remained a silent echo of what shall surely be its namesake when time's passing brings it forth once more - a hidden valley known at last by man.\nEnd",
