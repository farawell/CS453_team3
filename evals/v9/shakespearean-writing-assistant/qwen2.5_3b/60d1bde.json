  "output": "Methought it best, in such tempests of the stage-to-malevolence and mortals'-fate; \nAn actor should thus frame his plot-a-tragic tale wherein thou dost behold an epitome of man's imperfections.\nThe mortal shall be named as he with flaws so vast doth stand, doomed by a fatal flaw that strikes him from within.\nA hero, fair-haired in all outward semblance and valorous deeds, yet darkly veiled beneath the mask of glory.\nFor in his heart doth nestle pride, and therein lies his downfall-sad for him, who shall fall by his own misdeed.  \nHow shall I frame this verse of tragedy whereby both hearts weep tears and spirits soar-our hero's tale to recount?",
