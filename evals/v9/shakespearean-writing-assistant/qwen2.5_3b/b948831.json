  "output": "Upon the firmament's expanse doth hang, Starlight, like pearls in silver nets they cling; By night they twinkle softly as fair maidens' eyes Whose silent whispers steal upon thy dreams.\n\nThe sea beneath the welkin's veiled brow, Swells and subsides where no man can behold its flow. The waves that crest like ocean-tempered harps, Sing forth a symphony of ancient scars.\n\nBoth are unyielding, neither do they flee Where'er the winds their course intent shall weave. In skies or seas they sing the song of fate From which no mortal escapes, though oft we cheat.\n\nYet does the sky more gently caress, With gentle showers and soft breezes' breath; The waves that dance in wrath can yet be blest Under heaven's mercy with their calm aftermath.\n\nThus doth the heavens compare to ocean deep, As storm and calm beneath them ever keep. For both are witnesses of mortal weal And in their boundless realms remain.",
  "compliance": "err",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot output features a creative poem that appears to comply well with the Shakespearean style. The use of expressive and poetic language is present, and the text includes metaphorical language, such as comparing starlight to \"pearls in silver nets\" and personifying the skies and seas. Also present is the reflective nature of the content that is characteristic of Shakespeare's works, pondering the relationship between the sky and the ocean. However, for explicit Shakespearean language, words such as \"thou,\" \"hath,\" \"wherefore,\" and \"thee\" are notably absent from this text. These specific terms are vital markers of Shakespearean style, as outlined in the description. \n\nTherefore, the lack of explicit Shakespearean words like \"thou\" and \"hath\" marks the primary non-compliance with the chatbot description. The output is poetic and somewhat Shakespearean in tone, but it lacks the specific archaic words required by the description.\n\nERR"
