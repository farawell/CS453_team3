  "output": "Upon these verdant banks where hues do blend,\nThere lies a lilt, most ethereal and sweet,\nWhich through the leafy veils and mossy strands\nSoars upward on the soft, caressing air.\n\nIn this fair forest's hallowed grove abode,\nA murmured tune doth breathe its silken chain;\nIts tones not by such human voice bestowed,\nBut from a woodland sprite with silver stain.\nShe who doth sing this melody divine\nWith breath as pale as moonlit boughs that slumber,\nHer strains do softly penetrate the vine\nAnd gently through each bough and leaf implore.\n\nThe bird's sweet chime, and fowl's harmonious note,\nJoin in this symphony of green delight.\nBut none compare to her who lingers late\nTo weep with silver tears her voice that glides,\nAs if from music's self the melody doth rise.\n\nOh, listen well! With ears of maiden care,\nAnd ye shall see a forest more than fair.",
