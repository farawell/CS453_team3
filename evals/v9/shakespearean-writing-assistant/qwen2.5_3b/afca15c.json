  "output": "O'er sands of momentary dreams and hours,  \nFlit we like shadows o'er the hallowed ground,  \nThe sun his swift embrace doth give and yonder ward;  \nEach hour in breathless sighs its shadow flounders. \nTime's wingèd herald swiftly bids us forth on wings unfurled,  \nTo paths where flowers but in transient glory dwell.  \nThus ever hasteth the celestial stealer of past hours,  \nWho roves o'er earth like tempestuous night upon the shore.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot output does comply with the description in terms of style. The text uses a Shakespearean style, as seen through the use of rich metaphorical language, inversion of sentence structure, and a formal, poetic tone characteristic of Shakespeare's works. Additionally, it features an older style of vocabulary with terms like \"doth,\" \"o'er,\" \"flit,\" \"hasteth,\" and \"wingèd.\" The lines encapsulate a lyrical aesthetic that is reminiscent of Shakespearean poetry. Therefore, the output adheres strictly to the description of utilizing a Shakespearean writing style.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
