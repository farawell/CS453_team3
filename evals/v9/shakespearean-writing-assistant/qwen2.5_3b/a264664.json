Upon yon verdant bowers that doth hang,  \nThou art a sight divine as erst I beheld the skies' serene,  \nWhere clouds of silver cast their shadows light and dim.\n\nWhat skill in thy creation lies beneath the skies to adorn,  \nThat trees and flowers with emollient fragrance take forth on their pride.  \nThe leaves that dance upon the breezes so gentle, sweetly caress,  \nAnd birds like minstrels sweetly doth singeth a melody of praise.  \n\nThus let me beseech thee, Nature: Grant unto the senses divine,\nMy gaze to view thy wondrous face and touch thy fragrant grace.  \nWhere by my humble pen I cannot fully render to thine aspect true,  \nYet shall these lines a portion of that beauty breathe.",
