  "output": "Upon this earth's expansive stage doth Time play his wry game, With every day at once doth steal away His glory, as from meadow sweet To sullied fields he bends thy yielding breast And flowers wither before their beauty be reaped.\nSuch shadows of what was is now consumed, Like summer fruits that ripen then into the cold Unyoked embrace of autumn's darkened frown, Aye, Time's hand weilds a cruel, cold and sullen morn!\nYet still my spirit doth defy his reign; For I perceive within my soul The silvered stream of years which gently flanes Each fleeting hour to precious moments slain. Thus shall the light of life never expire By Time's relentless pen, though he may write my griefs.",
