  "output": "Thou art a thing of beauty, Time unrolls his canvas wide,\nWhere summer sun with cheek ablaze doth paint thy fields in green,\nAnd Autumn comes with leafy hues that gently kiss the earth below.\nWinter chills thee with stark whiteness, barren forms bespeak the age,\nAnd spring renews thy breath and growth. Thus, seasons pass like ships\nUpon the sea, each changing scene doth hint of what shall be and past.\n\nHow dost thou find this verse, or would I add some spice to it?",
