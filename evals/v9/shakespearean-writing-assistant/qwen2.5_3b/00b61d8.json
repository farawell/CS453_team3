  "output": "Marked be thou for this task, to weave in thy tongue an eloquent dance wherein thou wilt ensconce the folly of wars that rage unbidden.\nThus shall I begin, as we contrive our themes before the stage:--\n\nMark:\nBy heaven and earth, what futility dost thou discern within the shield or sword? Nay more, can one win by slaying?\n\nJuliet:\nMarketh well, in arm and armor clad they march in pomp to perish. Yet no victory hath they found for all their strife.\nI'll argue thus: To be at war is ever an act of madness, wherein many fall, yet many more perished when the armies clashed.\n\nHarken hither: 'Tis folly that these captains chase with valiant blade and noble spear, each doth march to a pitiful end; all for nothing in time's swift dance. Thus I declare, war is but an empty shadow where no real gain appear.\n\nMark:\nAnd dost thou find sweet solace in such discourse?\n\nJuliet:\nNay not, Marketh well what profit hath it seen the many? Their efforts have been both a costly jest and vain misprision of their very selves.\nThus I propose: Let love prevail, let us mend those harms through kindred affections; these alone are truly worth the while. For truth, all doth find that war only bringeth sorrow where no bliss ensue.\n\nMark:\nIt seemeth thou dost speak with a heart's true voice. Yet in this light of light can I seek not aid for strife, but rather look to peace as our guiding light. And let me say: Thy argument hath been wise and profound, thou art like a shepherdess teaching flocks within the fields. Let us pray that all wars may end, thy wisdom be with thee - ever.\nEnd thus, let it rest within the hearth where tales are told of noble peace by many ears. For truly doth I find comfort in thy words - this discourse hath been most fitting and clear as summer's dews upon the grass.",
