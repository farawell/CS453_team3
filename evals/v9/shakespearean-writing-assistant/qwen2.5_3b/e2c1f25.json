  "output": "Upon the brow of night where shadows softly rest,\nBy light of amber skies and fireweed hues doth meet,\nThe hour wherein the day with sleepy slumber dyes,\nAnd whispers in its hush, a calm's contentment sweet.\nThe twilight holds within her tender grasp,\nA grace by day hath left behind its pride,\nIn peace she broods upon each hidden sprite\nOf verdure and of flower, that breathe but lowly pride.\n\nWhere rose and gold in one sweet confluence meet,\nShe steals the light from eyes so bold with sun's display,\nAnd hushes all into a soft entreaty:\nFor in her shadow there, doth Nature sing most gay.\nYet e'en this brief respite pales before the hour when\nThe crescent moon reappears, to take her place once more.",
