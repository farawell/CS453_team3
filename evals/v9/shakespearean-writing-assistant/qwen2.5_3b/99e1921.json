  "output": "Amid the world's great wreathe, wherein the sun and star do reign, hath ever lain an Eden, lost in lore and time. This nameless land, where oft men have enquiring sought - I mean that which is named Opheliac. A realm o'er which a queen hath ruled with grace so pure it hath been remembered only by the shadows of her courts.\nSuch doth befall this tale: The Queen Cecilia who didst dwell in beauty's guise, alluring love upon a hill she built in silver grey, beneath each crescent moon and starlit night. A realm that doth not lie at surface but is hid as does the soul of secret knights.\nBut alas, time hath passed away, forgetting oft her name and place. So, though no map doth trace it, nor song can yet be traced to sing thereof; its glory still may breathe through ancient wood where love's soft breezes dwell untold, till doomsday or a brave one return to find a glimmer of the realm so lost.\nSo hear this story true: The tale of Opheliac, named by none save who within his breast did ponder loss - it is both past and yet forever in our hearts.",
