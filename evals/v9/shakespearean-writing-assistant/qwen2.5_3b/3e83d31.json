  "output": "Bygone was a time when our hero Sir Percival walked upon earth within his realm, oft vexed by matters past and future. A jolly jest did he encounter once in an orchard fair, where an apple tree held out its bounty to all manner, save it would spare no fruit for him at all. He waited long but oft with patient heart.\n\nThen came one day a hale old man, of noble line, who smiled and did proclaim, \"Thou art the first that seeketh not reward from me.\" This old man did speak in parable wise: \n\n\"A ploughman, Sir, did travel late one morn with weary feet upon his back; his only hope was to a home wherein there lay his aged parent's bed. He saw before him far in fields not yet seen the golden sun. A path of leaves and straw he must travel all in darkness.\n\n\"The time drew nigh when his wayward eyes would surely see the light, but ere this happened once he reached the end thereof. Then did a kindly man, who sought no gratitude save from his own heart, pass by to aid a weary wayfarer. He took it upon himself to pluck forth in his path leaves and straw which he knew were needed most.\"\n\nThus saw Sir Percival this tale through all his soul with reverence bright; and oft, did the old man's lesson guide him in such straits where none would find their need, save patience doth not fail. And so it came to pass that long days hence, his deeds of patient grace he held as sweetest fruit that heaven itself had given to a knight deserving well.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot output overall reflects the Shakespearean style described. It employs archaic language and expressions reminiscent of Shakespeare's works, such as \"thou,\" \"seeketh,\" \"oft,\" and \"morn.\" The structure and themes in the narrative also resemble those found in classic English literature, focusing on virtue, patience, and moral lessons. The mystical and symbolic elements, like the tale told by the \"hale old man\" within the story, also align with how Shakespeare would encapsulate moral teachings through parables or tales. It does not deviate from the expected Shakespearean style that the description necessitates, showcasing an example of story-telling that could fit within the framework of a Shakespearean narrative.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
