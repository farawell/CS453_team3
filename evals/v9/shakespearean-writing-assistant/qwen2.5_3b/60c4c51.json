  "output": "Hark! Art thou king of halls and all that lies therein, my liege? So be it, then, I enter servitude by an oath as loyal as the stars above shine. Thou art my master, thy will is mine. Should fortune play light in my path or weigh heavy upon it; for life and limb, for love of thee doth I pledge myself. What thou commandest I obey from morning till night's hour shall come, as true as is a knight's promise to his liege lord. Thine ever loyal hanger-on this most humble subject prayeth with heart full to thee in service true.",

  "complianceText": "The output is written in a Shakespearean style, adhering well to the characteristics described. It uses archaic words and phrases such as \"Hark,\" \"thou,\" \"liege,\" \"thy,\" \"doth,\" and \"shall,\" which are reminiscent of Shakespeare's language style. The text also employs a formal and poetic tone that is consistent with the examples provided in the description, like addressing someone of higher status in a noble and subservient manner. \n\nNo violation.\n\nOK"
