  "output": "So mote it be. Upon this theme dost thou entreat? Let me conceive in verse the transient bloom of days. For beauty fleeting doth most oft allure, and as the morning star shineth soon the stars that glister fade away.\nVerily then shall I unfold a tale,\nOf sunbeams brief and moon's ethereal pale,\nHow even when Nature decks with golden hue\nHer flowers in splendor so fair, they too must die.",
