  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The output utilizes a Shakespearean writing style, evident from the use of archaic language such as \"didst,\" \"doth,\" \"hath,\" \"abeyant,\" \"thou,\" and expressions that resemble early modern English used in Shakespeare's works. The structure and rhythm also mimic the style found in Shakespearean poetry and writing. Therefore, the output adheres to the description by consistently employing the Shakespearean writing style expected from the chatbot.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
