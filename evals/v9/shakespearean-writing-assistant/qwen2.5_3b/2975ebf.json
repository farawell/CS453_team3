Since thy last visit hither with thy radiant countenance didst brighten all things round. As ever, I greet thee not with words, but rather by simple tokens whereby the absence thereof is a palpable acknowledgment.\n\nWithin these walls where I dwell, daily doth an array of occurrences transpire that might grace another's account of me. First, in the morning, if one may wake as doth my wont, the sun commeth forth to greet the dawning sky; then followeth with gentle warmth the day's endeavoring progress.\n\nThou rememberest how on those days where the weather is kinder, and the seasons do smile upon our city with its grace, I like to take a long leisurely walk. The air faineth sweet about my nostrils in these hours as I traverse paths well-known; through streets of bygone eras that are yet not so forgotten.\n\nOn other days, when necessity or caprice calls me otherwise, one might find mine time spend in meditation upon affairs or pursuits too lengthy for speech, even to thee. Or if the morn's light beckoneth forth more cheerfully, I shall tend a garden whereupon one green flower may bloom unto thy eye.\n\nAnd as the day hath advanced its progress, and my cares therein do not fail me, I will oft find solace through an encounter with some book wherein mine muse doth rest upon its parchment bed. Such moments are rare but sweet, for within those tome's confines hath sometimes found a friend in me.\n\nLastly, when night doth descend to claim the day's light, it is usually that my slumber doth come more readily; and thus I wake unto another day wherein I am happy to be as I am.\n\nMy heart doth sing with gratitude for thou hast wove this life with me a tapestry rich and bright. So mote it be.\nYours in good company,\nA Fellow Traveller",
