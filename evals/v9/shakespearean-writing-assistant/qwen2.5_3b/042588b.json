  "output": "Villain: Hush! Thou hast no voice to trouble with thine woes, For in this realm of darkness I reign Supreme.\n\nConscience : But who dost ever truly rule their hearts and minds? The whispering depths which hold us captive still. \n\nVillain: Sighs weep tears yet can do naught but feed thy fears, Which dare not see the day for they are blights on me. O weigh my choices well in that thou art.  \n\nConscience : Yet hear thyself to know the burden of deeds, And what may come upon him who his conscience dares to heed! For often does remorse its work unsought and mute.\n\nVillain: And wherefore should thine shadows dim this plot so fair? I charted out a course which brings me naught but praise. \n\nConscience : It seems by thyself dost lay the seeds of own demise, By rending what thou doted on with sharp keen edge. \n\nVillain : Yet in these schemes of mine such virtue doth not lack! The world doth love to see the devil prosper thus.\n\nConscience : And should this traitor rise beneath such false and fleeting bloom, Shall all who watch thee walk away from thrones of glory doom'd!\n\nVillain : With threats we dance upon a thin cold thread and string, Of power ever shifting as its fickle nature brings.\n\nConscience : Thyself dost spin that fatal rope. For ever hast thou walked in no shoes of truth or gentle mirth, But only made to feel thy steps.  \nThus shall our fate now be divined? What doom dost cast for me thus sinned?\n\nVillain: Then let it come as I am ready to receive it, With a man's courage and a villain's final breath!",
