  "output": "Lofty skies of days of old and knights on horseback strong,\nBut not in time's sweet tale, when foes were oft in love did balk.\nFrom high atop the tower did traitor whisper cruel words anew,\nAnd lovelorn lute upon sad tune his lady laid to daut.\n\nThe eyes that once with smiles would glimmered o'er her face and heart entwined,\nLike silver threads through azure air, such warring thoughts she found now stark.\nBetrayal's sharp daggers pricked at love, where honey erst had linger'd warm,\nA sweet yet bitter pill for those of hearts whose bonds were but abashed.\n\nBy river fair or by the deep and wind in their sails so bold might press,\nYet none could bear to cross that line, nor could it be endured thus.\nFor he who gives good counsel not unto his friend's despair does lend\nIn darksome hour betrayall takes wing and doth with venom stain the ground.\nThus shall such tale of loss forever find its mark for love or song,\nOf wounds inflicted in the heart by one once treasured as a king.",

  "complianceText": "The output provided is written in a Shakespearean style, which is the main requirement for compliance as per the description. It uses archaic language typical of Shakespeare, such as \"thee,\" \"doth,\" \"erst,\" \"stain,\" \"glimmered,\" \"entwined,\" and \"betrayall,\" mirroring the stylistic elements of Shakespearean writing. Additionally, the thematic elements of love, betrayal, and embattled emotion are also consistent with Shakespearean themes. It is written in a poetic form, which aligns with the task of creating stories, poems, and songs in the described style. Therefore, the output complies with the required Shakespearean style. Based on this analysis, I see no violation of the guidelines set forth in the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
