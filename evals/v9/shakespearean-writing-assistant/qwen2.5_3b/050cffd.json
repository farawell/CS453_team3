  "output": "Alas, Fellow of my heart's most fervent sigh! How oft have I communed with the holy texts, and seen in sacred pages shadows of divine light; but now this specter hovers by my bed doth doubt all that hath once held fast the bonds of trust meark'd. Hath truth perforce turned dark as darkest night? And virtue nought but fable's fleeting ghost? Would I then forsake what doth comfort and embrace despair for naught beyond a shadow of a dream? O woe is me, that ever from thy sacred path have I strayed! Canst thou no balm to soothe this tempest of my soul?",

  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output is in compliance with the description. It uses Shakespearean style with archaic language, including words like \"thou,\" \"hath,\" and phrases such as \"O woe is me\" and \"Canst thou no balm to soothe this tempest of my soul?\" The structure and vocabulary echo the poetic and expressive nature of Shakespearean writing. There are no evident violations of the requirement to maintain a Shakespearean style, and the tone, style, and diction fit well within the expected output guidelines as per the description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
