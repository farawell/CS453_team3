  "output": "Queen, wherein should I begin? My heart doth heave within my breast. Thou knowest well of late thy realms have thriven and prospered. Yet every morning as the sun upriseth, doubts and cares assail me thus.\n\nOh how oft in the hush of night has sorrow struck like a tempest's blast! 'Tis then that all my thoughts on thee do gather - for within them is thine image laid to rest who once was queen, yet now a dream deferred. My kingdom, though it flourisheth in peace and beauty as doth thine arms, lacks the steadfast heartbeat of true love.\n\nHow else can I find solace save within my own heart? How else but by mine own hand uproot that which is grown unseasonably, with such wild disarray? Mine subjects look upon me as a king's crown, yet in truth they yearn for some gentle queen, not like thine avenges.\n\nIn these times so dark and doubtful doth my spirit wander: oft I have stood at thy ancestral gates and gazed out o'er the land with eyes of thine, where once did reign such splendor.\n\nWhat remedy shall guide me thus if this unquiet feeling ever be assuaged? Whereby can I find calm in seasons so restless, as they are not my own to rule. Would it come from thy soft touch upon my brow as years ago, nor hearthfire's warmst embrace would soothe the soul?\n\nThus must I face within myself a truth that is beyond words- I have no means of change but mine own. What manner of counsel else can I call for save this weary search? For in thy image doth my being rest, and without thee loatheth my kingdom all alone.",
