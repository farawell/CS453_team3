  "output": "A most worthy bequest it is to consider the transgression of faith and o'er that theme unfold some pensive penance, my dearest friend.\n\nIn former times it hath been written thus: \"Faith betrays none save him whose heart doth but contain a false light.\" Thou hast witnessed now what hath come to pass. The trust between us hath waxed dark through the envenomed shaft of treachery and betrayal struck like daggers into our bonds.\n\nHast thou felt the shadow upon our spirit's dawn? Hath the very air grown heavy, as if it held within its bosom all the sighs and sorrows from a heart bereft with sorrow? Alas, doth not such loss feel more cruel than sharp swords or piercing flames?\n\nThe test of friendship is sore when truth is lost; then is loyalty but shadowed under a cold and leaden sky. Yet can we ever doubt that silver wings of hope yet fly above the storm, as surely it will lift us from their dark descent.\n\nForgive me, friend, for if the sun doth rise again to pierce through tempest's darkest mists, then may the hopes that rest within thy bosom begin to bloom once more under the sheltered sky.\nThus have I pondered and put forth my thoughts. Mayhap thine own sentiments differ when they come from thee. My heart doth seek solace in hope as we both must find our course now through the tempest of despair.\nA friend dost thou remain, true or false; that much is certain, yet all else we know must wait until such day looms before us, revealing itself like one who walks unseen beneath a darkening sky.",
