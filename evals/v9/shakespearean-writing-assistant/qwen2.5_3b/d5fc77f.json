I speak, not from mirth nor jesting heart, but with a tearful voice for those days when we did intertwine like roses, sweet as music played under moonlit skies. Alas, though nature doth decree that time can erelong passeth by and turneth our paths, yet let us still remember the love of fellowship once shared within this breast. O how thou wilt miss it like an arrow shot far from target!",
