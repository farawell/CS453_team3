  "output": "In tempest-tossed night's eyes doth weeps the sable storm,\nWhen darkness wraps thee all in darkling boughs of gloom.\nSleep, gentle one, from morn's fair face dost yet arise not quite,\nThou art athwart the arms of rest - so softest silences lift.\nHark as the silent whispers kiss each starlet o'erhead,\nAnd let them draw you gently to a velvet veil of sleep.\nNo moan of waker or loud drum of drowsy day can dare to keep\nYou from your peaceful peace, my child in dreams so sweetly steep'd.\nLet ruddy roses guard thee as the night doth kindly watch,\nMay fairest silences shield thee, and may morn's dewdrop break thy fasten't mass.\nSo let not stars weep at thy restless breast their silver tears to drop,\nNor night its pattering feet against thy peaceful bedsoffet.\nTo thee, my child, a lullaby of gentle skies does bring;\nWherein the sleep of peace shall all your restless watch doth bring.\nWith hushed hearts and softest sighs let this sweet drowsy dance come play,\nAnd may your night's unrest with these fair shadows be allayed.",
