  "output": "Sir Knight,\nThou hast sent a plea to this realm's borders, beseeching thy valorous presence beneath the crimson sky of distant lands. Haste I do not deny thee, but in reply with pen and ink, I must inform thee that tidings from realms beyond have weighed heavy upon me. A bond unspoken between us erstwhile hath ripened into a vow more solemn now for I am aboard the ocean's backthrust to return hither.\n\nI, albeit heartenew'd by tales yet unexperienced of lands wherein knights and ladies dwellâ€”where the sun doth not set as it is known in these regions--can report, that from thine call to combat hath come a peace in my ears. It seems that I am more called unto thee here amidst this realm's perils.\n\nThou shalt hear, I trust thy tale, when time hath spun between us and the winds have ceased their chiding call of land's departure. To be thy comrade within these troubled times hath given me strength to traverse what my foes across sea or shore shall not conquer.\nThine,\nA Crusader's heart, long voyaging under skies unlike our own.",
