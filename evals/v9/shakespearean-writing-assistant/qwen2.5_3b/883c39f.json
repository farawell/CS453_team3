  "output": "Yon summers' blossoms blown, they doth not last;  \nEven thus with youth we live at full and wax,  \nThen fade, as quickly as the fleeting night.  \nThou art fair now, but in time shall this bloom pass.\n\nFairest among the trees of life's green grove,  \nBloom thou but brief for thy sweet bud doth sprout  \nAnd wither hastes; so must young beauty glow,  \nAnd in her glory soon doth quickly grow.  \n\nGleaming like sun-born gold upon a crest,  \nThou shinest o'er all creatures of this land,  \nBut fairest bloom is but tonight's light,  \nSo fair that I did marvel and with awe behold thee stand.\n\nHow short our days! The summer, now well-nigh flown,  \nLeaves us so soon as winter calls to bed,  \nAnd in the breath of Spring again doth blow  \nNew buds, not old. So goeth youth at swift pace led.\n\nI know that oft sweet blossoms wither down,\nThat flowers bloom for but brief day's dance and flowâ€™r,\nThe same did blossom once upon a crown  \nThen perished then; but now I say no more.\n\nYea then, farewell, fair beauty, till thy next,\nIn yon return to life when Spring doth rise again.",
