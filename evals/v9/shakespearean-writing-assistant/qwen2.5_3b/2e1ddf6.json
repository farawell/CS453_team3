In legend's tongue she was fair and of ancient lore sought as much, her visage veiled by the mist of mystery, yet in her embrace lay a boon most holy.\n\nHenceward, Sir Percival took forth his lance so bright and shield with crest whereon deeds of valour past did seem and hearth he oft had 'gainst the foe's distress. From farthest lands came he, a man of grace and spirit keen, yet in heart there burned desire to traverse this mystical quest.\n\nUpon a day under a full moon's gaze was Sir Percival arrayed in garb all bold with shield adown his arms most gleaming and sword beside him did he carry. To seek her where the glen is verdant fair that winds by lake of crystal clear, and boughs that shade it as sweet dreams ensue. And lo! The night came swiftly upon this quest.\n\nIn searchward of her sought Sir Percival, amidst wild woodland's green and streams where water doth so flash, where shadows long the land with mystery clothe his path did take. At last he found her place in glen untamed by men, nor winds, but there she stood, as legend tells. And thus commenced his journey, fraughted with perilous quest upon unknown ground.\n  \nThus ended tale of Sir Percival's adventure to seek the Lady of the Lake, through wild realms brave and myst'ry's embrace. She still remains her ancient lore so fondly told by those most dear in stories spun.",
