  "output": "Upon the starlit vault above,\nWhere shadows play with midnight glove,\nIn secret chambers of the mind,\nA melody of mystic find.\n\nThe wraiths of whispers, ethereally high,\nCreep through the silence like a ghostly sigh.\nWhat thine ear cannot capture, let thy heart hear,\nFor oft in dreams are we inspired far.\n\nFrom skies that seem to quench their light with care,\nLofty heights and deep cauldrons dare.\nUpon these realms of dream's entwined song,\nLie secrets only night can bring.\n\nWhere twilightâ€™s hues upon the face of day,\nAre veiled in mystery, as misty sky.  \nHere whispers softly pass from unseen shore,\nBeneath silent moon where shadows go more shy.\n\nThus art thou called, to dance along these hallowed threads,\nThrough realms that are the secrets of good deeds.\nFor though we see not, know I that they are here,\nIn fields of night where all that is and shall be.",
