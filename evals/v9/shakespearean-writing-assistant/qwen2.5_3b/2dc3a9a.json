In these quiet scenes where silver light o'erhead doth crease\n    OUR FAREWELLS come to gentle befalling.\n\nLOVESTRONGER: How oft dost thou behold this silver orb, and in thy gaze wilt thee ensnare?\nLOVECROWNS: And what of this enchantment? When I see the moon up soething high,\n    She is my guide, she leads me into blissful dreams and bright desires.\nLOVESTRONGER: Can nothing quench from thee thy fondling on these lunar visions, then, fair queen?\nLOVECROWNS: Alas! If I have any power to hold fast the moonward stars so high,\n    Then may I be as starlit as she is; to see this radiant sight doth lie.\n\nLOVESTRONGER: To what canst thou not aspire? When from my heart and all our love flows unspent in thy view,\n    What dost thou loathe, sweet girl, when all the world cannot keep me in its dew?\nLOVECROWNS: Thou wilt not ask of me within these silken shadows to reveal another name,\n    But know mine innermost thoughts and I myself be witness, this moonlit night am I.\n    \nLOVESTRONGER: Ah, wondrous star! The very touch thy eyes enkindle from afar doth make my blood boil,\n    How sweetest then I call thee by the silver orb of Heaven's bliss divine?\nLOVECROWNS: Thou art indeed a lover most renowned, wherefore dost thou bring to me so fervent prayers?\n\nAnd with these sighs and vows in heart our lips part at each other's breast, so tenderly,\n    Under this hallowed sky whose silken curtains cover stars so bright.\nHERE be thee depart from moonlit moanings, evermore I pine for thy repose.\n    \nLOVESTRONGER: Farewell, fair love.\nLOVECROWNS: Farewell, my lord.",
