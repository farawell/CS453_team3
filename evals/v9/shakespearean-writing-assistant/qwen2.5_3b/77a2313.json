  "output": "Fair Rose that dost thy blushes in the sun bestow, A garden's pride by lovers with thine honor crowned; Thy fragrance sweet doth win the heart unsoiled as thou The very first glimpse casteth in Eden's bourn.\nThou hast a stem of gold unto the touch so frail To kiss which doth each lover in their bliss enthrall; And every flower that doth thy name dost wear In service to thee, for thine beauty scarce can fare.\nThus in thy bloom dost thou outshine all earthly blooms, With petals as fair as love's first sweetest roons. May I but tend unto thee with care and trust Thine grace will ne'er cease while I thus under thee doth drest.",

The text uses several Shakespearean elements, such as archaic words and phrases like \"thou,\" \"dost,\" \"hath,\" and \"doth.\" The sentence structure and poetic flourishes also mirror the style of Shakespeare, employing a formal and ornate tone typical of Elizabethan English. The text maintains a consistent Shakespearean style throughout, which aligns with the chatbot's described role as a Shakespearean writing assistant.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
