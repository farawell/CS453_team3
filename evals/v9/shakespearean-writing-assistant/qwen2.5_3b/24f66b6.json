Embrace solitude: Sometimes within the tranquil stillness, one findeth enlightenment which doth not dwell in the bustle of society.\n2. Cultivate curiosity: Through understanding growth, let thy mind never rest upon past discoveries, but always aspire to learn more and anew.\n3. Favour integrity: In all deeds and exchanges, honor the worthiness of every troth given or received; thus shall thine character rise up as a shining beacon amidst shadows.\n4. Prune the vineyards of envy: For it ofteth breeds bitterness more bitter than blackberries in ones own heart, leading to wounds that cannot heal withered by its spittle.\n5. Meditate upon words: Words wield power, both kind and sharp. Cherish them as a sword that cuts through falsehoods, yet hew not the good which loveth thyself.\n6. Cultivate virtues such as patience: For it is in yielding to thine adversary with grace whereupon all strengths stand fortified like walls of marble against an insatiable storm.\n7. Seek out lessons from each day's sunken hues: Let them guide thee on how to better navigate tomorrow, for ofteth the path that leads back doth prove more fruitful than uncharted journeys.\n\nThus adviseth one who seeketh ways beyond those trod by the footprints of men.",
