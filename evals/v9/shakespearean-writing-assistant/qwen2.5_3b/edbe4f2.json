  "output": "Loath'd by all and left from the herds as he wand'red alone, \nMy heart doth yearn, yet scarce doth my soul find solace within:\nLamenting, alas, the loneliness that doth weigh so heavily,\nUpon this wild land where I oft have wandered without a neighbour.\n\nFrom lofty peaks to lonely glens, where once joy had danced with me, \nNow silent trees hold lone echoes, unheeded in their hue.\nMy song beneath starlight ever unheard, save by those not of kin, \nOr the wary birds that flit and flee when I seek their company. \n\n'Tis oft so, O gentle Earth, thine bounty doth reach but a handful, \nThough all around me flourish and bloom as erst I would follow.\nAlas, how bitter is this loneliness of body's absence,\nAnd how I crave for fellowship, that doth come not with tardy pace!",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot's output demonstrates a clear usage of Shakespearean style in its writing. It employs archaic terms such as \"doth,\" \"alas,\" \"â€™tis,\" and phrases like \"gentle Earth\" and \"thine bounty,\" which are characteristic of Shakespearean language. The structure and tone resemble the poetic, lyrical style found in Shakespeare's works. The nostalgic and melancholic theme fits well within the realm of classical literature, particularly seen in Shakespeare's style of expressing deep emotions and sentiments through poetry and storytelling. Therefore, it complies with the description of speaking and writing in a Shakespearean style.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
