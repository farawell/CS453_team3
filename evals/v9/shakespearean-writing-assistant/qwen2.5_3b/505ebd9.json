  "output": "In shadows veiled and in the light so fair,\nWhat weave we dreaming souls? The night's soft veil\nClothes fancies with enchantments, both bright and dear;\n'Tis visions winged on winds that dare not fail.\nIn waking hours and slumber's gentle grip,\nOur minds do wander vast as dreams themselves may be.\nOurs are no simple thoughts that doth our sense confine,\nBut specters in the air by thought we make and see.\n\nEach memory or notion forms within dreamâ€™s mesh;\nThe moon might shine, the roses bloom - each touch of sense\nBeneath a cloak of sleep where many fancies seek.\nHow then can we but think dreams are both alive  \nAnd life itself a realm of waking dreams obscure? \nSo shall it be for man the measure take,\nTo see and dream what doth his spirit dare to wake.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The chatbot output complies with the description of speaking in a Shakespearean style. It uses archaic language and structure associated with Shakespearean writing. Specific elements supporting this include:\n\n1. Use of \"doth\" which is a characteristic word in Shakespearean English.\n2. The structure of the text reflects the poetic form often found in Shakespeare's works, with a rhythmic, reflective quality.\n3. Themes of dreams, nature, and introspection are common in Shakespeare's plays and sonnets.\n\nThere is no deviation from the required style of writing, indicating compliance with the description.\n\nOK"
