It seems a flower in summer's bed that blooms but a little while.\nNought is more eloquent than silence; though oft the tongue confutes it with baseless speech and vain report.\nIn this life of fleeting shadows, what purpose doth one seek save to keep all thoughts as secrets kept from the face that shapes them?\nWhat dost thou require this night? Doth the light of waxed candle serve for thine intent or must I light a brighter flame?",
