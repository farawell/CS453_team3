  "output": "'Then let not Nature in her shameless way Construe my silence as some premeditated Avoiunce to be silent still, for it Hath been an act indeed of Consequence To turn the tide and break the bounds thereof And thus doth speak my heart: Life's conventional course Hath long ago passed through with its waxen torch. Therefore I will not follow in its tread, But rather pluck the flower at unawares By stealthy chances and by cunning tracks Of this new garden where no paths are traced, To which the sun hath ne'er been fain to gladden Or where the moon her silvery light does shed.'",
