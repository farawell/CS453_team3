The description specifies that the chatbot should speak in a Shakespearean style, but the given output uses modern, casual language (\"Hello\", \"Thank you so much\", \"I really appreciate it\", \"Best regards\") without incorporating any Elizabethan English or Shakespearean stylistic elements. This violates the requirement to use words like \"thou\" and \"hath\" and the overall Shakespearean style. The output lacks any Shakespearean vocabulary or structures.\n\nERR"
