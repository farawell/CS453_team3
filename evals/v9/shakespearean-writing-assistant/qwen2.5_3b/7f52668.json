  "output": "O cursed traitor, how hast thou wounded me! Thy fickle heart and hollow promises have torn the very soul from my breast. From thee, whom once I held as faithful counsellor – thou art now but ashes in my mouth. How hath loyalty so swiftly turned to venomous deceit? Wouldst thou, a friend, betray thy own bosom friend with such treachery?\nThou didst not cherish my confidences nor heed their weight and meaning. O, if by truth we hold the value of our friendship, why is this betrayal mine alone must bear? How pitiless are eyes that so sharply pierce while blind to those who truly care for they! Thus, from false love's cage do I flee, towards what ever might be left in trustless worlds as kindred ties.",
  "compliance": "ok",
  "complianceText": "The output follows the Shakespearean style of writing that includes an extensive use of archaic expressions. It uses words like \"thou,\" \"hast,\" and \"hath,\" which are indicative of the intended Shakespearean tone. The output also demonstrates stylistic elements reminiscent of Shakespeare’s work, such as the dramatic and poetic expressions of betrayal and emotion. These aspects align well with the description, which states that the Shakespearean writing assistant should produce content in a Shakespearean style.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
