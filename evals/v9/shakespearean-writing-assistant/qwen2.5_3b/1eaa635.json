  "output": "Thou, Beatrice, hast sought to win my Father's love With gifts and tales and promises most sweet; But harken but to what I now utter, Sweetly-sounding not the echoeth with truth! Thou wert his favor'd one, by birth and by education he would've made thee monarch of this household. Alas, I crave his blessing on me too; For mine is all he seeks - in beauty, wit, and deed. His gaze upon thee doth my hopes eclipse, In every courtly gesture thou displayest. Nor wilt we pause to taste the bittersweetness Of rivalry's sour draught when love entreats! Therefore, I do beseech that in his high esteem We be reconciled, and not so far apart; For in his sight our mutual glory lies, And victory sweet, shall crown thee as it me. But should he choose to favor one above the other, Then must my soul with him no longer bow, But seek my rightful place in nature's flow, As thou wast cast beneath another star, So will I find within myself a noble part. Thus speaketh Friar Bassanio.",
