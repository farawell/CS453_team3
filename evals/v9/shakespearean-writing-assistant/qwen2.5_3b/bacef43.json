  "output": "In fairest realms where knights of valor ride,\nThey find each day anew adventure's tide.\nYet, oft within these lands of quest and might,\nLives there not too one bond sweeter than delight?\nA knight did journey forth on quests so broad\nTo earn renown and wealth of knighthood bold,\nNo blade or lance doth ever him divide,\nSave for the gentle link to his noble pride.\n\nHis steed, a dappled horse with mane as fair,\nWhose presence in his journey he sustains.\nThey live no lonely life on this new found quest,\nBut together share each challenge and each shout.\nThe steed hath felt his heart's desire so keen,\nSo does the knight's affection deepen ever more;\nFor by his side, through joy or sorrow,\nHis soul confides.\n\nThus doth a friend of bonds so pure\nWrestled like twain in lands most perilous:\nBy day with honor's crown to which they strive.\nAnd at night with trust and silence given.",
