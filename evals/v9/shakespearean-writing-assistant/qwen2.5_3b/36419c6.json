  "output": "In yesteryear, vast cities born did thrive and throb with life full-livelier than leviathan's own breath. So ran, so bustled the populace, as one might imagine men at their earliest hours unbound by care and bound instead by passion for the day.\nBut ere eons did yet pass, the city awoke to woe profound; its spirit dimmed with gloom that like a plague infected each heart and household. For in that citadel of dreams was now a veil dopt up from heaven, covering well-beloved vistas and secrets best secured by sight.\nGone were the torchlit streets where love would whisper 'night' to sweetest kisses; gone the market thronged with tradesmen bargaining for their needs. Where once men walked in bold hearts now fear lurks like a thief at twilight's hour, clutching hands about their necks and eyes ever seeketh shadows.\nThus has that once-mirrored image of life, so vivid as to pierce one's heart with wonder, been darkened; henceforth night and day have but seen the city pass in shadow, shrouded from the sun. And oft is asked: what has brought this dire change? \n'Twas said by some, that in those darkest times when the stars did not shine bright enough to light, a shadowy foe crept forth and cast his vast wings where so many were at play and loiter; ever hunting for those whom he deemeth foes against dark decree.\nThus doth the tale show, a place once bright and fair now hides within her veils and clouds of mystery, wrapped well in shadows for who knows what might dwell there unseen? Might it be that such foes of light have spread their wings from realms beyond our comprehension? In darkness they abide unknown to those most fair.",
