  "output": "In realms long past when knights did ride and wars did rage,\nThere thronged the fane where wares innumerable were placed for sale.\nHere, on pavements broad with stones of silver hue did stand\nThe master craftsmen: smiths who forge'd the gleaming sword and ploughshare too,\nAnd weavers wove with threads not dyed nor spun by hands of maid,\nBut those whose blood was sown within old wool. And also stood\nMen clad in aprons, eyes ablaze as they did pierce a basket round,\nOf fruits and nuts that grow beneath the sun from earth to see.\nHere too, the wares of merchants moved with many colors bound.\nThe vintner'd hounds doth scent his wine, and spices scented meats\nAre laid out fragrant on wrought iron trays. A baker also brings\nAn oven baked confection, or one that smells of sweet yeast air,\nWhose aroma doth proclaim the master cook's virtuous care.\nAnd in a circle 'round this vibrant hub, ye shall perceive\nThe bustling multitude from duchesses and fair ladies to\nPoor peasants who with hope did seek to add their share to thine.\nFor here their laughter rings as joyously the market hath no close,\nSave when doth dusk descend upon their merry-hearted days.",
