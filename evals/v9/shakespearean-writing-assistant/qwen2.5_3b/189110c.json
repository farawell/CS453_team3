  "output": "O bright and noble sun, that dost command the morn,\nHow quickly wilt thou from thee wane depart?\nThou mak'st thy light upon the verdant earth so clear,\nAnd all the flowers in flower and buds their colors wear.\n\nBut now as night doth come upon thy last abode,\nWith twilight's gentle hand her dusky veil she folds.\nI know a season's end doth call thee to depart,\nYet yet I hear a whisper, sweet within my heart:\nOh leave some ray of light before the darkness veils this scene,\nThat all may witness how thou dost thy sovereignty commend.\n\nHow soon shall come the stars that in their glory hold\nA wane of thine own brilliance they themselves behold?  \nAnd so it is with thee. Farewell, I bid thee now.\nThou giv'st thy last upon our sight a sign of joy,\nTo greet the setting sun beneath the lunar veil,\nObedient to that order thou by heavens' seal.\n\nSo let it be, the hour appointed for your end draweth nigh,\nBut ere you from this sphere do slip and outtake flight with shade,\nLet me not see thee cease at once in brilliancy's display,\nFor all is witness to what thou art; a masterpiece of luster laid.",
