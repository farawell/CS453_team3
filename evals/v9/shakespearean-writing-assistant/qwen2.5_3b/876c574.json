  "output": "Behold the tale as 'twixt thee and I am to rehearse: Anon, in glade where once wild flowers bloomed fair, A mortal man doth seek with heart alight The visage of Divinity who oft did light.\nIn sightless trials, wherein divine contests arise, This warrior mortals' wit doth test and try. In quest of glory, he against the god Hath bravely stood in fiery, fated mood.\nWhereon his might in deeds sublime did shine, He dared to seek where godlike immensity Doth dwell with radiance on empyrean height. The battle hewed, but not like mortals fight, This duel is wondrous; swords of spirit doth not fight.\nThe contest ended wherein he took great flight, For though the armament of gods might prove too tight, His purest heart and noble courage shone Like lighthouse on dark seas unto his foe Unfolding hope for humankind to be.",
