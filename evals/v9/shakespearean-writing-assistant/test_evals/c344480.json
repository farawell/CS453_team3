  "coverageText": "Ah, to what tempest-toss'd vessel doth my soul steer, though I be garbed in salt and brine of yon tumultuous sea? Hearken, spirits of vast unchart'd waters, lend thy ear to mine lamentation wherefore I, a wanderer of nefarious winds, shall speak of redemption.\n\nHark, thou mightiest gales, and thou silvery moon, who o'er the ocean's visage doth softly tread, dost thou not remember when mine heart was not chain'd to greed's cruel anchor? 'Tis a heavy burden I hath borne, and a tale that hath long lingered like a specter in the storm.\n\nThou dost know, fair seas, thou witness to mine misdeeds — to thee I confess, once, not long past, both hand and heart didst revel in rapine and ruthless pursuit. 'Twas I who led men of rugged visage with fire and ruthless cry ‘Pon hapless vessels, bereft their treasures to fill my coffers vast.\n\nYet now, I am haunted not by ghosts of those I hath wrong'd, but by a vision — a vision of mine own soul, stark and wretched, crying for reprieve from its own misdeeds. Canst thou sense the tremor of mine heart as it doth quake, in search of redemption ere I am lost among the oblivion's deep?\n\nO, let redemption's gentle light shine upon this tatter'd spirit, for no longer shall I sail 'neath Jove's wrath fearsome and unchecked. I pray thee, let my penitent tears turn rolling tides into tranquil streams of absolution, that I might view the morn with less shrouded eyes.\n\nHenceforth, these hands that once wrought havoc shall build, restore, and tender solace to those grieved by fate's cruel hand. Aye, I am beset upon a sea of contrition, yet I beseech the stars, let not my plea fall on barren shores. For in this heart, there lies the will to amend, to salvage what remains untarnish'd by folly.\n\nIn pilgrimage, I quest for paths untread by eager greed; to seek solace in the humblest of compassions, making recompense for those errs I once indifferently laid. Let my course be set by stars of mercy, ‘til my final voyage has run its course, and I be greeted by redemption’s embrace upon the far and hospitable shore.",
