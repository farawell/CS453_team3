  "coverageText": "O gentle youth, that fleetest swift away,  \nIn vernal bloom dost thou resplendent stand;  \nYet knoweth, like the fleeting light of day,  \nThy vibrant grace ere long shall slip from hand.  \n\nFor Time, that ancient thief, doth steal thy cheer,  \nWith gnawing tread he plucks the tender flower;  \nThough now thy visage shines so pure and clear,  \nIt must by natureâ€™s course be made to sour.  \n\nIn thine eye, a spark that sets the heavens alight,  \nThe flush of spring adorns thy cheeks so fair;  \nYet hark! The bell of age rings in the night,  \nTo mar thy bloom and write lines of care.  \n\nShall e'er the golden sun forget to rise,  \nOr silver dewdrops cease to kiss the morn?  \nNo more than these, thy youth's bright paradise  \nShall last, for Time leaves all things worn and torn.  \n\nO fleeting youth, thy sweet morsels savour,  \nFor e'en in thy prime he forges thy grave;  \nIn life's ebbing dance, thee must humanly waver,  \nUntil to the dusty bosom thou art slave.  \n\nThus let us cherish moments tender and fine,  \nEre aged Winter doth with summer twine;  \nFor once the vernal days doth draw its line,  \nEternal night claims all that fair doth shine.  ",

This is apparent through the choice of archaic words and phrases such as \"thou,\" \"dost,\" \"doth,\" \"thy,\" \"thine eye,\" \"ere,\" and \"hark,\" reminiscent of the style found in Shakespeare's work. The use of metaphorical language and the thematic exploration of time and youth further aligns with the Shakespearean style. The poem exhibits the structural beauty and rhythm found in traditional poetry, matching the description's expectation for creative content using the Shakespearean style.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
