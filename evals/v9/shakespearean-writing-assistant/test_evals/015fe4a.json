  "coverageText": "Lullaby’s Whisper\n\nI.\nO gentle moon, in splendor bright,\nTo thy soft light do I implore,\nGuard this restive soul tonight,\nTill morn's first gleam on yonder shore.\n\nII.\nHark, what breath of nightingale\nDoth sweetly hush the weary mind;\nWith melody that cannot fail,\nTo bid the world's great tumult blind.\n\nIII.\nO slumber’s balm, thou art most rare,\nThy tender arms dost cradle all,\nWrap thy shroud in silken air,\nAnd let thy soothing shadows fall.\n\nIV.\nRest, dear heart, in dreams so kind,\nWhere doth the fair and fanciful play;\nWith stars to cast their intertwin'd\nSilver beams upon thy way.\n\nV.\nClose thine eyes, and drift apace,\nAs gentle zephyrs kiss the land;\nTake thee hence to solace’s place,\nHeld by night's gentle, wistful hand.\n\nVI.\nThus may thy cares, with day's refrain,\nEclipse beneath the moonlit ray;\nTill on the morrow wakes again,\nThe gentle dawn, in gold array.\n\nVII.\nPeace be thine, till morn dost break,\nSoft be thy dreams, and sweet thy sigh,\nTill thou in joy from sleep awake,\nNeath heaven's watch, and night's soft sky.",
