  "coverageText": "In days of yore, when time did weave its threads,\nA tale doth linger 'midst the whispers fair,\nOf an heirloom most rare, whose gleaming spread\nDid lighten homes with glist’ring, hallowed air.\n\nFair was this jewel, crafted by the hand\nOf ancient artisans with skill divine;\n'Twas said a blessing from some distant land\nHad set within its heart a mystic sign.\n\nThe lineage proud, whose name adorned its grace,\nOf noble birth, in high esteem was held.\nYet fate's capricious winds did swiftly chase\nThe trinket forth, where shadows dark do dwell.\n\nLady Elsinore, with eyes of azure light,\nUpon her neck the precious gem did wear,\nBut lo, on tempest's night, ‘twas hid from sight,\nAn heirloom lost, and left the house in care.\n\nAnd thus commenced the quest to find anew\nThe gem of old, lest history fade in gloom.\nSir Cedric bold, with heart so staunch and true,\nDid vow to seek the bauble's radiant bloom.\n\nThrough forest dim and over moorland drear,\nHe traveled swift with courage in his breast,\nTill destiny beheld him drawing near\nA wizened seer, whose visage none could jest.\n\n\"Seek not the jewel on this earthly plane,\nFor it resides within thy spirit's core.\nIn thy pure heart its glimmer shall remain,\nAs love shines brighter than all gems of yore.\"\n\nThus spake the mystic, in a voice so clear,\nAnd knowledge wise did gently take its throne.\nFor the heirloom lost had ne'er departed near,\nBut lived in lore, where cherished love is sown.\n\nSo ends the tale of treasure now re-found,\nIn bonds of kin and life’s eternal ring;\nThe jewel's legacy shall e’er resound,\nAs tales of love through time immortal sing.",
