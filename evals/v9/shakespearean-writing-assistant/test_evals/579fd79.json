  "coverageText": "Enter, gentle soul, into the realm of antiquity ere bygone days, where whispers of the past do sing of fortunes told. In this realm, a tale doth wait to unfold, a tapestry woven of language venerable and rich,—inspired by the quill of the timeless bard.\n\nIn fair Verona, where we lay our scene, a noble lady, by the name Cordelia, did dwell. Her beauty was not of this earthly sphere, and her mind, a garden of wit and wisdom. Upon the turning of the year's wheel, o'er yonder hills did arrive a suitor, by name Osric, a gallant youth of fortune and verity.\n\nThe sun did rise, casting its golden lum'nous glow upon Cordelia's face as she wandered the gardens green of her father's court. 'Twas there she met with Osric, whose heart was ensnared by her radiant countenance.\n\n“Fairest Cordelia,” quoth he, “the earth lacks that which brightens yet when thou art near, for thy beauty doth outshine the sun itself. Pray, let me speak of my heart's tender plight, for 'tis a burden I can no longer bear in silence.”\n\nThus spake he with passion's flame aglow, whilst Cordelia, fair of spirit, did quiver under his earnest gaze. \n\n“Good sir,” saith she, “thy words do flutter upon mine ear like sweet songbirds that herald the bloom of spring. Speak on, for I marvel at this affection that throughout time did slumber until now it wakes.”\n\nOsric, emboldened by her gentle words, declared in earnest, “I love thee true, as the lark loves the morn, and like steadfast roots anchoring the mighty oak, my heart is drawn to thee.\"\n\nThus commenced their courtly dance, woven by fate's gentle hands, in a world spun by stardust and dreams where fair Cordelia and noble Osric gave voice to love's timeless melody, forever etched in the annals of time. So let this tale speak hence, of hearts entwined under Verona's stars. Such is the power of love, e'er enduring as the elements 'round this sphere.",
