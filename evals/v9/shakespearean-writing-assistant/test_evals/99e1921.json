  "coverageText": "In a time long forgone, o'er crests of fabled lore, there didst lie a realm enshrouded in Aeolian mist, known to none but whispers of the wind. This realm, Altheoria yclept, withal doth sleep beneath the velvet canopy of heaven, where stars do weave the dreams of ancient worlds.\n\nIn bygone days, when mortal men were as fleeting shadows 'pon the stage of earth, Altheoria did vibrate with the hum of celestial chords. Forsooth, the realm was wrought by the hands of shadowspun deities, whose magic did course through the veins of this ethereal land. Mountains there were, like titans of eld, standing sentinel o’er grove and glen. Rivers wound serpentine through vale and sward, as argent threads woven by the looms of destiny.\n\nYet one starry eve, an oath didst break; the fates did decree a turning of the tide. The goddess Lyra, she who commandeth the symphony of thine stars, did fall prey to envious machinations. A treachery profound, by her sister Astrid's hand, who longed to covet the light that Lyra's realm did cast upon the heavens.\n\nIn yon dawn's fragile glow, Astrid didst sing a melody of forgetting, and lo! The realm of Altheoria did fade from the grasp of men’s remembrance, veiled in obscurity and eternal slumber. The mighty trees thus turned to specters, and the rivers became silent streams, frozen in the world’s amnesia. \n\nYet whispers persist, carried on the zephyrs of yore, that the realm might be wakened and its glory restored, should a heart of pure intent seek its paths. For in Altheoria's heart beats the grace of dreams untainted and the promise of restoration, a haven where lost songs await the symphony of the brave-hearted’s resolve.\n\nThus the legend breathes, in the midnight hush, consecrated in starlit mystery, painting the world with the hues of forgotten imaginings—a realm sealed by time's mercurial embrace, ever patient for the hour of its destined rebirth.",
