  "coverageText": "Oh, fairest beloved, list unto mine heart's discourse,  \nFor in the tender depths of mine ardent soul,  \nDo I find a love that time doth not diminish,  \nNor tempest rend asunder. Love, steadfast and whole.  \n\nWhat tempest, what mariner's storm dost thou bring,  \nThat such love couldst bear on shiprocked seas?  \nYet, in thy presence, calmness, like a gentle spring,  \nDoth soothe the tumult of my heart's unease.  \n\nO, constant heart, in whose fervent eyes I find,  \nA mirror to my own eternal flame,  \nIn realms where age and beauty's ways be but begrimed,  \nMy love, untouched, yet ever doth remain.  \n\nKnoweth this, sweet soul, to thee I am enclined,  \nThat though the sands of time may shift and pass,  \nYet shall my love for thee, immortalized,  \nNe'er fade nor falter, but instead amass.  \n\nThus, do I vow, by all the stars that shine,  \nTo hold thee dear within my heart's embrace,  \nFor love that knows no end, is love divine,  \nAnd time shall ne’er its sacred bonds efface.  \n\nSo let this pledge of mine affection fly,  \nAs doth a lark upon the morning tide,  \nLet love endureth, never asking why,  \nYet constant 'twill remain, e'en time denied.",
