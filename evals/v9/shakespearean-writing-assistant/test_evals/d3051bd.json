  "coverageText": "Oh noble peers and gentle populace, lend me thine ears and harken unto my solemn words. As dawn doth herald the birth of a new day, so do we stand on the brink of a new reign, where hope filleth our hearts and unity shall weave its gracious tapestry.\n\nBehold, matched in glory and virtue, our sovereign ascendeth the throne, bestowed by heaven's favor and the people's will. With wisdom that doth rival Pallas Athena, and courage that neither storm nor tempest shall dare assay, our liege is destined to guide this realm with the gentle hand of a shepherd tending his flock.\n\nIn this sacred hall where history doth echo, we bear witness to the majesty which bindeth our fortunes and aspirations. May the sceptre thou wieldest be light as a feather, yet firm as the mountain's root, unshaken by the whims of fortune or the caprices of fate.\n\nAs the crown resteth upon thy noble brow, know thou art the beacon in the shadowed bay, a light for the mariners wandering the tempestuous seas. Under thy guidance, let the fields blossom and the walls of this fair kingdom stand inviolable against strife.\n\nLet peace and prosperity flourish under thy reign, as the rivers doth their courses take, and may posterity speak thy name with reverence and awe. Thus we commend unto thee, our sovereign lord, our fealty and loyalty, and pledge our service to thy cause.\n\nNow let the trumpets sound and the heavens resound in glad accord, for our noble king or queen—proud heir of the illustrious lineage—is crowned this day. Blessings and honor unto thee, our liege, now and forever more. So sayeth this humble servant of the realm.",
