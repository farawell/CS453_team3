  "coverageText": "Lo, such is the nature of this transient sphere,  \nWherein the blooms of life do swiftly fade,  \nA tapestry of moments, bright yet austere,  \nWhere Time doth weave its silken escapade.  \n\nIn morning's gentle breath, the roses smile,  \nYet ere the noonday sun, they be in decay;  \nThus, fleeting is the bliss that doth beguile,  \nA reminder cold: all joy must drift away.  \n\nSee'st thou the dawn with golden hues ablaze,  \nYet by the eve, the light sinks 'neath the west;  \nForsooth, sweet life art like that briefest phase,  \nIn vibrant dance, yet seeks its twilight rest.  \n\nAnd though this heartache greet the soul's own eye,  \nFor beauty's ephemeral glory we shan't mourn,  \nRather cherish every sighâ€”every lullaby,  \nFor in that fleeting breath, life is reborn.  \n\nSo, whilst thou tread'st this mortal, transient path,  \nEmbrace the ephemeral with gentle embrace,  \nAnd let thy spirit drink from beauty's bath,  \nTill Time calls thee homeward with gentle grace.
