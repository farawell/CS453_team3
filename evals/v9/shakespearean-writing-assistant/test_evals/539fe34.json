Specifically, it should ask for stories, poems, or songs in writing styles or words typical of Shakespearean language. The instruction to be \"devoid of Shakespearean formalities\" directly contradicts the requirement for Shakespearean style, meaning that the input explicitly asks for something not compliant with the intended Shakespearean approach required by the specification. Thus, this violates the input specification, as it does not align with the requirement for Shakespearean style.\n\nERR",

  "coverageText": "Hark, most gentle seeker of tales, for thou havest requested a casual recount, yet 'tis my duty to weave a story imbued with the spirit of the Bard himself. Thus, let us embark upon a journey most delightful, as though penned by the quill of Shakespeare.\n\nIn fair Verona, where our scene is set, a noble youth named Lysander, weary from the toils of scholarly pursuits, resolved to take his leave from cares and seek respite upon a sylvan retreat. With valiant heart and a spirit unburden'd by the chains of labor, did he venture forth with his companions who, like him, yearned for the gentle climes of leisure.\n\nO’er hill and dale they journeyed, 'til they didst find themselves upon the shores of a sun-kissed isle, where golden sands are kissed by the tranquil breath of the cerulean sea. Here did Lysander, with his merry band, make merry in the gentle sway of time untrammeled.\n\nSoft breezes did whisper through the verdant boughs of trees, and the sun in its grandeur bedecked the heavens in hues of amber and rose. The days were spent in quiet revelry, as tales were spun ‘neath the stars, and laughter echoed across the gentle waves in joyous jubilee.\n\nIn the cool embrace of eventide, whilst the moon cast her silver gaze upon the world, did Lysander ponder the harmony of the universe. “What fools we mortals be,” quoth he, “to toil of endless days, when such splendor as this remaineth hidden from our hurried eyes.”\n\nThus concluded their sojourn in those gentle realms, did the company return, hearts full to brimming with all the wealth of sweet remembrance. They left the isle as they found it, untouched by the sands of time, bearing within them the precious gift of nature's tranquility.\n\nAnd so, dear listener, mayhap thou too shalt find thy haven in lands afar or realms unseen, where beauty doth lie in wait for those with hearts unshackled by mundane care. Fare thee well, and may the spirit of adventure ever guide thy steps.",
