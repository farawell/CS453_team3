  "coverageText": "**Enter ALASDAIR and LYNETTE, two lords discussing the nature of war.**\n\n**ALASDAIR:**  \nMethinks this harsh and turbulent tempest dost sear the soul,\nAs brave men do fall upon the sward, their fate unknown,\nWhilst kings and generals plot with bitter coldness\nThe ruinous dance of swords and steeds in grim array. \nWhat purpose dost this conflict serve, when dust is dust,\nAnd mortal men do naught but hasten to their icy grave?\n\n**LYNETTE:**  \nAye, good Alasdair, thou speak'st with wisdom rare,\nFor in this ceaseless strife, we find our folly bare.\nCrowning ambition doth mock our human flesh,\nAnd sovereigns' greed maketh none but hollow kings.\nLo, the very ground that drinks our blood cries out,\nWhile we, but shadows of the earth, see naught but grief.\n\n**ALASDAIR:**  \nYet, doth not the bell of war resound in every ear?\nThis bane of mortal coil hath drawn too close alas,\nAnd when the dawn doth break on crimson fields,\nThe earth herself doth sorrow in silent witness.\nFor what is victory if the price is endless woe,\nAnd peace itself a dream that wax and wane, ever bereft?\n\n**LYNETTE:**  \nTrue, dear friend, that we in folly's quest do err,\nIn vain pursuit of glories that fade into air.\nLet us beseech the heavens, thus, for wisdom’s light,\nThat we may the error of our ways discern aright.\nWhence comes this bane, if not from hearts encased in stone?\nBy love's grace may we break the cycle, and thus redeem our own.\n\n**ALASDAIR:**  \nLet thy words be a balm to the hearts of men,\nThat mercy and concord may yet regain their reign.\nFor in this transient life, naught is more dear than peace—\nMay the ploughshare end this tumult, and let arms cease!\n\n**LYNETTE:**  \nSo shall we strive with hope renewed, dost thou agree?\nThat in the time to come, our hearts shall war no more.\nUntil such peace resides 'mongst all, both low and high, \nWe shall, thus resolved, together labour, you and I.\n\n**Exeunt.**",
