  "coverageText": "By the silvered glow of Luna's watchful gaze, partake I in a tale spun of gossamer threads, where shadows dance in merry rounds and whispers take flight upon the zephyr’s wing. Hark, gentle guise of dreams, where beneath yon copse, secrets do dwell in slumber’s quiet court, and the capricious pulse of time doth wear a veiled countenance.\n\nLo, as the sun doth unto hidden realms retreat, leaving naught but ethereal twilight’s embrace, a specter weaves its path ‘mongst the umbrageous boughs with steps cloaked in velvet night. \"Pray tell,\" quoth the chirping crickets ere they cease their carol, leaving naught but the heartbeat of yon slumbering earth.\n\n‘Tis verily a ballad written by fate’s sly hand, spun with threads unseen by mortal ken, where every glance and nod is known, yet lost within a labyrinth of deceits fair. Aye, to seek the truth is to chase shadows 'pon moonlit paths, where certainty is oft a mirage, and answers dance just beyond the outstretched grasp.\n\nThus revealed, the tale is, yet not; unfurls like a rose unto fragrant mysteries, betokening promises crafted of cloud and stardust, hinting upon realms both near and afar, whence art lies the heart, pondering yet silent as the deep-sleeping world whispers unto its dreamers. So ye, dear interlocutor, must infer or wander; this realm is thine, where clarity is but the jest of time-steeped spirits who delight in riddles spun of moonlight.",
