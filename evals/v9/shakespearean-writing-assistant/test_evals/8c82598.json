  "coverageText": "In a realm where time dost trod its weary pace, there lived two creatures of such disparate form—a tortoise wise and a hare sprightly, whose bounds did part the very zephyrs in twain. The sun, in its golden journey across the firmament, gazed down upon their rivalry, anon to be resolved by a wager brave.\n\n\"O thou gentle tortoise,\" quoth the hare, gaily skipping upon the dewy blades, \"dost thou dare to match thy sluggish gait against mine fleet-footed course?\"\n\nThe tortoise, with eyes like pearls of wisdom submerged in an ocean of calm, did nod. \"In truth,\" he replied, \"thy swiftness is a wondrous thing, yet I beseech thee, haste not to scorn the virtues of patience. For in constancy, slow though it be, doth often find the prize.\"\n\nAnd so, with terms agreed, they set forth upon a path through verdant glades and shadowed copse, where fauna played and flora blushed beneath the sun's warm kiss. The hare, confident as the morning sun, leapt and bound far ahead, whilst the tortoise with measured plod traversed the ground.\n\nYet upon his heedless way, the hare, in his pride and folly, beheld a meadow lush where gentle breezes did lull to rest. There, he lay his head upon the emerald bed, whispering to himself, \"I shall yet rise ere yon tortoise seizes victory.\"\n\nThe tortoise, meanwhile, unyielding in his steadfast march, pressed on through the day's dimming light, his spirit undeterred by the shadows lengthening in the west. He did not hasten, nor did he tarry; his journey a testament to fortitude and resolve.\n\nThe creatures of the wood gathered 'round, witness to a tale oft told anew, where pride doth stumble and patience prevaileth. For when the sun sank low beyond the horizon's edge, it was the tortoise who crossed the line with calm demeanor, while the hare woke to find his dreams had turned to naught but chimeras.\n\nThus endeth the tale, with a lesson as old as time itself: that patience, dear and virtuous, above all things secureth the soul's true course, leading one unto victory most serene.\n\nThe moral of the fable, my lord and lady dear, is none other than this—doubt not the gentle pace of patience, for its gait, steady and unwavering, shall ever triumph o'er the hasty folly that dwelleth in the hearts of those who seek swift gain.",
  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output does indeed mirror the Shakespearean style as described. It includes words and phrases typical of Shakespearean English, such as \"dost,\" \"thou,\" \"ere,\" \"anon,\" \"quoth,\" \"thee,\" \"hath,\" and terms of poetic flourish like \"zephyrs,\" \"firmament,\" \"verdant glades,\" and \"chimeras.\" The narrative is lyrical and infused with a formal, archaic structure aligning with the Shakespearean mode of storytelling.\n\nThe structure is thoughtfully crafted, enveloping a classic moral lesson of patience versus hubris through the tale of the tortoise and the hare, portraying characters in a manner that echoes the drama and grandeur of Shakespeare's work. The text clearly demonstrates adherence to the description's requirement for Shakespearean style without input-specific deviations. \n\nNo violation.\nOK",
