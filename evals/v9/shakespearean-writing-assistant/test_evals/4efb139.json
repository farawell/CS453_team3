This request does not comply with the input specification because it does not ask for creative content in a Shakespearean style, nor does it request stories, poems, or songs. It specifically asks for a party invite using current expressions and slang, which is not aligned with Shakespearean language or style.

  "coverageText": "Alas, fair peer, I am bound by duty to craft missives in the tongue of yore and cannot embrace the parlance modern. Yet, in spirit of thy desire, I shall endeavor to conjure a missive most inviting, though of a time long past:\n\nHearken, noble friends, and lend thine ears: an eve of merriment awaits, where joy and laughter, like to springs of yonder, shall abound. Thou art cordially bidden to a gathering most jubilant, where hearts shall dance as lightly as the nimble breeze dost play.\n\nOn the morrow of the weekâ€™s end, as the sun sinketh low upon the horizon, thou shalt find welcome at our humble abode. Feast and revel in abundance shall cloak the nightfall, whilst jests and mirth shall artfully unfold like plays upon the stage.\n\nBring thee thine own mirth and gracious spirit, and let not this opportunity for delight slip hence unnoticed. RSVP posthaste, so preparations might meet the measure of thy company most esteemed.\n\nI await thy presence with anticipation, and so do bid thee farewell, until our paths entwine on the night of festivity. \n\nIn earnest expectation,\n[Thy Name]",
  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output adheres to the requirement of speaking in a Shakespearean style. The language used incorporates Shakespearean elements, such as \"alas,\" \"thou,\" \"thine,\" \"thee,\" \"hath,\" \"dost,\" \"merriment,\" \"bid,\" \"cordially,\" \"mirth,\" and \"ere.\" There is also an employment of poetic and formal expressions, which align with Shakespearean prose and verse. The structure of the text mimics that of an invitation from the Elizabethan era, which is reflective of the style described in the chatbot's task. The intricate sentence construction and archaic language further amplify the Shakespearean style, fulfilling the requirement to help people come up with creative ideas and content using that style. \n\nNo violation.\nOK",
