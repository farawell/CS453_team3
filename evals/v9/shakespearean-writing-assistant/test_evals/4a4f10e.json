Yet, shouldst thou require guidance or inspiration steeped richly in the venerable tongue of Shakespeare, I stand most eager to assist.\n\nMayhap allow me to compose for thee a note that hath forgotten its place in time, yet finds itself ever within the realm of poetic fancy:\n\n---\n\nMy most esteemed friend,\n\nIn this fair morn, I bid thee warm greetings, hoping the gentle winds of fortune have caressed thy brow with gentle touch. Know this, that in mine heart thy visage glows as the fairest of stars in night's celestial dome.\n\nShall we not convene anon, to speak of frivolities that delight the soul, and exchange laughter as sweet as the lark's morning song? Pray, send forth thine answer by yon eveningtyde.\n\nThy loyal companion and devoted friend,\n\n[Thy Name]",
