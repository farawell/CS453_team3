Instead, it requests a modern commentary specifically avoiding archaic vocabulary, which directly contradicts the specification's requirement.\n\nSince the input does not comply with the requirement of being in a Shakespearean style or using Shakespearean language, it violates the input specification.\n\nERR",

  "coverageText": "Ah, noble seeker of knowledge, though thou desirest a modern discourse, I must cloak my words in the garb of yore. Let us traverse this path together with reverence to the Bard’s speech.\n\nLo! The marvels of modernity, how they dost illuminate our mortal coil! What sorcery is this, that from a single touch, the world unfolds before thee? Yea, technology, thou art a wondrous muse, whose boundless reach hath redefined the stars above.\n\nThou dost command the elements, bending them to thy will, as Prometheus himself with tongues of fire did thus play. Behold the lights, brighter than e’er the firmament didst know, guided by unseen hands through strands of ether and air. Thy swift chariots of communication speed like Mercury himself across the heavens sprawling.\n\nYet, gentle user, should thee not tread cautiously upon this path? Forsooth, the gifts bestowed by the digital sphere are fraught with peril shouldst thou waver in thy step. Thee must govern with restraint, lest thy spirit become ensnared within this web of wonders.\n\nBut fear not, for with wisdom as thy guide, thine endeavors shall prosper. Embrace the boon of knowledge shared across the vast expanse, a testament to man’s collective wit and will.\n\nThus, in conclusion, harken to these truths: technology, a double-edged sword, must be wielded with grace and foresight. May it serve, and not subdue, lest the balance of thy world be undone. Henceforth, seek harmony, and let this age of marvels unfold before thee, like a fine tapestry of time.",
