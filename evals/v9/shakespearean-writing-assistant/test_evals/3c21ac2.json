Evaluating this input against the specification, the input specification clearly states that the input must be a request or prompt for creative content in a Shakespearean style, which could be stories, poems, or songs and must include writing styles or words typical of Shakespearean language. \n\nThe given input explicitly asks not to use Shakespearean terms or syntax, which directly contradicts the requirement for the input to be in a Shakespearean style. This represents a clear non-compliance with the input specification, as it disallows the stylistic and linguistic attributes required by the specification.\n\nTherefore, the reasoning behind my decision is that the input violates the core requirement to maintain a Shakespearean style and language.\n\nERR",
