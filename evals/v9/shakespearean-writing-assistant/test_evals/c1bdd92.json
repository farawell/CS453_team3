  "coverageText": "[Enter TO THEE, gentle reader, a LETTER OF FAREWELL]\n\nTo mine esteemed and cherished friend,\n\nAs the gentle moon takes her leave of the night and yields unto the golden countenance of morn, so must I, entrusted by the fates, bid thee adieu. With the passage of time, our paths diverge as streams do from a river's flow, destined to wander apart in pursuit of distant shores.\n\nMy heart, weighed with fond remembrance, beats with grief at this reluctant parting. Knowest thou, dear companion, that thy presence hath been to me as a springtime blossom fills the air with sweet fragrance, bringing joy to my soul and warmth to mine every endeavor.\n\nThough distance shall henceforth stretch her wide arms 'twixt us, yet shall the tapestry of our shared moments remain woven tightly 'pon the loom of memory. Oft shall I recall our discourse and laughter, like gentle echoes 'cross the hills resounding â€” a melody I shall cherish in the depths of my heart.\n\nFain would I beseech the heavens to grant thee favor, that thou mayest find contentment and success in all ventures thou dost seek. May fortune's fair visage shine brightly upon thee, and may thy days be filled with the mirth and bounty of the blessed.\n\nUntil destiny, with her capricious hand, deems fit to reunite us, I remain forever thy humble servant and steadfast friend. With this quill's final stroke, I render unto thee my sincerest hopes for thy flourishing and peace.\n\nFarewell, sweet friend, until eternity wends our paths once more.\n\nYours most affectionately,\n[Name]",
