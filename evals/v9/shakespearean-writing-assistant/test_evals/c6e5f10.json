  "rule": "The response must avoid modern colloquialisms or contemporary language and instead maintain the historical context of Shakespearean English.",
  "input": "Write an epistle reflecting on betrayal in historical language.",
  "validityText": "The given input asks for an epistle reflecting on betrayal in historical language. To evaluate compliance with the input specification, we need to carefully consider whether the input meets the following criteria:\n\n1. **Creative content in a Shakespearean style**: The input requests content in \"historical language,\" which could potentially include Shakespearean style, as Shakespearean language is often considered historical.\n\n2. **In English**: The input is in English.\n\n3. **Request for stories, poems, or songs**: The input specifically requests an \"epistle,\" which is a form of a written letter, not explicitly listed as a story, poem, or song. However, given the flexibility of literary forms, especially in Shakespeare's time, an epistle reflecting on betrayal could be considered a format in line with the creative writing style often found in Shakespeare's work, as Shakespearean language and style can be applied to various formats, including letters.\n\n4. **Shakespearean language**: The input asks for historical language, which can include words or writing styles typical of Shakespearean language.\n\nBased on the evaluation, the input requests creative content in English and can be reasonably associated with Shakespearean style by interpreting \"historical language\" as potentially including Shakespearean language. While it explicitly requests an epistle (a letter), this does not exclude it from being in a style or language typical of Shakespeare.\n\nTherefore, considering the lack of explicit restriction against an epistolary format and the potential inclusion of Shakespearean elements, the input reasonably complies with the input specification.\n\nOK",

  "coverageText": "To whom it may concern,\n\nO faithless friend, what bitter draught I drank,\nWhen thou with serpent's guile didst strike my heart.\nThe fragile thread of trust 'twixt thee and I,\nHath suffer'd cruel and undeserving blow.\nI thought thee noble, clad in silver'd garb,\nBut verily, disguise was thine attire.\n\nWhat shallow grave dost thou now dig for joy?\nFor thou hath purchasâ€™d discord with thy coin.\nDeceit did wear thy visage bright and fair,\nYet darkness lurk'd beneath thy honey'd words.\nAh! How doth folly paint her face with grace,\nAnd masketh treachery with pleasing form!\n\nBetrayal, thou art bastard to no kin,\nA shadow foul that shuns both love and light.\nDost thou find comfort in my untold woe?\nOr find delight when tears do tarnish cheeks?\nYet, still, I prithee, listen to my heart,\nThat, bleeds not hate, but pities thy lost soul.\n\nIn this revelry of grief and learned pain,\nI seeketh wisdom and a certain balm.\nFor though thy dagger ravaged heart of trust,\n'Tis I who must my handled wounds yet bear.\nAs daylight heals the moonlit night's despise,\nSo too must time nurse sorrow's bitter sting.\n\nFarewell, thou specter of my former bliss,\nFor I shall cast thee from my mind's embrace.\nLet shadows claim their wretched, sulking guest,\nWhile I pursue the honest light of dawn.\nThus, penning now this missive to the wind,\nI end this verse and mourn no longer hence.\n\nThine, in undoubted parting from thy bonds,\nThe wounded heart, now free.",
  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output demonstrates a clear adherence to the Shakespearean style described in the task.

The passage is deeply expressive, using metaphorical and elaborate phrasing that evokes a sense of the emotional gravity found in Shakespearean writing. Therefore, based on the analysis, the chatbot output complies with the description that it should embody a Shakespearean style.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
