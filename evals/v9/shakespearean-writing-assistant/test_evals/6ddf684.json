  "coverageText": "Ay, woe betide the heart that withers fast   \nIn coils of bitter rue, where shadows cast—  \nA soul entrapped by time’s relentless breath,  \nHath sorrow traced upon this brow, ’tis death.  \n\nWhat folly mine, to tread along yon path,  \nWhere fate’s cruel jest unmasked its wrath.  \nMethinks the hours lost, like sand through glass,  \nIn search of dreams too fleet, too soon to pass.  \n\nO conscience, art thou specter of my night?  \nThou bring’st the past with burdened wings alight.  \nEach choice a dagger sharp, doth pierce my breast,  \nYet cannot slake the thirst for hopeful rest.  \n\nWhat deeds undone doth round upon the stage  \nAnd clamor loud with ever-righteous rage?  \nOft have I turned and sought with tearful eye  \nThe moments fled, and asked for reason why.  \n\nO muse of respite, grant thy voice to me,  \nTo silence echoes of my heart’s decree,  \nLet yonder morn bring solace to my soul,  \nAnd cast anew my fate in light’s control.  \n\nFor, in this breath, I ponder deeply still,  \nIf by regret’s hand, I might learn free will—  \nTo stave my grief, to mend this weary heart,  \nBefore the curtain falls and we must part.  \n\nThus do I stand, alone amidst the night,  \nAnd yearn for dawn to quell its endless fright.  \nYet here remains imprisoned, 'neath the stars,  \nMy soul entwined, regret its cruelest bars.
