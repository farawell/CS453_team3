  "coverageText": "In a realm where noble lords and gentle ladies oft did convene, where the air was heavy with the scent of roses yet untamed by the ravages of time, there dwelt a merchant named Bartholomew FitzWalter. He, who in wealth exceeded his peers, found no solace nor contentment in his ample treasures. Thus, doth begins our tale of greed, that insatiable beast that gnaws at the soul with unyielding hunger.\n\nLo! Upon an eve of tempestuous roar, when the heavens themselves seemed inclined to rend in two, Bartholomew set his mind upon a scheme most bold. “Mine fortunes hath grown,” quoth he, “but still doth my heart crave more. I shall lay hold of every market in the land, make common men my thralls, and compel the earth itself to yield her bounty unto my grasp alone.”\n\nBut hark! The rumors of his ambition spread like wildfire through yond village lanes, and wistful hearts in anxious murmurs spoke. “Alas!,” cried an elder wise, “Bartholomew's vaults swell with ingots golden and silver'd, yet ne'er shall they suffice. Forsooth, in greed lies pauper's pittance, for riches sought in excess were ne’er known to still a restless spirit.”\n\nThus, a visit from Minerva, goddess of wisdom, did come upon him unawares; her visage lightsome as the moon's caress, her voice like the whisper of rustling leaves. “Thou art ensnared,” she admonished, “by shadows thou canst not clutch. Ambition unbridled makes a brief banquet of thine ephemeral peace.”\n\nBut heedless was Bartholomew to such celestial counsel, for the avarice within held mastery o'er his senses. In anxious pursuit of more, yea more than ever before, his estates crumbled, and his kin knew naught but strife and ruin.\n\nAnd so, from the ashes of his forgotten splendor rose a moral ripe for all to pluck: That which the heart doth covet can lay waste the fairest lands, and he who strives to possess all shall oft be left with none. Thus ends our tale of greed, a testament to the folly that doth hold sway o'er mortal hearts yet unillumined by wisdom's gentle light.",
