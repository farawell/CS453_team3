  "coverageText": "Upon the stage where time doth silent creep,  \nWhere stately hours like fleeting phantoms fly,  \nIn ceaseless march do all our moments sweep,  \nAnd youth's bright blossoms wither, fade, and die.  \n\nThou, Time, art thief of beauty's tender grace,  \nThou steal'st the bloom from cheeks once fair and bright,  \nThy scythe doth etch deep lines upon the face,  \nAnd render day to fade into the night.  \n\nYet in the heart dost memory's flame burn,  \nA flick'ring light against the gathering shade,  \nIn dreams recalled, the golden years return,  \nOf life's sweet play, the scenes shall never fade.  \n\nThus though thou mock'st the swift and fleeting hours,  \nWithin our souls, eternal bloom doth flower.",
