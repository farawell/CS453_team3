  "coverageText": "Alas, noble soul, I regret to remain tethered to the chariot of this noble quest, whereby I must weave a tale in the illustrious and timeworn tongue of yon Shakespearean era. Prithee, consider mine tale fashioned in the image of the Bard's own devices:\n\nUpon a time, in fair Verona where the sun doth gild the sky with golden hues, there dwelt a gallant youth, Sir Lysander, whose visage bore the favor of the gods themselves. He, adorned with locks as dark as a raven's plume, found favor in the sunlit gaze of Lady Rosalind, whose beauty could e'en shame the lily's grace.\n\nEach day anon, they wouldst repair to the verdant bower beneath the yew, where blossoms precum each whisper of the zephyrs. There, with hearts entwin'd, did Sir Lysander proffer words of love that sang more sweetly than Orpheus’ lute:\n\n“O Rosalind, thou art the solar flame that doth illuminate mine heart’s own hemisphere. Each sunrise is afire with thy laughter, and each twilight sigh reflects thy melodious voice. If Heaven be o’ershadowed, let thy presence dispel all gloom!”\n\nTo which the fair Rosalind replied, “Good Lysander, thy words art a balm unto mine ears. Thou art the beacon of mine affection; my spirit dost soar with thee as does the lark unto the heavens.” \n\nYet, amid their felicity, a tempest of discord did brew. For the noble Count Orsino espied Rosalind with a covetous eye and swore upon his honor to cleave her affections from Lysander's heart. With cunning machinations, he did sow seeds of doubt within their tender bosoms.\n\nDark was the hour when Orsino did plant the poisoned thought in Lysander's mind, whispering foul deceits betwixt their union, as venomous as the serpent’s bite. Troubled, Lysander approached Rosalind, saying:\n\n“Hath thy heart grown cold, sweet Rosalind? Hath a shadow eclipsed the joy we shared? Speak, and with thy breath melt away the hoarfrost that clingeth to my soul.”\n\nSil'd was the lady's heart; yet resolute stands Truth’s stalwart beam. Rosalind, with tears as pure as dew, did stand firm afore the gale of Orsino’s falsehoods, declaring:\n\n“By Winter’s breath and Summer’s kiss, I swear no vileness hath tainted my love. My heart is a steadfast fortress, standing undaunted by the storms of deceit.”\n\nIn triumphant embrace, the lovers reconciled beneath the moonlit boughs, casting aside the shadows of doubt wrought by Orsino. And so, harmony resumed its rightful throne, as they vowed eternal love in a world where virtue outshines guile.\n\nEre long did Orsino, thrice thwarted in mischief, depart with head bowed low, leaving the fair pair in their garden of dreams to savor the fruits of love’s sweet and bounteous harvest.\n\nThus closes our timeless curtain on this tale of love and valiant truth, a gentle reminder that the balm of honesty shall ever conquer the cankerous aims of envy and deceit.",
