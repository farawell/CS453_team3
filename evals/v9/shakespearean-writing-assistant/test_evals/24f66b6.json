  "coverageText": "Pardon me, good sir or madam, yet must I strive to mold thy request into a form most befitting the wondrous world of the Bard. Hark to the following counsel, as offered in a fashion that doth pay homage to the great playwright himself:\n\n1. To thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man.\n\n2. Speakest thou little, and listen much, for wisdom oft cometh through the biding of wise silence.\n\n3. Lay not that flattering unction to thy soul, that fortune shall always smile upon thee. Prepare, instead, for tempests that may visit.\n\n4. Love all, trust a few, and do wrong to none, so shalt thou dwell in peace and accord with the world.\n\n5. Apparel oft proclaims the man, thus array thyself in raiments that mirror the purity and intent of thy spirit.\n\n6. Doubt thou the stars are fire; doubt that the sun doth move; doubt truth to be a liar, but never doubt I love.\n\n7. Keep thy friends close and dear, yet knowest well the face of thine own shadowed foe.\n\n8. Beware the ides of unbridled ambition, for 'tis a faithful servant, but a treacherous master.\n\n9. Seek not to grasp the fleeting moment; instead, treasure the vast expanse of memory's enduring realm.\n\n10. When in discourse, let thy words be sweet as honey, for yet another day may merge anew with bitter gall.\n\nOf these tenets of wisdom, I pray thou find a flicker of enlightenment and a morsel of grace.",
  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output demonstrates a commitment to Shakespearean style. The use of archaic words and phrases such as \"thou,\" \"thine,\" \"doth,\" \"hark,\" and \"beseech\" contributes to this style. Furthermore, the content is presented as a series of philosophical and reflective statements, reminiscent of the moral and ethical themes often explored in Shakespeare's plays. The grammatical style and sentence structure also appear to follow the formal style consistent with past centuries, similar to what might be found in Shakespearean literature. Overall, each element combines effectively to pay homage to the Bard. Thus, there are no violations of the description requirements.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
