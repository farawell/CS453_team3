  "coverageText": "Oh, wondrous Nature, thou art fair and bright,  \nIn thee doth bloom a grace beyond compare.  \nThy verdant garments flourish in daylight,  \nAnd gentle winds thy fragrant incense bear.  \n\nThe sky, a sapphire dome, doth span o'erhead,  \nAdorned with clouds in scrolls of azure hue.  \nThe sun, a fiery orb, o'er all doth shed  \nIts golden rays, igniting dawn anew.  \n\nFair blossoms rise beneath each tender leaf,  \nTheir colors vivid as Apollo's crown.  \nThe babbling brooks, in tune with time's brief grief,  \nSing gentle hymns to calm the world's renown.  \n\nThou cradle life and secrets yet untold,  \nIn shadowed valleys and on lofty peaks.  \nThy mystic ways in beauty will unfold,  \nOf thee, the soul of every poet speaks.  \n\nOh, Nature, queen of heaven and of earth,  \nWithin thy bosom all thy wonders lie.  \nAnd we, mere mortals, honor thy great worth,  \nFor in thy grace our hearts eternally shall fly.",
