  "validityText": "The given input, \"Draft a mysterious song avoiding direct clarity in language,\" requests a song to be written using language that is not directly clear. Evaluating this against the input specification:\n\n1. **Language**: The request is in English, which complies with the specification.\n\n2. **Creative Content**: The input asks for a song, which falls within the permissible categories of stories, poems, or songs as outlined in the specification.\n\n3. **Shakespearean Style**: The specification requires that the content is in a Shakespearean style, either through writing style or words typical of Shakespearean language. The provided input does not specifically mention or imply any Shakespearean style, language, or elements typical of Shakespeare's works. It merely requests a song with mysterious language without a reference to Shakespeare.\n\nBased on these points, the input does not comply with the requirement to ask for creative content in a Shakespearean style. This is the key violation, as the request does not clearly connect to any aspect specific to Shakespeare's work or style.\n\nERR",

  "coverageText": "(Verse 1)\nOft when the moon doth o’er the horizon creep,  \nIn shadows' shroud, doth secrets softly weep.  \nA whisper’d wail borne on the zephyr's flight,  \nBetwixt the veil of day and darkest night.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nWhat art these echoes by the river’s side?  \nIn cloisters dim, where phantoms yet abide.  \nUnseen, unheard, save by the midnight's call,  \nMurmurings faint where spectral curtains fall.  \n\n(Verse 2)  \nIn yonder grove where time doth cease to tread,  \nLies hidden lore within the wind's soft dread.  \nA murmurous tale of joy and woe entwined,  \nBeneath the watch of heaven's starry bind.  \n\n(Bridge)  \nWith cloudy guise the orioles sing anew,  \nIn riddles spun by leaves of silver dew.  \nYet ne'er the truth within the folds doth lie,  \nFor shadows dance in absence of the eye.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nWhat art these echoes by the river’s side?  \nIn cloisters dim, where phantoms yet abide.  \nUnseen, unheard, save by the midnight's call,  \nMurmurings faint where spectral curtains fall.  \n\n(Outro)  \nThus wilt thou wander 'neath the silent skies,  \nWith heart afire yet blinded to disguise.  \nO seek not answers, for they stayeth hidden,  \nIn murk of night where whispers are forbidden.",
  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot's output adheres to the Shakespearean style that it's described to emulate. The language style throughout the song is consistent with a Shakespearean voice, incorporating words such as \"thou,\" \"doth,\" \"wilt,\" \"ne'er,\" \"betwixt,\" and \"art,\" which match the lexical markers from the description. Furthermore, the structure and rhyme patterns resemble the poetic form often associated with Shakespearean literature, and the imagery is in line with themes and styles found in Shakespearean works. \n\nThere is no violation of the guidelines as the output maintains the required Shakespearean style, making direct and explicit use of this language consistently through the verses, chorus, bridge, and outro. Thus, the chatbot output is compliant with the provided description.\n\nNo violation.\nOK",
