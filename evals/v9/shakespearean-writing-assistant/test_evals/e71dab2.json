  "coverageText": "O list to my ballad, fair lords and fair dames,  \nOf treachery’s whisper that seizes the heart,  \nWhen trust like a phantom doth vanish in flames,  \nAnd bonds once entwined art with guile torn apart.  \n\nWithin the night's shadow lurketh deceit,  \nWhere once gentle vows did in moonlight sound fair.  \nA serpent in guise, with thy charms so discreet,  \nHath woven thy venom with foulness to snare.  \n\nThe tale proceedeth of comrades so sworn,  \nTheir kinship as mighty as ships that do sail,  \nYet Fate in her mirth laugh’d and planted the thorn,  \nThat sundered these brethren whose love did prevail.  \n\nO, treachery’s visage doth smile with glee,  \nAs trust from her perch plummets down to her doom,  \nIn loyal hearts maketh a grim chamber free,  \nWhere sorrow and anguish together find room.  \n\nA dagger unseen, how it pierceth the soul,  \nThe grasp of betrayal, so chilling and cold.  \nOnce fervent affection, now taketh its toll,  \nIn mournful refrain, doth this tragic lay hold.  \n\nBut hark! In the wake of such grievous descent,  \nLet not thine own spirit in misery dwell.  \nEmpower the morn with a heart yet unbent,  \nFor justice shall heed thine affliction as well.  \n\nThus ends this sad ballad of treacherous woe,  \nA caution to all who in earnestness tread,  \nFor falsehoods like shadows unfurl like the crow,  \nIn flight seeking hearts that are trusting and dead.
