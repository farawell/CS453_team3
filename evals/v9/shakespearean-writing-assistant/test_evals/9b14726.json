  "coverageText": "(Verse 1)\nIn shadows cast by time's relentless hand,  \nDoth memory weave its subtle, soft embrace.  \nO fleeting hours, dost thou not understand,  \nHow sweet remembrance masks thy fleeting pace?  \nWithin the heart, past echoes softly sing,  \nOf days once bright, now dimmed by evening's wing.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nO time, thou tyrant, with thy ceaseless flow,  \nDost thou not see the tears thou causeth here?  \nYet in thy course, doth sacred moments glow,  \nIn memory's keep, where all is held most dear.  \n\n(Verse 2)  \nThou art a river, wild and free to roam,  \nWith naught to bind thee, nor thy rollicking waves.  \nThy current sweeps the footfalls far from home,  \nYet in thy depth, bright memory bravely braves.  \nReturns the light of ages long since passed,  \nIn shimmers bright where shadows erst were cast.  \n\n(Bridge)  \nIf time be foe, then memory the knight,  \nOft wielding joy against the creeping night.  \nAnd though the sands hast ever slipped away,  \nIn memory's gentle clutch must moments stay.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nO time, thou tyrant, with thy ceaseless flow,  \nDost thou not see the tears thou causeth here?  \nYet in thy course, doth sacred moments glow,  \nIn memory's keep, where all is held most dear.  \n\n(Outro)  \nSo sing we of the love forgotten not,  \nIn memory's tender realm, ne'er to rot.  \nThough time may claim the present from our hand,  \nIn echoes sweet, our past shall ever stand.",
