  "coverageText": "Oh, heart that once didst revel in the mirth\nOf fellowship most pure and unalloyed,\nWhere art thou fled, sweet bond of sacred worth,\nBy sorrow's cruel hand, so cold, destroyed?\n\nForlorn am I, bereft of gentle kin,\nWhose laughter once did echo in mine ear.\nLike fleeting shadows on yon verdant lin,\nDeparted is thy presence, bright and dear.\n\nO thou, fair companion of yesteryear,\nWhat tempest's breath hath torn thy spirit hence?\nWhat dire misfortune brought thee absence near,\nWhen erstwhile thou wert mine confidence?\n\nThe sun doth rise with heavy heart and weeps,\nThe moon, unmoved by time, doth mock my sighs.\nIn solitude, my soul its vigil keeps,\nWhilst fondest mem'ries fleetingly arise.\n\nWould that I could reverse the cruel tide,\nAnd mend the chasm betwixt thee and me.\nYet here I stand, with naught to grant me guide,\nSave for the echo of what used to be.\n\nFarewell, sweet friendship, jewel lost to time,\nThy loss to me more bitter than the gall.\nI bear thy memory in solemn rhyme,\nUntil, perchance, we meet 'neath heaven's thrall.",
