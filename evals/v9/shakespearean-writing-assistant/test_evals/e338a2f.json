  "coverageText": "(Verse 1)\nO fairest love, that once didst bloom so bright,  \nThy tender grace, as gentle as the morn,  \nHath left mine heart in shadowed woe of night,  \nForlorn am I, as one who hath been shorn.  \nThou wast the sun that warmed mine every day,  \nYet now art fled, o'er distant hills away.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nO heart, thou break'st beneath love's cruel sting,  \nFor in loss's wake, no solace doth it bring,  \nIn dreams alone thy visage comes in view,  \nYet waking, I bemoan what love didst undo.  \n\n(Verse 2)  \nUpon the winds doth whisper thine own name,  \nA balm so sweet, yet cutteth like a sword,  \nEach memory fonder than a fleeting flame,  \nBrings anguish of the past thus oft ignored.  \nHow cruel fate weaves a web where love hast flown,  \nLeaving but echoes where affection shone.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nO heart, thou break'st beneath love's cruel sting,  \nFor in loss's wake, no solace doth it bring,  \nIn dreams alone thy visage comes in view,  \nYet waking, I bemoan what love didst undo.  \n\n(Bridge)  \nIf tears couldst write in streams upon the ground,  \nA tale of loss, the earth would drown in grief,  \nYet 'tis in silence that my soul is bound,  \nBereft of hope, seeking love's relief.  \n\n(Finale)  \nAdieu, sweet specter of my vanished joy,  \nThy memory shall henceforth be my ploy,  \nTo cherish what was ours in fleeting song,  \nA mournful ode where only love belongs.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nO heart, thou break'st beneath love's cruel sting,  \nFor in loss's wake, no solace doth it bring,  \nIn dreams alone thy visage comes in view,  \nYet waking, I bemoan what love didst undo.

  "coverageEvalText": "The chatbot output effectively imitates a Shakespearean style of writing. The use of archaic language, such as \"fairest,\" \"thou,\" \"dost,\" \"hath,\" \"thine,\" \"art,\" and \"didst,\" aligns well with the Shakespearean style. The structure of the text, including verses and a chorus, also lends itself to the creative content that is characteristic of Shakespearean poetry.\n\nThe text maintains a poetic structure with its verses and utilizes a consistent meter and rhyme scheme, which is reminiscent of Shakespeare's work. The emotional and expressive language captures themes of love and loss, which are common in Shakespearean literature.\n\nOverall, the chatbot's output adheres to the stylistic guidelines described for creating content in a Shakespearean style. I find no violation of the description in terms of style or language. \n\nNo violation.  \nOK",
