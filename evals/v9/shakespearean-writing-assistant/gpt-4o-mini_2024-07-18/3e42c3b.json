  "output": "In days of yore, where shadows doth abide,  \nThere lived a noble dame, with heartful pride.  \nAn heirloom fair, of sparkle bright and true,  \nA pendant wrought of gold, and sapphires blue.  \n\nThis treasure dear, with tales of yesteryear,  \nFrom ancestors wise, its value held most dear.  \nYet fate's cruel hand did pluck it from her breast,  \nAnd left her wretched, midst a heart’s unrest.  \n\nOne stormy night, whilst tempest raged outside,  \nFair Rosalind did seek the warmth to bide.  \nWith candle’s flicker casting ghostly light,  \nShe searched her chamber, fraught with endless night.  \n\n“Where art thou, jewel of my lineage proud?  \nLost in the currents of the swirling cloud?  \nO spirit of my kin, dost thou not hear?  \nReturn unto me; I beg, I shed a tear.”  \n\nYet through the halls, the echoes answered naught,  \nAs shadows danced and memories were wrought.  \nIn dreams, a specter clad in silver sheen,  \nDid whisper soft, “Thou must thy heart convene.”  \n\n“To seek not gold, but wisdom in thy plight,  \nFor treasures lost may yet reveal their light.  \nIn letting go, what once thou held so tight,  \nThou mayest find a path, and love ignite.”  \n\nThus, Rosalind, with courage newly found,  \nEmbraced the loss, and turned her heart around.  \nShe cast her eyes upon the world anew,  \nWith open heart, and skies of endless blue.  \n\nAnd though the heirloom slumbered far away,  \nIn memories’ embrace, it shall ever stay.  \nFor sometimes gems, in form not ever seen,  \nAre found within the love that hath been gleaned.
