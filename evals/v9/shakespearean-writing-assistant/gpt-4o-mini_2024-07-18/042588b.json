A folly to behold!  \nI crave the world, in iron grip to hold.  \nLet kingdoms quake beneath my ruthless hand,  \nFor what is mercy in this hardened land?  \n\n**Conscience:**  \nNay, seek not glory in the cries of pain;  \nThe crown of thorns doth only bring thee bane.  \nA heart that’s cold shall ne’er find peace or mirth;  \nWouldst thou, in darkness, lose thy chance at worth?  \n\n**Villain:**  \nThou hast no place in this, my dark domain,  \nFor vengeance fuels the fire in my veins.  \nYet still, thou whisper'st through the night so clear,  \nArt thou a phantom born of guilt and fear?  \n\n**Conscience:**  \nI am no phantom, but thy better part,  \nAwake, thou tempest, yield to mercy’s heart.  \nDestroy not all ’ere shadows claim thy throne;  \nIn kindness lies the strength thou hast not known.  \n\n**Villain:**  \nO, tumult fierce, my heart doth quake and sway;  \nShall I resist thee or give in to fray?  \nFor in thy voice lies both my doom and light,  \nWhat path to tread beneath the stars so bright?  \n\n**Conscience:**  \nChoose well, dear villain, for the night is long;  \nA heart made generous shall weave the strongest song.  \nThou canst still turn from vengeance and despair,  \nAnd find the peace that dwells ‘neath loving care.",
