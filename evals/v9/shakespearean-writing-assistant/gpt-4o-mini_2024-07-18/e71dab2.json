  "output": "### A Ballad of Betrayal\n\nIn yonder glade where shadows creep,  \nThere dwelt a heart so pure and deep,  \nIts owner trusted, loved, and gave,  \nYet found himself a silent slave.  \n\nUpon a morn, so bright and fair,  \nA friend approached with tender care,  \n“Fear not, dear soul, for I shall stand,  \nA faithful sword, a steadfast hand.”  \n\nBut lo! Beneath that smiling guise,  \nDid hide the serpent’s treacherous lies;  \nFor in the cloak of friendship's grace,  \nDid foul intent his heart embrace.  \n\nThrough whispered words and glances sly,  \nThe faithful beneath the tempest sigh,  \nFor hidden daggers pierced his pride,  \nBy one whom he did trust abide.  \n\nAs night did fall and shadows grew,  \nThe trust once forged now shattered true,  \nThe dagger struck, the heart did bleed,  \nA bitter tale of woe and greed.  \n\nO, treachery, thy name they call,  \nFor in thy grasp, great hearts do fall;  \nYet in the ashes, strength shall birth,  \nA wiser soul from sorrow’s dearth.  \n\nThus heed this tale of trust betrayed,  \nLet not thy heart be thus dismayed,  \nFor though the wound may fester deep,  \nA phoenix shall from ashes leap.
