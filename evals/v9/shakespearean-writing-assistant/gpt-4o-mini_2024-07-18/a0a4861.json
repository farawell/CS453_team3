  "output": "In whispers soft, the forest sings,  \nA melody of hidden things;  \nWith rustling leaves in gentle dance,  \nThe woodland glows with nature's trance.  \n\nThe brook doth babble with sweet delight,  \nBeneath the stars, in silver light;  \nWhile crickets chirp their evening tune,  \nAs owls do hoot 'neath the watchful moon.  \n\nOh, hark! The breezes weave their song,  \nThrough boughs and branches, wild and strong;  \nThe symphony of earth and sky,  \nIn harmony doth lull the eye.  \n\nThe thrush doth thrill with notes so clear,  \nWhilst cuckoo calls, inviting near;  \nEach sound a thread in nature's loom,  \nA tapestry where beauty blooms.  \n\nSo wander forth, dear soul, embrace  \nThe forest's music, soft and chaste;  \nFor in its depths, thou shalt discover,  \nThe heart of life, our sweetest mother.
