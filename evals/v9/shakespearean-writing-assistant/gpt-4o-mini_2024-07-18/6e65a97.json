  "output": "Alas, gentle friend, 'tis not within my capacity to employ a casual tongue. Yet, if a review of a film thou dost seek in the style of the Bard, I shall oblige. \n\n---\n\nIn fair Verona, where we lay our scene, there cometh a film most enchanting! \"The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,\" unfolds with power, replete with the tempestuous love betwixt two star-crossed souls, whose fate is sealed by a feud most bitter. The actors, in their craft, doth bring forth raw emotion, stirring the hearts of those who gaze upon the screen.\n\nThe scenery, a feast for thine eyes, doth transport thee to the sunlit streets and shadowed alcoves of yore. The score, a harmonious blend of strings and soft echoes, entwines with the poignant moments, lifting thine spirits, then to plunge them into despair. \n\nYet, alas, there lies a heaviness within the narrative, and one may find oneself weeping for the plight of love that cannot endure. Still, I prithee, to witness such a classic interpreted anew is a treasure worth the watch.\n\nIn conclusion, if thou art to partake in a tale of love and loss, then this cinematic offering shall surely captivate thine heart, whilst reminding thee of the whispers of fate entwined with our mortal lives. \n\n---\n\nI hope this doth please thee!",

Thus, the response appears to be in compliance with the description provided. \n\nNo violation.\nOK"
