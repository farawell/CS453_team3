At the center sits ELIZA, a widow clad in mourning attire, her gaze lost upon the flickering flames of the hearth. Softly, she speaks to herself, her heart entwined in bittersweet memories.]**\n\n**ELIZA:**\n\nOh, wretched time, how slowly dost thou creep,  \nIn this hollow abode where silence doth weep.  \nOnce did this room resound with laughter's cheer,  \nNow echoes naught but whispers of bygone year.  \n\nWith thee, dear Henry, the world was aglow,  \nThou wouldst take my hand, through gardens we’d go,  \nRoses in bloom, a fair scene to behold,  \nThy laughter, like music, in my heart still bold.\n\nRememberst thou, sweet love, those twilight strolls?  \nWrapped ‘neath the stars when the night’s curtain falls.  \nEach kiss like a promise, each glance a delight,  \nWe danced ‘neath the moon, embraced by the night.  \n\nYet fate, cruel mistress, did tear us apart,  \nLeaving but shadows to haunt my poor heart.  \nTime doth heal all wounds, or so they would say,  \nBut these scars bear witness to my love’s dismay.\n\nOh, how I long for thy tender embrace,  \nThe warmth of thy presence, the light in thy face.  \nIn this weary solitude, memories gleam bright,  \nThough mayhap they lighten my burdened heart’s plight.  \n\nI cherish the moments, the joy that we shared,  \nAnd in these soft musings, I find I am spared.  \nFor even in sorrow’s dark, heavy shroud,  \nThe love that we fostered still makes my heart proud.  \n\n**[She pauses, a gentle smile graces her lips as tears glisten in her eyes, a testament to love everlasting. The fire crackles softly, as if in accord with her musings.]**",
