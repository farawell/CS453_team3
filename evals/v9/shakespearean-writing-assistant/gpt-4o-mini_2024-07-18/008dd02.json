  "output": "**Queen's Monologue:**\n\nO heavy crown that rests upon mine head,  \nA symbol fair yet burdensome indeed!  \nFor what is wealth, if peace doth dwindle low?  \nWhat joy in power, if my subjects weep?  \nThis throne, a seat of glory, now doth groan  \nBeneath the weight of strife and bitter woes.  \n\nUpon the meadows where the children played,  \nThe laughter's echo fades, replaced by fear;  \nOur fields, once ripe, now barren and laid waste,  \nThe harvest lost to drought and dire despair.  \nWhat counsel holds my heart, what wisdom sought?  \nTo wield the sword or weave in mercy’s thread?  \n\nEach night I wrestle with disquiet’s grip,  \nAs shadows stretch across the candle’s light;  \nMy faith, a flick’ring flame upon the brink,  \nDoth lie, entwined ‘twixt hopes and darksome thoughts.  \nAm I a fool to dream of brighter days,  \nWhilst all around me crumbles into night?  \n\nAh, gentle realm, so tender and so dear,  \nI fear for thee, sweet land that I do love.  \nWhat future lies beyond this veil of tears?  \nShall I, the bearer of such heavy woes,  \nYet rise with grace, and guide thee to fair dawn?  \nTherein, I see a flicker of resolve;  \nFor though my heart be torn, I shall not yield,  \nBut strive to forge a path through tempest’s grief,  \nAnd wrap mine arms around this wayward crown,  \nFor thou art worth the battle, worth the fight—  \nTo lead thee forth into the hopeful light.",
