Nay, I am a son!  \nDid’st thou not hear our father’s words of pride?  \nHe spake of valor, of battles fought, and won,  \nAnd all this toil, I do not hide!\n\n**BRIANNA:**  \nPrithee, fool! Thy valor’s naught but show!  \nI, with skillful hands, craft treasures of gold,  \nWhile thou, in pursuit of shadows, dost but grow  \nTo be a jest, a tale oft retold.\n\n**ELDRED:**  \nIn golden dreams, thou art but lost in vain—  \nOur father’s soul doth yearn for spirit fierce.  \nDoth thou not see, thy quills bring naught but pain?  \nHis love is not for dreams that thou canst pierce.\n\n**BRIANNA:**  \nBut love, dear brother, art thou blind to see?  \nHe takes delight in works that shine and gleam!  \nOft hath he praised the art of destiny,  \nWherein my hands create what thine dare not dream.\n\n**ELDRED:**  \nThen let us challenge upon the field of worth!  \nProve whose merits doth win acclaim so bright.  \nCome, face me now, let’s show what brings true mirth—  \nI wager father’s pride shall be my light!\n\n**[They hear footsteps approaching, signaling their father. Both gather their tongues, knowing the quarrel remains unresolved.]**",
