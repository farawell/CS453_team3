Attend thee well, for here unfolds,  \nA tale of woe, where truth and fate behold,  \nA noble heart, Lord Alaric by name,  \nWhose shining virtue lendeth him no shame.  \n\nYet in his breast, a flaw doth dwell unseen,  \nAmbition’s whisper, tempting and unclean.  \nFor in his quest for glory, great and high,  \nHe strays from honor, ne’er to know the why.  \n\nThus shall we see, by hubris’s cruel hand,  \nHow pride may lead to ruin, grandly planned.  \nWith every step, his fate draws ever near,  \nA tragic fall, we shall all come to fear.  \n\nSo sit thee down, and lend a patient ear,  \nTo witness shadows cast by hope and fear.  \nIn love and loss, where noble hearts shall strive,  \nPrepare thy soul, for truth, in pain, shall thrive.  \n\n**Exeunt**",
