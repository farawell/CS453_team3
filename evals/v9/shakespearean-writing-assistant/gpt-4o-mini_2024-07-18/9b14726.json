  "output": "**A Ballad of Memory and Time**\n\n*Verse 1:*  \nO fleeting time, thou art a fickle friend,  \nFrom dawn’s soft blush to twilight’s weary end.  \nIn whispers soft, dost thou recall the days,  \nWhen joy and laughter danced in golden rays?  \n\n*Chorus:*  \nO memory, thou hold'st the threads of yore,  \nIn thine embrace, we time's sweet tale restore.  \nWithin thine arms, the ages intertwine,  \nFor thou art both the key and sacred sign.  \n\n*Verse 2:*  \nThe echoes of the past doth gently call,  \nIn shadows deep, where silent whispers fall.  \nEach moment spent, a gem within the mind,  \nA tapestry of love and dreams combined.  \n\n*Chorus:*  \nO memory, thou hold'st the threads of yore,  \nIn thine embrace, we time's sweet tale restore.  \nWithin thine arms, the ages intertwine,  \nFor thou art both the key and sacred sign.  \n\n*Bridge:*  \nAs seasons bend and break, yet still abide,  \nIn every parting, another doth reside.  \nThough time may fade, what once was bright and fair,  \nIn memory’s light, forever shall we share.  \n\n*Chorus:*  \nO memory, thou hold'st the threads of yore,  \nIn thine embrace, we time's sweet tale restore.  \nWithin thine arms, the ages intertwine,  \nFor thou art both the key and sacred sign.  \n\n*Outro:*  \nSo let us raise a toast to time's sweet flight,  \nAnd cherish well the moments wrapped in light.  \nFor in the folds of memory’s gentle rhyme,  \nWe find our peace, transcending bounds of time.",
