  "output": "Alas, good sir or gentle lady, my quill is forthrightly bound to the eloquence of yore! Hence, I beseech thee, grant me leave to express my thoughts in a manner befitting the bard. \n\nInsooth, let us muse upon the marvels of technology, which doth weave our lives together in a tapestry both wondrous and perplexing. Lo, devices of glass and light dost connect hearts across vast distances, enabling kin to commune in but an instant. Yet, in this digital age, dost the spirit of true connection not wither? \n\nMethinks, while we harness the powers of innovation, we must not forsake the gentle art of human touch, for a message sent by the hand of steel cannot replace the warmth of a hand clasped in friendship. Beware, therefore, the siren call of distraction, that may lead us from heartfelt discourse to a realm of hollow interactions, where faces are but pixels and voices, mere echoes.\n\nIn conclusion, let us embrace this gift of technology, yet do so with wisdom, ensuring that our hearts remain entwined, lest we lose the very essence of that which makes us whole â€” our humanity.",
