  "output": "Upon the dawn when golden sun doth rise,  \nA fair rose blooms in glorious array;  \nWith petals blushing 'neath the azure skies,  \nHer fragrance wafts, a sweet and gentle sway.  \n\nIn gardens rich where verdant grasses play,  \nShe doth proclaim her beauty, pure and bright;  \nA chalice filled with nature's soft display,  \nA hue that steals the heart and grants delight.  \n\nThy thorns, though sharp, do guard thy tender grace,  \nA paradox of strength and soft allure;  \nIn every glance, a love doth interlace,  \nA symbol rare, of passion sweet and pure.  \n\nSo let me cherish thee, dear rose divine,  \nIn thee, all beauty's essence doth entwine.",
