  "output": "O wretched fate, where once a kingdom stood,  \nNow shadows reign where light did brightly glow.  \nFair towers crumbled 'neath the weight of blood,  \nAnd verdant fields lie barren, stricken low.  \n\nThe banners, tattered, flutter in despair,  \nOnce filled with pride, now caught in tempest’s bite;  \nWhere merry voices sang in joyous air,  \nNow silence reigns, a testament to night.  \n\nThy throne, once gilded, now doth gather dust,  \nThe echoes of thy glory sweetly mourn;  \nFor power’s grasp hath turned to ash and rust,  \nAnd noble dreams in twilight's breath are borne.  \n\nThus weep I for thy fate, O realm so grand,  \nIn sorrow’s thrall, I pen with trembling hand.",
