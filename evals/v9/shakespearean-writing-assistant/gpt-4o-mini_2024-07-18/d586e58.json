  "output": "**Ode to the Ancient Oak Tree**\n\nO venerable oak, in thy grandeur doth rise,  \nWith roots that dig deep ‘neath the fairest skies,  \nThy branches spread wide, like a mother’s embrace,  \nIn the realm of the woods, thou dost hold thy place.  \n\nThrough seasons of autumn and winters so bleak,  \nThou standest unmoved, in thy silence doth speak.  \nWith leaves that in springtime dost flutter like dreams,  \nThou art witness to time and the world’s fleeting seams.  \n\nO majesty clad in a mantle of green,  \nIn whispers of breezes, thy presence is seen.  \nOld sentinel wise, keeper of secrets untold,  \nIn the tapestry of nature, thy tale is of old.  \n\nWith acorns like treasures, thou scatterest seeds,  \nNurturing life as thy boughs bend to heed.  \nIn the heart of the forest, loud echoes proclaim,  \nThe beauty thou bringest, and the life that thou claim.  \n\nSo let us give thanks for thy sheltering grace,  \nO ancient oak tree, in this hallowed place.  \nFor thou art a symbol of strength and of age,  \nA poem of life, written page after page.",
