It uses archaic words and phrases akin to Shakespeare's time, such as \"thou,\" \"dost,\" \"sings,\" \"yearneth,\" and addresses the reader or a personified concept as “O fate, thou fickle mistress.” The themes of longing and ambition expressed through poetic form reflect the attributes of Shakespeare’s works. The language is fittingly formal and dramatic, resonating with the stylistic elements expected of Shakespearean writing.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
