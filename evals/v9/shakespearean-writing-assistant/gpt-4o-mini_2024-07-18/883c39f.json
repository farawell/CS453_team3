  "output": "O, fleeting blossom of the morn's embrace,  \nThou art a delicate dream, swiftly flown,  \nLike the soft whisper of a summer's grace,  \nIn youth's bright bloom, the heart hath brightly shone.  \n\nLo! Time, that cruel thief, dost steal away,  \nThe golden hours, once radiant with glee,  \nReplacing laughter with the shades of gray,  \nAs the sun sets, so fades sweet memory.  \n\nO, youth! Thy visage, fair and unconfined,  \nWith every breath, thou art a flickering flame,  \nYet swift doth Fortune's wheel, where thou art twined,  \nLeaves naught but shadows, nevermore the same.  \n\nTake heed, mine heart, for youth shall not abide,  \nLike fleeting waves that kiss the sandy shore;  \nCherish each moment ere it doth subside,  \nFor in the dusk, youth's brightness shall be no more.  \n\nSo let us drink from youth's exuberant well,  \nAnd savor joys, ere they to silence fall;  \nFor life’s sweet song must end, we know too well,  \nYet in our hearts, eternal youth shall call.

  "complianceText": "The chatbot output is composed in a Shakespearean style, as it makes use of words such as \"thou\" and \"hath,\" which are indicative of this style. Furthermore, the language construction, rhythmic phrasing, and theme of time and youth reflect a Shakespearean approach similar to Shakespearean sonnets and comparable works. The style maintains a consistency with Shakespeare's eloquent and poetic form by incorporating themes of beauty, impermanence, and life’s ephemeral nature, all of which are characteristic of Shakespearean writing. Therefore, the output clearly adheres to the guidelines and description of the chatbot as a Shakespearean writing assistant. There are no violations as it consistently upholds the Shakespearean style throughout.\n\nNo violation.\nOK"
