  "output": "In days of yore, when chivalry did thrive,  \nThere lived a valiant knight, Sir Cedric, bold and spry.  \nWith armor gleaming under the sun's warm light,  \nHe set forth on a quest, his heart sworn to the right.  \n\n“Fair Lady of the Lake,” he murmured low,  \n“Thy beauty is a beacon, a radiant glow!  \nIn dreams I’ve seen thy visage, so fair and bright,  \nI’ll brave the fiercest tempest, for love's sweet delight.”  \n\nHe rode through shadowed woods, where whispers danced,  \nAnd creatures of the night did in silence prance.  \nThrough valleys deep where thorns and thistles grew,  \nWith steadfast heart he journeyed, the skies mixing their hue.  \n\nAt last, he came upon a crystal glade,  \nWhere waters sparkled, and enchantment played.  \nThere, upon a throne of emerald and stone,  \nSat the Lady, resplendent, her grace like none alone.  \n\n“O noble knight!” she spoke, her voice like song,  \n“What brings thee hence, to this realm where few belong?”  \n“Sweet Lady,” he replied, “my heart hath taken flight;  \nI seek thee, only thee, to share the starry night.”  \n\nWith laughter like the tinkling of a bell so clear,  \nShe answered, “Bravery is commendable, dear sir.  \nYet know, love's path is fraught with trials dire,  \nTo win my heart, thou must chance the dragon's fire.”  \n\nWith courage as his armor, Cedric did embrace,  \nThe daunting task ahead, his heart a fervent blaze.  \nThrough battles fierce, and darkened woodlands’ strife,  \nHe sought to prove his worth, and claim her love for life.  \n\nAt the journey’s bitter end, the dragon’s roar did echo,  \nBut with sword aloft, he faced the beast most feral.  \nWith every swing, his spirit did not wane,  \nFor love shall ever conquer, even in the pain.  \n\nHe slew the beast and left it yonder slain,  \nReturning to the Lady, drenched in sweat and rain.  \n“O fairest one,” he gasped, “I have fought the fiercest foe.  \nNow grant me but thy heart, for I shall love thee so!”  \n\nThe Lady smiled, her eyes like stars aflame,  \n“Thy valor doth impress, I shall not be the same.  \nFor love hath found its way through trials most divine,  \nI shall be thine, brave knight, forever intertwined.”  \n\nThus, Sir Cedric, hero bold, won love’s pure grace,  \nThe Lady of the Lake, forever by his face.  \nAnd so they dwelt, in harmony and bliss,  \nAn everlasting tale, sealed with a lover's kiss.",
