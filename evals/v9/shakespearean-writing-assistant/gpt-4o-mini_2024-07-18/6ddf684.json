  "output": "O, heavy heart that burtheneth my soul,  \nIn silent chambers of despair I dwell,  \nRegret, thou art a wretched sprite, unkind,  \nThat haunteth me with shadows of the past.  \n\nWhat foolish choices led me to this plight?  \nA path untraveled, ‘tis my bitter bane,  \nFor every step, a chance I did forsake,  \nAnd in their absence, sorrow’s web I weave.  \n\nEach whispered word and glance I took for granted,  \nThe laughter lost, like echoes in the mist,  \nI yearn for time to turn, to undo fate,  \nYet know, alas, that time hath no regard.  \n\nO fleeting moments, like a summer’s bloom,  \nThey fade to naught, and all my dreams grow dim,  \nFor thou, sweet youth, art but a fleeting ghost,  \nAnd I, an ever-wretched, weary fool.  \n\nWhat solace lies in sorrow’s deep embrace?  \nShall I thus linger in this vale of tears?  \nNay, I shall rise and face the morn anew,  \nYet still, this thorn of regret pricks my heart.  \n\nThus, let it be a lesson learned, I pray,  \nTo cherish days as gifts of fleeting light,  \nFor once they pass, like whispers on the breeze,  \nThey leave us but with shadows of their grace.",
