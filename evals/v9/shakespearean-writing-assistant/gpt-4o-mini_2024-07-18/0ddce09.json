  "output": "Upon the fleeting sands of time I muse,  \nAs shadows dance and steal the light away,  \nEach moment lost, a precious gem I lose,  \nYet time, relentless, doth not halt its sway.  \n\nThou gentle hours that flutter like the leaves,  \nDost whisper softly of the days long past;  \nIn memory's grasp, thy tender beauty weaves,  \nYet in thy wake, I find joy cannot last.  \n\nThe roses fade as summer yields to fall,  \nTheir petals droop, no longer fresh nor fine;  \nSo too my youth, once bright and standing tall,  \nNow wanes like twilight’s timid, pale decline.  \n\nYet in this sorrow blooms a wisdom bright,  \nFor life’s sweet journey doth reveal its light.",
