  "output": "In a verdant glade where soft winds dost play,  \nA cunning fox and a swift hare did stray.  \nThe fox, sly and wily, with coat of bright hue,  \nThe hare, fleet of foot, with eyes like the dew.  \n\nOne day, as they trotted 'neath the sun’s golden beam,  \nThe hare found a bounty—a most wondrous dream.  \nA banquet of carrots, fresh, crisp, and sweet,  \nWith tender green leaves, a most savory treat.  \n\n\"Oh, what joy is here!\" the young hare did exclaim,  \n\"But lo! To feast alone would be but a shame.\"  \nHe thought of the fox, his companion, so dear,  \nAnd in his kind heart, he wished to draw near.  \n\n“Good fox, pray attend, for a bounty I bear!  \nCome hither, dear friend, partake of my share!”  \nYet the fox, in his heart, felt a twinge of disdain,  \n“Why should I, when my cunning hath brought me no pain?”  \n\nThus, the hare, undaunted, with a gentle heart,  \nSaid, “Dear fox, thou art clever, that much is true,  \nBut wisdom, I think, lies in sharing thy due.  \nFor what use is feast when alone it is fared?  \nIt's the joy and the laughter of friendship that's shared.”\n\nWith a flick of his tail and a pause in his plight,  \nThe fox felt the warmth of the hare’s heart so bright.  \n“Aye, thou hast a point, kind friend of the field,  \nTo share in this bounty, my pride I must yield.”  \n\nSo they sat side by side, the fox and the hare,  \nDividing the carrots with nary a care.  \nThe laughter they shared echoed high through the trees,  \nAnd spurred on the winds like a gentle warm breeze.  \n\nThus, dear friends, remember, as this tale dost impart,  \nSharing brings joy to the soul and the heart.  \nFor riches are naught, if alone we must dwell;  \nIn friendship’s embrace, all is wondrous and well.",
