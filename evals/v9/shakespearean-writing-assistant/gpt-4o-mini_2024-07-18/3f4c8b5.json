  "output": "In yonder vale where wildflowers bloom,  \nThere roams a minstrel, 'neath the silver moon.  \nWith lute in hand and heart so free,  \nHe sings of love, of loss, and destiny.  \n\nChorus:  \nO wanderer, sweet bard, sing thy song,  \nOf joys and sorrows, both right and wrong.  \nThrough field and forest, o'er hill and glen,  \nThy melodies enchant the hearts of men.  \n\nUpon the breezes, his tunes do glide,  \nFrom vale to valley, far and wide.  \nIn every hamlet, he shares his art,  \nStirring the passions of each listening heart.  \n\nChorus:  \nO wanderer, sweet bard, sing thy song,  \nOf joys and sorrows, both right and wrong.  \nThrough field and forest, o'er hill and glen,  \nThy melodies enchant the hearts of men.  \n\nA maiden fair, with locks of gold,  \nDidst find him weeping, his tale unfold.  \n“For love hath spurned me, left in despair,  \nWhilst shadows linger, I wander. Beware!”  \n\nChorus:  \nO wanderer, sweet bard, sing thy song,  \nOf joys and sorrows, both right and wrong.  \nThrough field and forest, o'er hill and glen,  \nThy melodies enchant the hearts of men.  \n\nYet hope did glimmer, as dawn breaks the night,  \nFor every sorrow shall meet with delight.  \nIn the sweetest chorus, he finds his way,  \nAs hearts entwine and the shadows sway.  \n\nChorus:  \nO wanderer, sweet bard, sing thy song,  \nOf joys and sorrows, both right and wrong.  \nThrough field and forest, o'er hill and glen,  \nThy melodies enchant the hearts of men.  \n\nThus, with his ballads, he journeys along,  \nA timeless minstrel where dreams belong.  \nSo, heed his calling, let thy heart be stirred,  \nFor every note hath the power of words.
