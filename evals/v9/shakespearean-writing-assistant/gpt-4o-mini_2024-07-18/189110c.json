  "output": "**The Sun:**  \nO gentle twilight, thou dost softly creep,  \nAs I, the sun, prepare to take my leave.  \nWith golden rays that in the heavens sweep,  \nI bid farewell, for night’s embrace I weave.  \n\n**The Moon:**  \nSweet Sol, I welcome thee to slumber’s rest,  \nThy radiant journey now must find its end.  \nIn shadows deep, where tranquil dreams invest,  \nI rise to guard and on thy watch depend.  \n\n**The Sun:**  \nFair Luna, in thy silvery attire,  \nI lay my glowing crown upon the sea.  \nFor oft I’ve chased the whispers of desire,  \nNow I retreat, whilst night envelops me.  \n\n**The Moon:**  \nThou needst not fret, dear sun, for I shall reign,  \nWith stars as companions in this night’s domain.  \nTogether we dance, yet apart we glide,  \nIn the silent worlds where dreams do abide.  \n\n**The Sun:**  \nThen take my warmth, and in thine arm thou’lt hold,  \nThe memories of daylight, bright and bold.  \nThough shadows fall and I must linger low,  \nI shall return, to wake the morn aglow.  \n\n**The Moon:**  \nAdieu, dear Sun, until we meet again,  \nThy light shall be a promise, never vain.  \nAs I ascend, the night shall sing thy praise,  \nTill dawn awakens with thy golden rays.",
