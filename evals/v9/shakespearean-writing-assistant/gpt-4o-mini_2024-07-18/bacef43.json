  "output": "In days of yore, when gallant knights did roam,  \nThere lived a brave knight, Sir Cedric by name,  \nA valiant heart, adorned in silken chrome,  \nWith honor intertwined, he sought great fame.  \n\nTo him did cling a steed both strong and true,  \nA noble creature, by the name of Blaze,  \nWith mane like spun gold, and eyes of azure blue,  \nTogether they’d traverse the sun’s warm rays.  \n\nFrom dawn till dusk, their spirits intertwined,  \nThrough verdant fields and o’er the rugged hills,  \nThe knight in armor, his purpose well-defined,  \nThe steed, with grace, shared in his lofty thrills.  \n\nIn battles fierce, when tempests raged and roared,  \nBlaze galloped forth, his courage ever bold,  \nEach clash of sword, each thrilling chord,  \nTheir bond did strengthen as each tale unfolds.  \n\nUpon the eve, when stars adorned the sky,  \nSir Cedric whispered secrets soft and low,  \nIn Blaze’s gentle eyes, his confidante nigh,  \nTogether they dreamt of quests and lands to sow.  \n\nYet time is swift, as seasons swiftly turn,  \nAnd though the years did pass with gentle care,  \nSir Cedric grew weary, though still vibrant with yearn,  \nAnd Blaze's steps slowed, yet still he’d bear.  \n\nIn twilight years, as shadows stretched and sighed,  \nTogether they stood, companions till the end,  \nA knight and his steed, with hearts open wide,  \nIn loyalty forged, where love doth transcend.  \n\nThus, let it be known, in tales sung with glee,  \nThat friendship true knows neither bounds nor seams,  \nFor the bond of a knight with his steed shall be,  \nAn everlasting song, woven through their dreams.",
