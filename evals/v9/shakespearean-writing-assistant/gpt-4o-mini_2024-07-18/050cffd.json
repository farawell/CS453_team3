  "output": "*Enter the monk, alone in the cloister, gazing upon the stars above with furrowed brow.*\n\nO, sacred night, thou veilest 'neath thy shroud,  \nIn silence deep, my troubled thoughts enshroud.  \nWhat path is this, upon which I do tread,  \nWhere faith, once steadfast, now dost wane and shred?  \n\nIn the stillness of the hour, I do ponder,  \nCanst holy writst thy burden bear, I wonder?  \nFor shadows loom, and doubts like tendrils creep,  \nThy promises, O Lord, have cast me deep.  \n\nCanst thou hear my whispered pleas, my silent cries?  \nIn prayers that rise to thee, I still dost sigh.  \nYet, what is faith, if truths do twist and shift?  \nA fragile thing, with mounting doubt itâ€™s rift.  \n\nO! Have I misread the sacred scrolls of old?  \nDost thy love extend to hearts that hath grown cold?  \nShall I abandon that which hath been my creed,  \nOr trust the light within, to guide my need?  \n\nIn every chapel's shadowed corner lies,  \nA longing soul who seeks the sunlit skies.  \nSo, I beseech thee, grant but one clear sign,  \nIn this tempest of mind, let thy will align.  \n\nMayhap a voice, a whisper soft and near,  \nTo light the path, to quell my gnawing fear.  \nUntil such time, I shall in sorrow dwell,  \nDear God, dost thou exist? Could all be well?  \n\n*Exit the monk, with heavy heart, seeking solace.*",
