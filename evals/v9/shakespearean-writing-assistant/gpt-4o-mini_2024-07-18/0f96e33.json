  "output": "Upon the fragile wings of time do glide,  \nA tapestry of moments, swift and fleet,  \nEach breath a whisper, each step but a stride,  \nYet in their fleeting grace, doth life repeat.  \n\nThe rose, in bloom, doth wear the morn’s sweet dew,  \nHer petals soft, a treasure to behold,  \nBut lo! The twilight beckons, bids adieu,  \nAnd whispers tales of beauty left untold.  \n\nThe sun doth rise, illuminates the day,  \nYet 'tis a fleeting flame that burns so bright;  \nAs shadows stretch, it slowly fades away,  \nReminding hearts of life's most transient light.  \n\nSo let us pause and drink from joy’s fine cup,  \nFor beauty’s breath, like mist, shall soon go up.  ",
