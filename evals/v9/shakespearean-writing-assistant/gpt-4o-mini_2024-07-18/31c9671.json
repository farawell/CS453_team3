  "output": "O wandering spirit, how thy heart dost yearn,  \nLike stars that call upon the moon's gentle light,  \nIn chains of sorrow, dost thou ever burn,  \nThy cries for freedom echo through the night.  \n\nIn every shadow where the daylight fades,  \nThy captive breast doth ache for boundless skies,  \nWith every breath, the flick'ring hope invades,  \nA dream of flight where naught but freedom lies.  \n\nO freedom's song, how sweetly dost thou ring,  \nIn whispers soft as zephyrs on the breeze,  \nThou art the nectar that the heart doth bring,  \nTo quench its thirst, and grant the soul its ease.  \n\nSo rise, dear spirit, cast away thy chains,  \nAnd chase the winds where liberty remains.",
