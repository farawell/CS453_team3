  "output": "In yon fair bower, where the sun doth gently kiss the earth, there lies a garden rich with blooms, adorned in splendid white—the noble lilies dost sway in the soft zephyrs’ embrace. \n\nAmidst this tranquil splendor, the prince, weary of the burdens of crown and court, doth wander, his troubled heart unshackled beneath the verdant archway. Each step doth press into the cool and fragrant earth, releasing the scent of nature’s balm, a welcome reprieve from the clamor of his kin.\n\n“O, sweet solace!” he murmurs, “Here, where beauty doth reign, I inscribe my sorrows in the petals of the lilies that sway with grace.” He kneels, a gentle hand brushing the silken blooms, as if to draw strength from their unpretentious elegance. \n\n“Thou art the embodiment of quietude,” he sighs, “In thy gentle company I find peace, a fleeting respite from the tempest of my soul.” The prince, for a moment, becometh one with the garden, lost in a reverie where all cares dissolve like dew upon the morn. Thus, in the embrace of the lilies, he doth seek refuge, finding within their purity a flicker of hope to mend his weary heart.",
