A gentle breeze stirs, as the forlorn poet, with parchment and quill in hand, sits beneath a gnarled oak. He sighs heavily, gazing at the stars, his heart burdened by despair.*\n\n**(Enter MUSE, ethereal and radiant, clad in flowing robes that shimmer like starlight.)**\n\n**MUSE:**  \nGood morrow, dear poet, why dost thou weep?  \nWhat shadows darken thine heart and keep  \nThe sweet nectar of verse from thy lips?  \nSpeak, that I may lighten thy soul’s eclipse.\n\n**POET:**  \nAh, gentle Muse, once thou didst guide my hand,  \nBut now dost thou flee, like footprints in sand.  \nMy heart, like a withered rose, doth languish;  \nInspiration's flight hath left me in anguish.  \n\n**MUSE:**  \nNay, harken to me, thou seeker of light,  \nFor I am not gone, though obscured from thy sight.  \nThou hast but to summon, with fervent heart,  \nThe flame of thy passion; let it restart.\n\n**POET:**  \nBut wherefore shall I find such embers anew?  \nMy quill hath grown heavy, my thoughts come askew,  \nThe sonnets I penned, now but shadows of yore,  \nAnd my heart, once alive, beats faint at its core.\n\n**MUSE:**  \nIn the depths of despair, a spark thou must seek,  \nFor shadows give birth to the brightest of peaks.  \nRecall the joy of the fields in the spring,  \nLet nature’s sweet symphony awaken thy string.\n\n**POET:**  \nO Muse, thou art wise, with words like the breeze,  \nYet how canst I rise from this darkness with ease?  \nThe world hath grown silent, the stars dimmed their light,  \nAnd I, but a vessel, am lost in the night.\n\n**MUSE:**  \nFear not, noble bard, for thy heart hath a song,  \nWithin every sorrow, there lies a heart strong.  \nTake heed of thy troubles; weave them in rhyme,  \nFor art springs from anguish, transcending through time.\n\n**(The POET lifts his quill, and a flicker of hope ignites in his eyes.)**\n\n**POET:**  \nO Muse, thou hast kindled the flame I did seek,  \nWith each stroke of my quill, hear my heart as it speaks.  \nI shall write of the darkness, and also the light,  \nFor in this sweet struggle, I find the delight.\n\n**MUSE:**  \nThen let thy heart dance, let thy spirit take flight!  \nFor I shall be with thee, through day and the night.  \nArt’s essence is born from the depths of our woe,  \nNow rise, dear poet, and let thy voice flow!\n\n**(The MUSE fades into the mist, leaving the POET inspired. He begins to write fervently, as the moon casts its silvery glow upon him.)**  \n\n**POET:**  \nO Muse of my soul, thou art never far,  \nFor within every struggle, glimmers a star.  \nWith quill in my hand, I shall conquer the night,  \nAnd bring forth a dawn, resplendent and bright.  \n\n*(Exeunt.)*",
