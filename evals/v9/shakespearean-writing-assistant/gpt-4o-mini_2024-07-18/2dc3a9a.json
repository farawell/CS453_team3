The silver moon doth cast its gentle light,  \nAs shadows dance upon the glade this night.  \nOh, sweetened love, must thou away so soon?  \nThe stars above weep softly for our boon.\n\n**Lover B:** Alas, dear heart, the hour is at hand,  \nTo part we must, as destiny hath planned.  \nBut fret not, for my heart shall stay with thee,  \nNo distance can e’er sever love’s decree.\n\n**Lover A:** O cruel fate! Thy call doth pierce my soul,  \nEach moment spent apart, a heavy toll.  \nBut tell me, love, what promise canst thou weave?  \nThat in thine absence, I shall not grieve?\n\n**Lover B:** I pledge, by yonder moon and twinkling star,  \nTo hold thee close, no matter where thou art.  \nMy love shall shine like these celestial eyes,  \nA beacon strong, amid the darkest skies.\n\n**Lover A:** Then let thine words, like flowers, bloom in me,  \nTo nurture hope until we meet, my dearie.  \nYet, ere we go, a kiss to seal our vow,  \nA lingering taste of love’s sweet, sacred now.\n\n**Lover B:** *They embrace and kiss beneath the stars,*  \nFarewell, sweet love, till fortune hath us bound,  \nIn dreams, I’ll find thee, safe and sound.  \n**Lover A:** Until that day, I shall await thy call,  \nFor love, my dear, shall conquer all.",
