  "output": "O wretched hour when friendship’s light did fade,  \nWhen joy's bright sun was cloaked in shadow's pall,  \nWhat treachery hath wrought this cruel trade,  \nThat severed bonds which once did brightly thrall?  \n\nThou wert my solace in tempestuous seas,  \nTogether we danced through time’s fleeting embrace,  \nYet now, like whispers borne upon the breeze,  \nOur laughter lost, and bitterness takes place.  \n\nOft did we share sweet tales beneath the moon,  \nWith dreams aloft as stars in evening's dome,  \nBut now, despair hath claimed that joyous tune,  \nAnd solitude doth haunt my heart’s dear home.  \n\nForsooth, in memory dost thy visage gleam,  \nA specter of what once was pure and bright,  \nNow I lament like some forsaken dream,  \nLeft in the shadows, yearning for thy light.  \n\nMark hence the tale of friendship turned to rust,  \nA mournful echo of a once sweet trust.",
