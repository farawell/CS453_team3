Attend, good people of this noble land,  \nAs we gather 'neath the hallowed sky,  \nTo crown our valiant sovereign, Edmund true,  \nHis heart adorned with virtue’s golden hue.  \n\nO, witness now the rise of noble fate;  \nA crown of laurel rests upon his head,  \nAn emblem of his leadership and grace,  \nIn wisdom's sight, our trust shall be well bred.  \n\nBy God's own hand, he hath been chosen,  \nTo guard our realm, as shepherd tends his sheep;  \nWith strength of lion and a heart not frozen,  \nIn times of peace, and storms both loud and deep.  \n\nLet trumpets sound and joyous bells resound,  \nIn celebration of this blessed day!  \nLet voices rise, for glory doth abound,  \nAs here we stand to pledge our hearts' array.  \n\nO Edmund, thou who art our beacon bright,  \nMay love and justice guide thy noble reign;  \nWith loyal subjects gathered in delight,  \nWe pledge to thee our faith, our love, and gain.  \n\nSo let this moment linger in our hearts,  \nFor in thy reign, we seek a brighter morn;  \nNow rise, our King, while heaven’s choir imparts  \nA hymn of hope, anew, this crown is worn!  \n\nLong live King Edmund! Long may he reign,  \nWith honor, grace, o’er this vast domain!  \n",
