  "output": "Upon the eve when twilight’s veil doth fall,  \nThe starry skies, like diamonds strewn o’erall,  \nDoth twinkle bright with celestial grace,  \nEach gleaming orb a dream in boundless space.  \n\nYet, lo! Beneath the heavens vast and deep,  \nThe ocean waves in rhythmic pulses leap,  \nWith whispers soft, they kiss the sandy shore,  \nTheir foamy crowns doth dance forevermore.  \n\nAs stars do shimmer in the night’s embrace,  \nSo waves, with silvered crests, in mirrored space,  \nReflect the light of worlds both far and near,  \nA cosmic waltz that fills the heart with cheer.  \n\nO, what is ocean, if not heaven's tear,  \nOr night’s dark silk, where beauty doth appear?  \nBoth realms doth hold a majesty divine,  \nThe waves, the stars—such splendor intertwine.  \n\nThus, to the sky and sea my soul doth cling,  \nIn every breath, the songs of both they sing;  \nFor starlit nights and rolling tides do weave,  \nA tapestry of wonder we believe.",
