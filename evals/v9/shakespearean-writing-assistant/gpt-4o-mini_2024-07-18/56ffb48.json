Surely, 'tis but smoke,  \nA trick of mind, from which we shall not quake.  \nWe did what we must, 'tis fate that spoke,  \nWhy dost thou seek to cause our hearts to ache?  \n\n**Ghost:**  \nNay, know that vengeance is a bitter balm,  \nThat soothes the wounds of treason's cruel embrace.  \nThrough night’s embrace, I’ll weave my spiteful psalm,  \nAnd haunt thy dreams till time itself doth cease its pace.  \n\n**Villain 1:**  \nWe repent! We did not mean to cause thee pain!  \nLet not the past govern thy restless plight.  \n\n**Ghost:**  \nToo late for pity, too late for remorse,  \nPrepare thy hearts, for soon the reckoning comes.  \nUpon the morrow, I shall take my course,  \nAnd from the ground, thy guilty cries I’ll hum.  \n\n**Villain 2:**  \nO spirit, stay thy wrath and hear us now!  \nWe’ll make amends—our oaths we shall renew!  \n\n**Ghost:**  \nMark me well, thou base and wretched knaves,  \nThe winds of fate will guide my vengeful hand.  \nFor in thy hearts lies what the grave still saves—  \nA chill I bring, to reap what thou hast planned.",
